Research Associate at the [Institute for Genomic Biology](http://www.igb.uiuc.edu/) at the [University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign](http://www.uiuc.edu/), and part of the [Hudson Lab](http://stan.cropsci.uiuc.edu/people/index.php).

My Ph.D. is in Molecular and Cell Biology, and for the past 3 years I have been working on transcriptomics and metagenomics projects in the honey bee. Recently I have joined the [High-Performance Biological Computing](http://hpcbio.illinois.edu/) group (HPCBio) as the technical lead in user support and training.
