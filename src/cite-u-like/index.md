After more than 5 years on CiteULike, the [Galaxy Project's publication library](/src/publication-library/index.md) moved from CiteULike to [Zotero](https://www.zotero.org/groups/galaxy) in September 2017.  The Galaxy CiteULike library is still [online](http://www.citeulike.org/group/16008/), but it is no longer maintained.
