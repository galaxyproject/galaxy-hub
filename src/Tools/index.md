# Tools in Galaxy

Every Galaxy is much defined by its tools. You can either use them as a user, install them as an admin or you contribute to the community by writing tools or preparing them for use with Galaxy as a tool developer.

## Using tools

Extensive help on how to use a particular tool in Galaxy is often included on the tool page itself, inside Galaxy.  To see this help, click on a tool in the left tool panel, and then scroll to the bottom of the center panel.  Help includes parameter explanations, links to the tool developer's help pages, and examples. For further help with Galaxy and Galaxy tools don't hesitate to contact us via the [Galaxy Biostar support site](/src/support/Biostar/index.md).

For general help on using Galaxy, see [Learn](/src/Learn/index.md).

## Installing and creating tools

Please see [tool page](/src/Admin/Tools/index.md) for administrators to learn how to add tools to your Galaxy.
