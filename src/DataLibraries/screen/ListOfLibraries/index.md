# Screen: List Of Libraries

This is the screen that you reach from the top Galaxy menu under 'Shared Data'.

It lists all libraries visible to you. Basic interaction overlay follows:

![Galaxy Deployment Catalog](/src/DataLibraries/screen/ListOfLibraries/screen_listoflibraries.png)

Permissions notes:
* Everybody (including anonymous users) sees libraries that are public.
* If you are logged in you also see the ones that your user has access to.
* Only people with proper permissions see the controls to modify the library and change its permissions.
* Only [administrators](/src/Admin/index.md) see deleted libraries and can create new ones.
