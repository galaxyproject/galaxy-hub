Galaxy is a powerful and open, web-based platform, which is accessible to all scientists. For the beginner, it can be difficult to know how to select from the thousands of available tools, which ones are right for your data analysis. 

In addition, for microbiology, few public Galaxy servers are available and their use could limited to subscribers or collaborators only. Many tools, which specially designed for microbiology, are not available in Galaxy main.

At [Noor Biotechnologies](http://noorbiotech.com/) we support your genomics research by:

1. Helping you identifying the correct genomics applications that answer your research questions.
2. Providing support in the design of your sequencing experiment.
3. [Training](#training) you in using Galaxy for high throughput data analysis.
4. Providing help in selecting the correct bioinformatics tools and work workflows on either public Galaxy servers or to customize your own local Galaxy server.
5. Offering a deep understanding of microbial genomics. 

With [Noor Biotechnologies](http://noorbiotech.com/), you can make sense of your microbial genomics data


# Servers

## BioTeam Appliance: Galaxy Edition

The [BioTeam Appliance Galaxy Edition](http://www.bioteam.net/products/galaxy-appliance/) is 

<div class='right'><a href='http://www.bioteam.net/products/galaxy-appliance/'><img src='/Images/Logos/BioTeamLogo154.gif/' alt='BioTeam Appliance Galaxy Edition' /></a></div>

 a push-button solution that let’s researchers get up and running quickly with Galaxy.  The Galaxy Appliance comes preinstalled with a production instance of Galaxy, bioinformatics tools, and reference datasets. This powerful system is specifically configured for computationally intensive scientific workloads. Most importantly, the Galaxy Appliance is an open system so researchers and can install whatever tools they need and use the server as their own high-performance informatics infrastructure outside of Galaxy. [BioTeam](http://www.bioteam.net/) provides ongoing support for the Galaxy Appliance, enabling researchers to minimize their IT burden. The Galaxy Appliance is used by researchers around the world for metagenomic, ChIP-Seq, RNA-Seq analysis and more.

# Hosting and Commercial Cloud Solutions

</div>

[/CloudMan](/CloudMan) and [Globus Genomics](/Cloud/#globus-genomics) are two ways to deploy your own Galaxy server using [Amazon Web Services](http://aws.amazon.com). CloudMan can also run on any cloud provider that supports the [OpenStack](http://openstack.org) or [OpenNebula](http://opennebula.org) cloud management protocols.  This covers the vast majority of commercial cloud providers.

See the Galaxy [/Cloud](/Cloud) page for more.

## Galaxy Specific Commercial Cloud Solutions

These vendors provide support for running Galaxy on cloud infrastructures:

### GenomeCloud

From [GenomeCloud](http://www.genome-cloud.com):
<div class='indent'>
[GenomeCloud](http://www.genome-cloud.com) started with combining the idea of cloud computing with bioinformatics as an integrated solution for data storage and sharing, database management, upgrading computing and analysis tools, and security. 

[GenomeCloud](http://www.genome-cloud.com) is designed to aid biologists and researchers to perform bioinformatics tasks easier, as  well as support small-sized laboratories to perform researches without hurdles. 

[GenomeCloud](http://www.genome-cloud.com) is composed of g-Analysis, g-Cluster, g-Storage, and g-Insight services, where accounts creation and management, monitoring systems, billing, and service management are offered via KT's proven superior cloud-based web system, providing convenience to the researchers and other users. 

Users can easily use Galaxy using g-Cluster based on cloud computing.
