Galaxy is a powerful and open, web-based platform, which is accessible to all scientists. For the beginner, it can be difficult to know how to select from the thousands of available tools, which ones are right for your data analysis. 

In addition, for microbiology, few public Galaxy servers are available and their use could limited to subscribers or collaborators only. Many tools, which specially designed for microbiology, are not available in Galaxy main.
