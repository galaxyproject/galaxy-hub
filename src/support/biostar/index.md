## Introduction

<div class='right'><a href='https://www.biostars.org/'><img src="/src/images/Logos/BiostarLogo.png" alt="Biostar" width="180" /></a></div>

[Galaxy Biostars](https://biostar.usegalaxy.org/) is an instance of the popular Q&A site [Biostars](https://www.biostars.org/), runs at [https://biostar.usegalaxy.org/](https://biostar.usegalaxy.org/) and is aimed directly at the needs of the Galaxy community. The software is open source at [GitHub](https://github.com/ialbert/biostar-central) and the running version is under control of the Galaxy Team.

Galaxy Biostars is a community forum-like platform for asking specific questions inspired by Stack Exchange sites. Its usage should be straightforward and some of the basics can be found at the [about](https://biostar.usegalaxy.org/info/about/) page.

## Integration

Galaxy Biostars is directly integrated into the [Galaxy](http://usegalaxy.org) user interface and is available right when help is wanted!

#### Sharing Accounts

Every user on the public [Main Galaxy](/src/Main/index.md) server can access Galaxy Biostar directly through the menu **Help &rarr; Galaxy Biostar**.

A Galaxy Biostars account will be created automatically on the first access and the user will be automatically logged in to it transparently while accessing it through [http://usegalaxy.org](http://usegalaxy.org) when also logged in.
<br />

If a user ever wants to log in to Galaxy Biostars directly, a password reset request can be made at: [https://biostar.usegalaxy.org/accounts/password/reset/](https://biostar.usegalaxy.org/accounts/password/reset/).
