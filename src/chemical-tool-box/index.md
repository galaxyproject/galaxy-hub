# ChemicalToolBox

The ChemicalToolBoX is a set of tools integrated into the Galaxy-workflow-management system to enable researchers easy-to-use, reproducible, and transparent access to cheminformatics libraries and drug discovery tools. It includes standard applications for similarity and substructure searches, clustering of compounds, prediction of properties and descriptors, filtering, and many other tools that range from drug-likeness classification to fragmentation and fragment-merging. By combinating the various tools many more powerful applications can be designed.

[ChemicalToolBox](/src/ChemicalToolBox/index.md) is based on open-source software, web-accessible, freely available, and easily expandable. It can be downloaded and easily deployed locally or on a large scale cluster.

[ChemicalToolBox](/src/ChemicalToolBox/index.md) is developed by Björn Grüning on [Github](https://github.com/bgruening/galaxytools/tree/master/chemicaltoolbox)

[ChemicalToolBox](/src/ChemicalToolBox/index.md) can be installed from the toolshed by means of a metapackage containing all other dependencies, e.g. chemfp, openbabel, osra, confab, rdkit. [ChemicalToolBox ToolShed repository](http://toolshed.g2.bx.psu.edu/view/bgruening/chemicaltoolbox)

We set up an example [workflow](http://toolshed.g2.bx.psu.edu/view/bgruening/chemicaltoolbox_merging_chemical_databases_workflow) to for the preparation of a large compound library by merging of chemical databases. This workflow is part of case study demonstrating the capability of the chemicaltoolbox. For further information please have a look at the [chemicaltoolbox ](https://github.com/bgruening/galaxytools/tree/master/chemicaltoolbox).
