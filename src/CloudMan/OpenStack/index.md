Details on running [CloudMan](/src/CloudMan/index.md) on OpenStack-based cloud infrastructures. This is an active area of development for the [CloudMan Team](/src/CloudMan/Team/index.md).

[John Chilton](/src/JohnChilton/index.md) has made available [a set of scripts and config files](https://github.com/jmchilton/cloudman_openstack_bootstrap) he uses to setup customized CloudMan instances on OpenStack. They do not represent a turn-key solution and would require significant modification, but it is a potential place to start looking for ideas on this topic.
