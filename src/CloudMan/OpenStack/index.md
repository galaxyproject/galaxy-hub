INCLUDE(/CloudMan/LinkBox)

Details on running [/CloudMan](/CloudMan) on !OpenStack-based cloud infrastructures. This is an active area of development for the [CloudMan Team](/CloudMan/Team).

[John Chilton](/JohnChilton) has made available [a set of scripts and config files](https://github.com/jmchilton/cloudman_openstack_bootstrap) he uses to setup customized CloudMan instances on OpenStack. They do not represent a turn-key solution and would require significant modification, but it is a potential place to start looking for ideas on this topic.
