# Enis Afgan

I am an Associate Research Scientist in the [Taylor Lab](http://taylorlab.org/) at Johns Hopkins University. With that, I am also an active member of the Galaxy project. As part of ongoing collaboration, I am also affiliated with the [Center for Informatics and Computing](http://www.irb.hr/en/cir/) at the [Ruđer Bošković Institute (RBI)](http://www.irb.hr/eng/).

The focus of my current work is in the area of cloud and distributed computing. I actively work on (1) the CloudMan application providing comprehensive (bioinformatics) analysis environments on cloud computing resources and (2) a federated model of efficient job execution leveraging data locality. The general aims are to enable the needed computations to be performed in the most accessible and efficient way possible.

Overall, my research interests lay in the area of distributed computing accessibility, system automation, and application jobs performance tuning.
