The [UseGalaxy](/src/use/index.md) servers are [publicly accessible Galaxy servers](/src/use/index.md) that [will support](#work-in-progress)
 a common and synchronized set of tools and reference genomes.
These servers have significant computational resources behind them and are capable of powering large user communities. Some may have a regional focus, but they are all accessible to anyone.

# Servers

There are currently three UseGalaxy servers:

## UseGalaxy.org

[UseGalaxy.org](https://usegalaxy.org) is the Galaxy Project's publicly accessible server.  It was the original Galaxy server and has over 100,000 registered users, and is supported by significant computational resources at the Texas Advanced Computing Center (TACC).

## UseGalaxy.eu

[UseGalaxy.eu](https://usegalaxy.eu/) is a publicly accessible server that aims to support the analysis and sharing needs of the European research community.  It was launched in March 2018 at European Galaxy User Meeting in Freiburg.  It is hosted at the University of Freiburg.

## UseGalaxy.org.au

[UseGalaxy.org.au](https://usegalaxy.org.au) aims to support the Australian research community.  It is built on the Genomics Virtual Laboratory infrastructure, and was also launched in March 2018. This server was formerly the University of Queensland Galaxy Server.


(See the [UseGalaxy server directory](/src/use/index.md) for more information on each.)

# Status

The uptime status of all UseGalaxy servers, as well as other key Galaxy resources, [is shown here](https://status.galaxyproject.org/). The status page *currently tracks whether the sites load at all - there may still be issues with subsystems like job scheduling that are not reported here yet.*

# Work in Progress

This effort was launched in March 2018 and is very much a work in progress.  Support for a synchronized set of core tools and reference genomes is not yet implemented.  (It is one of our first goals.)  We also have long term goals that include welcoming other servers, and (really long term) things like integrated login and federation support.
