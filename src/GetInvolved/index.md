*Galaxy* is an open source project.  What makes an open source project work is the community that supports it.  There are numerous ways for people to *get involved* with Galaxy.

# Mailing Lists
<div class='left'><a href='/MailingLists'><img src='/Images/Logos/MailmanLogoSmall.png' alt='Galaxy Mailing Lists' width="64" /></a></div> Galaxy has *thousands* of users around the world, all using Galaxy in different and often novel ways.  When these users have a question or a topic to discuss, they post it to a [Galaxy Mailing List](/MailingLists) (following [/Support](/Support) guidelines), where the whole community can respond.  You can contribute by posting your own questions, solutions, and experience.

# Develop Tools and Tool Definitions

<div class='right'><a href='/Tool Shed'><img src='/Images/Logos/ToolShed.jpg' alt='Galaxy Tool Shed' width="170" /></a></div>
There are thousands of useful bioinformatics tools in existence and the Galaxy [/Main](/Main) server (and the [Galaxy Team](/GalaxyTeam)) cannot possibly support all of them.  Only tools that are widely useful in many areas of biomedical research (and meet several other criteria) are available on Main.

The Galaxy [/Tool Shed](/Tool Shed) is a means to make other tools available for use within local and cloud-based Galaxy instances.  You can create tool wrappers (usually a simple file encapsulating how Galaxy should treat the underlying software tool) in order to define tools within Galaxy.  In order to share your tool with everyone, you can upload any given wrapper to the [/Tool Shed](/Tool Shed) where it can be downloaded and installed into any Galaxy instance worldwide. To get you started we prepared this [Adding tool tutorial](/Admin/Tools/Add Tool Tutorial) for you.

If you want to make your tool available to the entire Galaxy ecosystem, please contribute a tool wrapper to the [/Tool Shed](/Tool Shed).

# Sharing Galaxy Objects

You can help other users by [sharing or publishing your Galaxy histories, workflows, and datasets](/Share) with other Galaxy users.  This allows others to examine your analysis in detail (histories), to reuse your analysis with their own input data (workflows), and to use your results in their own analysis (datasets).

You can also go a step further and document your analysis using [Galaxy Pages](/Learn/GalaxyPages).  These are online documents which are tightly integrated with your Galaxy objects - they provide a written explanation of your analysis.

# Report, Comment on and Vote on Issues and Features Requests

Have an idea for a feature?  Found a bug?  You can submit reports on issues and potential features, see what others have submitted, and comment and vote on anything on the https://github.com/galaxyproject/galaxy/issues .

# Setup a Public Server

If and when you [setup your own Galaxy instance](/Admin/GetGalaxy), you can make it available to researchers outside your organization.  A number of groups [have done this](/Public Galaxy Servers), often making a different tool set from Main available.  See [/Public Galaxy Servers](/Public Galaxy Servers).

# Share Your Deployment Experience

<div class='left'>![Galaxy Deployment Catalog](/Images/Logos/GalaxyDeploymentCatalog200.png)</div> 

The [Galaxy Deployment Catalog](/Community/Deployments) includes infrastructure and management details on how local Galaxy deployments are installed.  If you have a local deployment, then please [share with the community how you did it](/Community/Deployments).

<div class='right'>![Galaxy Community Log Board](/Images/Logos/LogBoardWText200.png)</div>

If you have implemented a particular feature or have addressed a particular challenge with a certain Galaxy deployment, you can describe and/or link it on the [Galaxy Community Log Board](/Community/Logs).  Log board entries describe specific implementation and solutions for specific situations.  Got some experience that would be useful for others to know?  Please [share it](/Community/Logs).

# Documentation

This wiki contains a large amount of documentation about using and administering Galaxy.  You can help keep this wiki current and relevant by maintaining it and by addressing gaps in the current documentation.  See [/Wiki Help](/Wiki Help) for more on updating this wiki.

# Code

<div class='right'>![GitHub](/Images/Logos/GitHubLogoText.png)</div>

Galaxy is an open source project.  Anyone can [contribute to the code](/Develop).

You can also update the [source code documentation](/Develop/SourceDoc), which is present as [Sphinx / RST](/Develop/SourceDoc) Python docstrings in the code.

# Events

Galaxy has a presence at many [/Events](/Events) throughout the year.  This includes annual Galaxy meetings ([2014](/Events/GCC2014), [2013](/Events/GCC2013), [2012](/Events/GCC2012), [2011](/Events/GCC2011), [2010](/Events/GDC2010)); workshops, tutorials, and talks at [meetings, conferences, and courses](/Events); and special events like the [NBIC Galaxy Hackathon](https://wiki.nbic.nl/index.php/NBIC_Galaxy_Hackathon_project).  See [/Events](/Events) for a complete list and a link to Google Calendar.

# Outreach
