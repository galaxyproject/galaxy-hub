Dave and Srinivas will lead a discussion following up on the issues that were raised at the [GCC2013 GalaxyAdmins Birds-of-a-Feather session](/src/Events/GCC2013/BoF/GalaxyAdmins/index.md).

[Nate Coraor](/nate) will also discuss the recent move of [usegalaxy.org](http://usegalaxy.org) from Penn State to TACC.

## GCC2013 Followup

The [GCC2013 GalaxyAdmins Birds-of-a-Feather session](/src/Events/GCC2013/BoF/GalaxyAdmins/index.md) was well-attended and resulted in a number of suggestions for the group moving forward.  One of those suggestions was to spend the next call on followup, so that's what we are doing.

### Reference / Wiki

Action items from BoF:

* Want a knowledge base with different descriptions of Galaxy Deployments
* Possibly have an Admin/Logs section where people can describe what they did
* Add a list of Admin Tutorials to Admin and Cloud Hub pages, similar to what is on the Learn hub page. 

Draft implementations of the first two are in place:

* [/Community/Deployments](/src/Community/Deployments/index.md) hub page
* [/Community/Logs](/src/Community/Logs/index.md) hub page

What do people think of this approach?  The use of *boxes* on the right side is used to create much more informative lists of deployments and logs on their hub pages, using the [http://moinmo.in/MacroMarket/DictColumns](http://moinmo.in/MacroMarket/DictColumns) macro.

### Mailing Lists / Forums

Decided against creating a separate GalaxyAdmins mailing list.  See [BoF page](/src/Events/GCC2013/BoF/GalaxyAdmins/index.md#mailing-lists--forums) for details.

### Meetups

* Next meetup may be at a more Asia/Australia friendly time.

### Leadership / Governance

Notes from the BoF:
* Nothing was established here.
* Srinivas and Dave C will continue as is, but the right thing to do is transfer Srinnivas's responsibilities to someone else.
* Participants will think about what to do
* Distributing workload might work
* Dave's willing to continue lining up speakers every other month.

## Call Technology

We will use the [University of Iowa's Blackboard system](../WebinarTech) for the call. **Downloading and launching the required Java application takes a few minutes. Using a headphone with microphone to prevent audio feedback during the call is recommended.**
