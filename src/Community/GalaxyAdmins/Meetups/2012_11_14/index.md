*We also bid farewell to [Ann Black-Ziegelbein of the University of Iowa](https://www.linkedin.com/pub/ann-blackziegelbein/a/166/117).*  Ann has been the driving force behind launching the [GalaxyAdmins|GalaxyAdmins](/src/Community/index.md) group and has guided it through its first (wildly successful!) 6 months of existence.  Ann is handing over the reigns to her fellow U Iowa colleague Srinivas Maddhi, whose day job is getting Iowa's Galaxy server into production.  

We thank Ann profusely for her contributions, and Srinivas for taking this on.

## Call Technology

We used the [University of Iowa's Blackboard system](../WebinarTech) for the call. Some care is needed to avoid getting feedback with participants without headphones. Therefore, *headphones are strongly encouraged.*
