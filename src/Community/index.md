Galaxy is driven and supported by its user and developer communities.  This page attempts to bring together everything loosely related to community into one place.

# Membership

Any organization, group, or individual who [uses](/Learn), [deploys](/Admin), or develops Galaxy is considered a part of the Galaxy community.  Community members are free to integrate their own tools and/or data into Galaxy.  Members within the Galaxy community are located all around the world.  Subgroups within the overall community may differ in size (small versus large) and/or degree of privacy (public versus private).  However, regardless of affiliation, Galaxy's primary mission is to contribute to research in a wide variety of fields across the tree of life.    

In short, the Galaxy community includes anyone who works with Galaxy in any capacity.  We are wide open.

Want to share how you addressed a particular challenge in your Galaxy deployment?  [Log entries](/Community/Logs) describe specific solutions to a wide variety of different issues within Galaxy. For example, one can use the logs to find details concerning what steps were taken to deploy Galaxy on particular platforms (or with particular software). It's an easy way to help others learn from what you've already done and avoid reinventing the wheel.
