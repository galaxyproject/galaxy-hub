<div class='center'>![Galaxy Community Log Board](/Images/Logos/LogBoardWText200.png)</div>


The *Galaxy Community Log Board* is a place to share how you addressed a particular task in your Galaxy deployment.  Log entries describe specific solutions to particular tasks, such as the details of what steps were taken to deploy Galaxy on particular platforms, or with particular software. It's an easy way to help others (and learn from others) by sharing what you've already done.

So, if you have figured out how to do something, and it took you a while, then this is the ideal forum for sharing that information with the community.
