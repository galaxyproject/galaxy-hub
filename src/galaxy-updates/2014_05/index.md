Welcome to the May 2014 *[Galaxy Update](/src/GalaxyUpdates/index.md)*, a monthly summary of what is going on in the Galaxy community. *[Galaxy Updates](/src/GalaxyUpdates/index.md)* complement the *[Galaxy Development News Briefs](/src/DevNewsBriefs/index.md)* which accompany new Galaxy releases and focus on Galaxy code updates.  

# Galaxy Biostar

<div class='right'><a href='https://biostar.usegalaxy.org/'><img src="/src/images/Logos/GalaxyBiostar.png" alt="Galaxy Biostar"  /></a></div>

**Galaxy has teamed up with [Biostar](http://biostars.org) to create [Galaxy Biostar](https://biostar.usegalaxy.org), a Galaxy User support forum.**

Galaxy Biostar is a space where researchers using Galaxy come together and share both scientific advice and practical tool help.  Whether on [usegalaxy.org](https://usegalaxy.org), a CloudMan instance, or any other Galaxy ([public](/src/PublicGalaxyServers/index.md) or local), if you have something to say about *Using Galaxy*, this is the place to do it.

**Current integration with usegalaxy.org**

* The **whole history of the `galaxy-user@bx.psu.edu`** mailing list was imported into *[Galaxy Biostar](https://biostar.usegalaxy.org)*. Your prior posts are automatically claimed when you login! 
* If you access [Galaxy Biostar](https://biostar.usegalaxy.org) from [usegalaxy.org](http://usegalaxy.org) (Menu: **Help &rarr; Galaxy Biostar**) you will be automatically logged in. A Galaxy Biostar account will be created for you if it did not previously exist. To obtain this account’s password please use the [password reset feature](https://biostar.usegalaxy.org/accounts/password/reset/) of Galaxy Biostar.
* When you have a question, search Galaxy Biostar directly from any Galaxy tool page.

Read more about how to get started on the [Biostar wiki page](/src/support/Biostar/index.md) or on the [Biostar](https://biostar.usegalaxy.org/p/7287/) [itself](https://biostar.usegalaxy.org/p/7288/).

**Roll-out phase**

* [Galaxy Biostar](https://biostar.usegalaxy.org) is available at [biostar.usegalaxy.org](http://biostar.usegalaxy.org) and will be our primary avenue for end-user support
* The galaxy-user@bx.psu.edu mailing list will continue to be supported during the transition but starting now please use the [Galaxy Biostar forum](https://biostar.usegalaxy.org) to ask all questions about using Galaxy.
* Please *do not double post* to both [Galaxy Biostar](https://biostar.usegalaxy.org) and galaxy-user@bx.psu.edu
* *Send us feedback in [this Biostar post](https://biostar.galaxyproject.org/p/7288/)* to tell us what you think. *We care.*

**What’s next**

* Notice will be given when the galaxy-user@bx.psu.edu mailing list is retired.
* [Archives of galaxy-user@bx.psu.edu](http://user.list.galaxyproject.org/) will remain accessible.

Galaxy Biostar was launched on April 23.  We hope you like the change and look forward to any feedback you may have.

# Events

## GCC2014: June 30 - July 2, Baltimore

<div class='right'><a href='/src/events/GCC2014/index.md'><img src="/src/images/Logos/GCC2014LogoTall200.png" alt="GCC2014: June 30 - July 2" width="150" /></a></div>

The [2014 Galaxy Community Conference (GCC2014)](/src/events/GCC2014/index.md) will be held June 30 through July 2, at the [Homewood Campus](http://webapps.jhu.edu/jhuniverse/information_about_hopkins/campuses/homewood_campus/) of [Johns Hopkins University](http://jhu.edu), in [Baltimore, Maryland](http://visitors.baltimorecity.gov/), United States.

### Early Registration Closes May 23

[Early registration closes the month](/src/events/GCC2014/Register/index.md). *Early registration saves more than 70% on registration costs, and [Training Day](/src/events/GCC2014/TrainingDay/index.md) registration is an additional 55% off if you register for both at the same time.*  This is by far the most affordable option, with early registration fees starting at less than $50 per day.  When you register you can also reserve [lodging at Charles Commons](/src/events/GCC2014/Logistics/index.md#lodging), a very affordable housing option in the same building as the conference.

*[Training Day](/src/events/GCC2014/TrainingDay/index.md)* is an opportunity to learn about all things Galaxy including using Galaxy, deploying and managing Galaxy, extending Galaxy, and Galaxy internals.  There are 5 parallel tracks, each with 3 sessions, with each of those sessions two and half hours long.  *That's 15 sessions and over 37 hours of workshop material.*

<div class='right'><br /><br /><a href='http://ccb.jhu.edu/people/salzberg/'><img src="/src/events/GCC2014/Abstracts/Salzberg.jpg" alt="Steven Salzberg" width="125" /></a></div>

### Keynote Speaker: Steven Salzberg

We are pleased to announce that [Steven Salzberg](http://ccb.jhu.edu/people/salzberg/) will be the keynote speaker at GCC2014.  Steven is a Professor of Medicine, [Biostatistics](http://www.biostat.jhsph.edu/), and [Computer Science](http://www.cs.jhu.edu/) at the [Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine](http://www.hopkinsmedicine.org/som/) where he is also Director of the [Center for Computational Biology](http://ccb.jhu.edu/) at the [McKusick-Nathans Institute of Genetic Medicine](http://igm.jhmi.edu/).  Steven has made many prominent contributions to open source software, including several of the most popular tools used on Galaxy Platforms.  Recently he was awarded the  [2013 Benjamin Franklin Award for Open Access in the Life Sciences](http://www.bioinformatics.org/forums/forum.php?forum_id=10206), and the [2012 Balles Prize in Critical Thinking](http://www.csicop.org/news/show/skeptic_authors_steven_salzberg_and_joe_nickell_to_receive_balles_prize) for his [science column](http://www.forbes.com/sites/stevensalzberg/) at [Forbes](http://www.forbes.com/).

Steve's GCC2014 talk will be on "Transcriptomes and Exomes: Computational Challenges of NGS Data."  

### Galaxy Hackathon at GCC2014

<div class='left'><a href='/src/events/GCC2014/Hackathon/index.md'><img src="/src/images/Logos/GCC2014HackLogoSquare.png" alt="GCC2014 Hackathon" width="150" /></a></div>

The very first [Galaxy Project Hackathon](/src/events/GCC2014/Hackathon/index.md) will be a three day event taking place at Johns Hopkins immediately preceding [GCC2014](/src/events/GCC2014/index.md) from June 28th-30th.

Do you have a feature you've always wanted to implement?  Just want to hack on Galaxy (or CloudMan!) with other folks?  The [Galaxy Hackathon](/src/events/GCC2014/Hackathon/index.md) will be a great opportunity to meet and work closely with other community and [Galaxy Team](/src/GalaxyTeam/index.md) members over the course of three days, culminating in some really great improvements and new features to show off at the [Galaxy Community Conference](/src/events/GCC2014/index.md) afterward.

Participation in the hackathon itself is completely free, but there's limited space so if you're interested and would like to participate please go ahead and book both your lodging and hackathon seat at [EventBrite](http://bit.ly/gcc2014hackreg).

To help organize ideas and people into more concrete projects, we've also set up a [hackathon-specific Trello board](https://trello.com/b/3YgU637b/gcc2014-hackathon) that we'd love for everyone to go ahead and [start using it](https://trello.com/b/3YgU637b/gcc2014-hackathon).  The board is public and open to commentary and voting, but to create new cards you’ll need to be added as a member so please note the instructions on the board for that.

<div class='right'>
<a href='https://curoverse.com/'><img src="/src/images/Logos/CuroversLogoBig.png" alt="Curoverse: Open Source developers of Arvados" width="170" /></a>&nbsp;
<a href='https://arvados.org/'><img src="/src/images/Logos/ArvadosLogoBig.png" alt="Arvados: a free and open source bioinformatics platform for genomic and biomedical data" width="140" /></a>
</div>

Finally, we are very happy to have **[Curoverse](https://curoverse.com/) on board as the exclusive [Peta level sponsor](/src/events/GCC2014/Hackathon/index.md#sponsors)** of the hackathon.  If you know of any other group that might be interested in sponsoring at the [Giga level](/src/events/GCC2014/Hackathon/index.md#sponsors) please let us know.

### Abstracts and Program

The deadlines for both oral and poster presentations were in April.  Oral presentation submitters have been contacted and [we've heard back from over half of them](/src/events/GCC2014/Abstracts/Talks/index.md), and we will continue to update the [Talk Abstracts page](/src/events/GCC2014/Abstracts/Talks/index.md) as we hear from the rest.  If you submitted a poster abstract, they you will be notified at the end of this week if your poster was accepted.  We'll start posting those abstracts online then too.

The conference is still accepting [late abstract submissions](/src/events/GCC2014/Abstracts/index.md).  These will not be considered for constructing the initial list of accepted abstracts, but will be reviewed as cancellations occur and space frees up (*and we have always had a few cancellations*).

Look for a [more detailed draft program](/src/events/GCC2014/Program/index.md) to be posted later this month, once we have heard from all presenters.


### Sponsorships and Exhibitors

<div class='right'>
<a href='http://biolchem.bs.jhmi.edu/'><img src="/src/images/Logos/JohnsHopkinsBioChem.png" alt="Biological Chemistry @ Johns Hopkins" width="260" /></a><br /> 
<a href='http://epigenetics.jhu.edu/'><img src="/src/images/Logos/JohnHopkinsEpigenetics.jpg" alt="Center for Epigenetics" width="260" /></a>
</div>

We are happy to have the [Center for Epigenetics](http://epigenetics.jhu.edu/), and the [Department of Biological Chemistry](http://biolchem.bs.jhmi.edu/), both of Johns Hopkins University as GCC2014 Sponsors. 

There are still [Silver and Bronze sponsorships](/src/events/GCC2014/SponsorExhibit/index.md) available for the [GCC2014](/src/events/GCC2014/index.md) and Giga sponsorships for the [Hackathon](/src/events/GCC2014/Hackathon/index.md). Please contact the [Organizers](/src/events/GCC2014/Organizers/index.md) if your organization would like to help sponsor these events. 

In 2014 we are also adding [non-sponsor exhibit spaces](/src/events/GCC2014/SponsorExhibit/index.md#exhibit) in addition to the sponsor exhibits.  This will significantly increase the size of the exhibit floor. Please contact the [Organizers](/src/events/GCC2014/Organizers/index.md) if your organization would like to have an exhibit space at GCC2014.

A [Galaxy Tour](/src/events/UKMay2014/index.md) is happening in the United Kingdom in early May 2014.  If you are anywhere close to Norwich or Edinburgh, then it might be worth your while to attend an event.

First, there will be a talk on *Scaling Galaxy for Big Data* at the [NGS Data after the Gold Rush](http://www.tgac.ac.uk/SeqAhead_Scientific_Meeting_and_Management_Committee_Meeting/) meeting, being held 6-7 May, at [The Genome Access Centre (TGAC)](http://www.tgac.ac.uk/) in Norwich.  This will be followed by a hands-on *[Introduction to Galaxy Workshop](/src/events/UKMay2014/TGACWorkshop/index.md)* on 9 May, also at TGAC. 

After that, there will be 3 events in Edinburgh the following week, starting on Monday with a hands on *[Introduction to Galaxy Workshop](/src/events/UKMay2014/UEdinburgh/index.md)* at the [University of Edinburgh](http://www.ed.ac.uk/) in the morning and a *Galaxy Project Update* talk at the [5th Edinburgh Bioinformatics Meeting](http://www.bioinformatics.ed.ac.uk/events/5th-edinburgh-bioinformatics-meeting), in the afternoon, and also at the University.  Finally, on Tuesday 13 May, there will be a [all-day hands-on Galaxy Workshop](/src/events/UKMay2014/IGMMWorkshop/index.md) at the [Institute of Genetics and Molecular Medicine (IGMM)](http://www.igmm.ac.uk/) at Western General Hospital.

You must be affiliated with the University of Edinburgh or the IGMM to register for either of those workshops, but all other events are open to anyone.

## Other Events

<div class='right'><a href='http://bit.ly/gxycal'><img src="/src/images/Icons/CalendarIcon.gif" /></a></div> 

And don't worry if you are not near Norwich or Edinburgh in May.  There are [at least 17 other Galaxy related events](/src/events/index.md) in the next 70 days in Norway, France, *online*, Croatia, Thailand, Canada, the US, the Netherlands, and Australia. Also see the [Galaxy Events Google Calendar](http://bit.ly/gxycal) for details on other events of interest to the community.
