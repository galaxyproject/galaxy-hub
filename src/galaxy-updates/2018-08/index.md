## 2019 Galaxy Community Conference: 1-6 July, Freiburg, Germany

[<img  class="img-fluid float-right" style="max-width: 250px" src="/src/events/gcc2019/gcc2019-logo-big.png" alt="GCC2019" />](/src/events/gcc2019/index.md)

**[GCC2019](/src/events/gcc2019/index.md) will be held in Freiburg, Germany, 1-6 July.**  Like [previous Galaxy Community Conferences](/src/gcc/index.md), GCC2019 will feature invited keynotes, accepted talks, posters, and demos, birds-of-a-feather gatherings, multiple days of collaborative work, and plenty of opportunities to network with your fellow data-intensive researchers and practitioners.  If you are working in data-intensive life science, there is no better place to be.

</div>

[Freiburg](https://visit.freiburg.de/en) is on the edge of the Black Forest, and is famous for its architecture, cobblestone streets and historic districts, and is home to one of Germany's oldest universities (and our host)!. Freiburg is in the Baden wine-growing region and *is the sunniest city in Germany.*

GCC2019 will be held at [Konzerthaus Freiburg](http://www.konzerthaus.freiburg.de/) in central Freiburg, adjacent to the [Freiburg train station](https://www.bahnhof.de/bahnhof-de/Freiburg__Breisgau__Hbf-1039062).

GCC2019 is hosted by the [Freiburg Galaxy Project](http://www.bioinf.uni-freiburg.de/Galaxy/), the [University of Freiburg](http://www.uni-freiburg.de/), and [de.NBI (the German Network for Bioinformatics Infrastructure)](https://www.denbi.de/).

### What about BOSC?

2018 was the first time GCC and BOSC held a joint conference.  There is significant overlap between the communities and we had been considering a joint event since at least 2015.  Organizers from both communities felt that GCCBOSC 2018 was a success, and that future joint meetings have even more potential for success.  Not everything went as smoothly as it could have, but we now have a year's experience and a plethora of excellent feedback and suggestions from conference participants. Both the GCC and BOSC organizers feel that we should explore doing this again. 

On the flip side, there are also significant reasons to not *permanently* join the conferences together:  A permanently joint conference risks diluting both communities. GCC also has a different focus from ISMB (BOSC's usual conference partner), and many BOSCers (while still enthused about the GCC partnership) really hesitate to give that up.  Planning a joint conference is also more work than planning a standalone GCC.

**The Decision**

Both sets of organizers, independently and simultaneously (that has to be a good sign :-), decided

1. **Not to hold a joint GCC and BOSC conference in 2019.**
2. **To look into holding a joint meeting every few years, starting as soon as 2020.**

This approach preserves both communities, and has the potential to further increase the synergy between the communities (which was our primary motivating goal in 2018). This also gets BOSC back to ISMB on a regular basis, and helps us avoid some logistical challenges a joint conference would pose in 2019.

A joint meeting in 2020 or 2021 depends on finding a suitable venue (300+ attendees, and more parallel events is just harder) and several other stars aligning, but our aim to bring these communities back together. 

## GTN CoFest on Metagenomics Training Material, 17 August

<img class="img-fluid float-right" style="max-width: 200px;" src="/src/images/galaxy-logos/gtn-cofests.png" alt="GTN cofest logo"/>

The Galaxy Training Network is organizing regular online CoFests (Collaboration/Contribution Fests) every 3 months on the 3rd Friday for a day of the collaborative work on the training content.

**[The first one will be on the 17th of August](/src/events/2018-08-gtn/index.md).** We plan to focus on metagenomics training; but anyone who would like to contribute on any other topics is very welcome to join. We will coordinate via [the GTN Gitter channel](https://gitter.im/Galaxy-Training-Network/Lobby) and [GitHub issues](https://github.com/galaxyproject/training-material/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aopen+sort%3Aupdated-desc+label%3A%22Contribution+fest%22).

# New Galactic Blog Entries

<div class="float-right" >
[<img src="/src/images/galaxy-logos/galactic-blog-400.png" alt="Galactic Blog" width="200" />](/src/blog/index.md)
</div>

There are two new *[Galactic Blog](/src/blog/index.md)* entry:

* [A fruitful year for the Galaxy Training material](/src/blog/2018-06-training-material/index.md), by Bérénice Batut
  * A summary of recent developments in Galaxy Training materials and the Galaxy Training Network
* [Contributor of the Month: Pablo Moreno](/src/blog/2018-08-cotm-pablo-moreno/index.md), By Björn Grüning
  * The first of a monthly series highlighting Galaxy contributors.

# Public Galaxy Server News

There are [over 100 publicly accessible Galaxy servers](/src/use/index.md) and [six semi-public Galaxy services](/src/use/index.md).  Another public server was added in the past quarter:

## ProteoRE

[<img class="float-right" src="/src/use/proteore/proteore.png" alt="ProteoRE" />](http://www.proteore.org/)

"[ProteoRE (Proteomics Research Environment)](http://www.proteore.org/) aims at centrally providing the proteomics community with an online research service enabling biologists/clinicians without programming expertise to **annotate and interpret** their proteomics data through the Web."

ProteoRE currently comprises tools (including graphical display) for:

* Customary data manipulation (e.g. filtering, lists comparison, ID conversion…)
* Protein list annotation (e.g. information retrieval from public resources - human species)
* Functional analysis (e.g. GOterms frequencies, enrichment analysis) including graphical representation.
* Pathway analysis (e.g. Reactome)

This version also includes Galaxy generic tools and some tools from the [GalaxyP project](https://usegalaxyp.org/) that should be of great help for people who want to (re)process their MS-based proteomics data (e.g. peptide/protein identification). [ProteoRE tools are in the Galaxy Toolshed](https://toolshed.g2.bx.psu.edu/view/proteore).

See the [ProteoRE pubic server directory page](/src/use/index.md) for more.
