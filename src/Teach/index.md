This is the *hub page* for information about how to teach bioinformatics using Galaxy, and Galaxy itself.  If you are interested in Galaxy training there are [resources](/src/Teach/Resources/index.md), [trainers](/src/Teach/Trainers/index.md), [compute platform advice](/src/Teach/ComputingPlatforms/index.md), [best practices](/src/Teach/BestPractices/index.md), and the [Galaxy Training Network](/src/Teach/GTN/index.md) are here to help.

## Training Resources Directory

The **[Training Resources Directory](/src/Teach/Resources/index.md)** is a catalog of training resources for Galaxy.  Training resources include tutorials, slides, virtual machines, and entire workshop packages that can be used to teach with Galaxy.

There is also an [easy way to add new resources](/src/Teach/Resources/index.md#add-a-training-resource) to the directory.
