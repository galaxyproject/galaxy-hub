A [Genomic Data Science with Galaxy](https://www.coursera.org/course/gengalaxy) course was launched on the online teaching platform [Coursera](https://www.coursera.org/) in July.  The course is part of the [Genomic Data Science Specialization](https://www.coursera.org/specialization/genomics/41).  A new session starts every month from now through at least the end of 2015.  Coursera courses can be taken for free, or you can pay the course fee and receive a certificate upon completion.

The [video lectures for the Galaxy material is on Vimeo](http://vimeo.com/album/3456144).
