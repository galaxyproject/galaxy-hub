## Needed Tools

The easiest way to use this material is launch the workshop's accompanying Amazon Machine Image (AMI): **ami-ab010aee**.  It has all needed tools already installed on it.  See the [UC Davis Bioinformatics Core Software page](http://bioinformatics.ucdavis.edu/software/) for details.

## Datasets

The workshop AMI (ami-ab010aee) also includes the example datasets used in the exercises.
