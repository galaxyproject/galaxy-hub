[Galaxy 101](https://usegalaxy.org/galaxy101) is a workhorse of basic introduction to Galaxy workshops.  It introduces many of the basics of Galaxy, including the three main panels, commonly used tool kits, using UCSC as a data source, workflows, and pages.  If you are looking for a good basic intro, then look no further.

## Needed Tools

This will run on any Galaxy Server with basic Text Manipulation; Join, Subtract and Group, and Operate on Genomic Intervals toolsets. 

## Datasets

Input datasets are pulled from UCSC, at runtime.  They can also be extracted from the [Galaxy 101 page itself](https://usegalaxy.org/galaxy101).
