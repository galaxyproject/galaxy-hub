<div class="title">Teaching with Galaxy: Materials</div>

INCLUDE(/Teach/LinkBox)

This page links to workshop materials for different topics.  That material can be in this wiki, inside Galaxy instances, or anywhere on the web.


However, right now it's empty.  Until we get something more here, see

* [Learning Galaxy Hub Pages](/Learn)
  * especially the [Other Tutorials](/Learn/#other-tutorials) list
* [Past Events list](/Events/#past-events) and [Events Archive](/Events/Archive), many of which include slides, exercises and other workshop material.
