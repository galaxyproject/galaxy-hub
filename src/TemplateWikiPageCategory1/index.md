## Other wiki guidelines worth considering

If you are starting or editing a new wiki page and want to maximize the chance that it will be included correctly in a *Galaxy Note* and later in our new category system for organizing the wiki content (coming soon!) - please consider the following **wiki guidelines**:

* follow the best practices on our **[Wiki Best Practices](/src/WikiBestPractices/index.md)** and use **Moin Moin**
* start your page using the transition template: **[TemplateWikiPageCategory1](/src/TemplateWikiPageCategory1/index.md)**
* *do not* use spaces in the wiki page name. *do* be specific. *do* use upper/lower case syntax.
* put your images in the right place: **[Images](/src/images/index.md)**
* ***write for a scientific audience*** - ask the question, is your content **Specific and Reproducible?**
  * includes comments/links to support any claims
  * uses proper tool names/versions and links to credit tool authors/publications
  * credits specific data sources and versions with links into Shared Histories/Datasets or external sources
  * anything else that helps whoever may be following along know exactly what is going on 
* be okay with a bit of feedback if you want to have your content included in a note
* send us feedback or edit a wiki if you notice something is wrong or could be misinterpreted, then let us know if it is big so that we can send out a *Galaxy Note* to update the community about the change
* **all feedback is good feedback**
* review/migration process for categories is planned for development in Oct 2012
* patience please while we get this up and going. considered "beta" until at least Nov 2012

<br />
Space is good. Short is good. One topic = one wiki page.
<br />

Want to have your content considered for a *[Galaxy Note](/src/Notes/index.md)*? When your done, email us about it at *outreach at galaxyproject.org* with "Galaxy Note Idea" in the subject line.
* **Important** - this is for **new note suggestions only**. If you have a question about **[Galaxy](/src/FrontPage/index.md)** or a ***Galaxy Note*** or associated content, continue to **send these to one of the [Mailing Lists](/src/MailingLists/index.md)** and just include a link to the Note or wiki.

<br />

*Thanks for using Galaxy!*
