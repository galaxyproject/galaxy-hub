Hey Everyone,

This meeting is open to anyone interested in RNA-Seq analysis and biology workflows.
[Anton Nekrutenko](/anton) of the [Galaxy team](/GalaxyTeam) will be delivering an introduction to RNA-Seq resources available at Galaxy from a practitioner's viewpoint. 

[Galaxy Team members](/GalaxyTeam) will be available for any additional questions.

Thanks and hope to see you there!

#### What is Galaxy and why could it be interesting to me?
Galaxy is a web-based, open source, data integration and analysis platform for life science research. The core pillars of the application are:
* **Accessibility**: enable bench scientists to create bioinformatics analyses
* **Reproducibility**: facilitate computational methods to be completely easily reproducible
* **Transparency**: enable easy sharing and publishing of research data and analyses
A sample instance of the application that is free to use is available at [usegalaxy.org](https://usegalaxy.org/).
Although focused around Galaxy, this workshop is open to anyone interested in the above topics without their specific ties to the application.
