Come meet at one of the Galaxy Project hubs - Penn State University - for general discussions and training about Galaxy in an informal setting. These are open to anyone interested in data analysis, tools, computer infrastructure, programming - regardless if it is introductory or advanced.

# Meetups

* **[May 1, 2015: RNA-Seq Workshop](/src/Events/Meetups/PSU/2015-05/index.md)**
* [March 17, 2015: Initial Meetup](/src/Events/Meetups/PSU/2015-03/index.md)

#### What is Galaxy and why could it be interesting to me?
Galaxy is a web-based, open source, data integration and analysis platform for life science research. The core pillars of the application are:
* **Accessibility**: enable bench scientists to create bioinformatics analyses
* **Reproducibility**: facilitate computational methods to be completely easily reproducible
* **Transparency**: enable easy sharing and publishing of research data and analyses
A sample instance of the application that is free to use is available at [usegalaxy.org](https://usegalaxy.org/).
Although focused around Galaxy, this workshop is open to anyone interested in the above topics without their specific ties to the application.
