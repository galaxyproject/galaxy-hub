## Description

We'll summarize recent efforts to enable Galaxy Main to send jobs to remote HPC resources (XSEDE) and invite others to share related experiences and requirements.  We'll discuss a path to overcome challenges and better meet the needs of the research community. 

## Audience

Anyone (users or admins) interested in leveraging remote or heterogeneous hardware resources with their Galaxy instances.
