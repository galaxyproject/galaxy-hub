## Setting up for success: Everything you need to know when planning for an RNA-seq analysis

This workshop is geared towards researchers who are thinking about conducting an RNA-seq experiment and are interested in knowing more about what is involved. The planning process requires taking a step back to evaluate various factors and ultimately assess the feasibility of the experiment, expecting and avoiding potential pitfalls. 
​
The workshop will go into detail about the different strategies for working with RNA-seq data depending on the biological question on hand:

* Best practice guidelines for experimental design (Biological replicates, Paired-end vs Single-end, Sequencing depth).
* Data storage and computational requirements.
* Overview of commonly used workflows for differential gene expression, de-novo assembly, isoform quantification and other uses of RNA sequencing.


The focus of this workshop is to outline current standards and required resources for the analysis of RNA sequencing data. This workshop will not provide an exhaustive list of software tools or pipelines available; rather it aims to provide a fruitful discussion on how best to prepare for performing RNA-seq data analysis from the lab to manuscript preparation.

**Prerequisites:**

* None

## ChIPseq analysis using deepTools and MACS2

Did my IP work? Where is my signal? How well do my replicates correlate? What might my peaks even look like? Where are my peaks (or signal) in relationship to transcription start sites (or other features)? These are common questions that biologists first pose when dealing with ChIPseq data. We will use deepTools and MACS within Galaxy to demonstrate effective methods of

1. performing ChIPseq-specific quality control,
2. calling peaks and
3. visualising signal and peak enrichment around genes or other features.

We will also touch on aspects of ATAC-seq and techniques such as ribosomal profiling.

**Prerequisites**

- Galaxy 101 or equivalent experience.
- Ideally participants will already be familiar with generic NGS quality control and read mapping, since those won't be covered
- A wi-fi enabled laptop with a modern web browser. Google Chrome, Firefox and Safari will work best.

## Galaxy For Proteogenomics !

Large-scale ‘omics’ data generation is driven by high throughput genome and transcriptome sequencing, and proteome characterization using mass spectrometry. As a result, many researchers are turning to generating integrative analysis of these ‘multi-omics’ datasets given the great potential to provide novel biological insights. These multi-omics applications are particularly challenging for data analysis, as they require the use of multiple, domain-specific software programs on scalable infrastructure capable of handling the computing and storage needs of this large-scale data.

Galaxy has been shown to solve the problems of software integration and scalability for multi-omics analysis, and additionally offer benefits for sharing complete workflows in a user-friendly environment accessible by wet-bench scientists. In this workshop, we will introduce the use of Galaxy platform for multi-omics data analysis applications. As a representative example, we will focus on the maturing field of proteogenomic applications. Proteogenomics most commonly integrates RNA-Seq data, for generating customized protein sequence databases, with mass spectrometry-based proteomics data, which are matched to these databases to identify novel protein sequence variants. (*Cancer Res.* (2017); 77(21):e43-e46. [doi: 10.1158/0008-5472.CAN-17-0331](http://cancerres.aacrjournals.org/content/77/21/e43.long).) 

*Workshop Content:* 

The course will include a basic introduction to proteomics and will include a hands-on session that will cover use of analytical workflows to generate proteomic databases from RNASeq data. The use and understanding of modules for analytical workflows for proteogenomics analysis will be discussed.

*Workshop Schedule:*

* Introduction to multi-omic studies
* RNASeq Data Processing: Generating protein sequence search databases using Galaxy platform
* Hands-on session for proteomics data analysis using Galaxy
* Identification of novel proteoforms and visualization
    
*Workshop Goals:*
    
* Introduce the Galaxy framework as a solution for data analysis across ‘omics’ domains
* Demonstrate use of Galaxy for a proteogenomic analysis (RNA-seq and proteomic integrative analysis)
* Lay the foundation for attendees to implement Galaxy at their own facility or institution to meet ‘omics’ data analysis and informatics needs

**Prerequisites:**

* Users will need laptop for hands-on training

## Small genome de novo assembly using Galaxy

Workshop will cover the basics of de novo genome assembly using a small genome example. This includes project planning steps, selecting fragment sizes, initial assembly of reads into fully covered contigs, and then assembling those contigs into larger scaffolds that may include gaps. The end result will be a set of contigs and scaffolds with sufficient average length to perform further analysis on, including genome annotation. This workshop will use tools and methods targeted at small genomes. The basics of assembly and scaffolding presented here will be useful for building larger genomes, but the specific tools and much of the project planning will be different.

**Prerequisites**

* Galaxy 101
* A wifi enabled laptop with a web browser

and training diverse scientific topics. 

The Galaxy Training Network is a community initiative dedicated to high-quality Galaxy-based
training around the world. One of its objectives is to support trainers with complete training
material and recommendations about bioinformatics training. Templates and best training practices
were defined to help trainers create new material, unify the different material, and make training
materials more accessible and easy for users to learn and for teachers to teach (https://training.galaxyproject.org).

This workshop will introduce participants to the infrastructure of the GTN training materials
and describe how to generate training materials following best practices.
Participants will be introduced to the generation of Galaxy Interactive Tours
and Docker Galaxy flavors dedicated to teaching and training sessions.
The workshop will also cover best practices for running Galaxy-based workshops - how to plan a training session based on number of attendees, time constraints, resource availability, etc.

**Prerequisites**

* Basic familiarity with using Galaxy (how to import datasets and run tools).
* Basic familiarity with git and Docker will also be helpful for parts of the workshop.
* A WiFi-enabled laptop with a modern web browser. Google Chrome or Firefox will work best.

<img class="pull-right" src="/src/images/logos/wdl-logo_white.png" width="95" alt="WDL" />

## WDL, the Workflow Description Language

The advent of open, portable workflow languages is an exciting development which allows for the definition of a workflow to be decoupled from the execution. One can create workflows which can run unmodified on local compute, HPC clusters, or the cloud. As these languages are not tied to a specific execution environment, the descriptions can easily be shared, discovered and even composed together to form more complex workflows. The [Workflow Description Language](http://openwdl.org/) (WDL) is an open, community driven standard that is designed from the ground up as a human-readable and -writable way to express portable tasks and workflows.

In this session we’ll walk through the lifecycle of writing, sharing and discovering portable workflows in WDL. We’ll introduce the WDL syntax. You’ll learn how to write and run a workflow locally. We’ll demonstrate how to use [EPAM’s Pipeline Builder tool](https://github.com/epam/pipeline-builder) to visualize WDL workflows. We’ll look at [Dockstore](https://dockstore.org/), an open platform where one can publish, share and discover workflows. Finally we’ll put everything together and see how we can compose workflows we find on Dockstore together with our own additions to create new, more powerful workflows.

**Prerequisites:**

* Mac or Linux computer
* Java 8 installed and runnable from the command line
* A workshop bundle downloaded from TBD


<img class="pull-right" src="/src/images/logos/bcbio-logo-no-text.png" width="80" alt="bcbio" />

##  Community built analyses that run everywhere with bcbio

**[bcbio](http://bcb.io/)** is community built analyses for germline and somatic
variant calling, RNA-seq, single cell, smallRNA and ChIP-seq. This workshop
will focus on using bcbio to run analysis pipelines in heterogenous
environments -- local machines, HPC, cloud providers and commercial services
(and also hopefully Galaxy). Attendees will learn how to practically run their
analyses on their platform of choice, while discussing how the community can
contribute to building, sharing and maintaining workflows across multiple
platforms. Recent presentations of bcbio show [some of the topics we plan to cover](http://bcbio-nextgen.readthedocs.io/en/latest/contents/presentations.html#presentations).


<img class="pull-right" src="/src/images/logos/cwl-logo-small-trans.png" width="130" alt="CWL" />

## Introduction to Common Workflow Language

Common Workflow Language  (http://commonwl.org) is a standard for writing portable scientific workflows that can execute on a variety of compute environments and workflow systems.

* What is CWL, history
* Status of CWL implementations (Arvados, Toil, Rabix, Galaxy, Cromwell, cwtool, ...)
* Wrapping bioinformatics tools in CWL
* Connecting tools together into workflows
* Best practices for writing portable workflows
* Hands on "bring your own pipeline" session
* Q&A on advanced topics based on audience

**Prerequisites**

* Unix command line experience
* Experience with Docker


<img class="pull-right" src="/src/images/galaxy-logos/cloudlaunch-small-blue.png" width="120" alt="CloudLaunch" />

## Deploying (Galaxy and your) applications into clouds

This tutorial will have two parts. Part 1 will demonstrate how to use the all-new CloudLaunch service to launch and manage instances of Galaxy on the Cloud on multiple cloud providers. In part 2, we will cover the technical process of adding custom applications into CloudLaunch and making them available for launching on any supported cloud (AWS, Azure, GCE, OpenStack). This part will also cover use of the CloudLaunch API, enabling external applications to leverage CloudLaunch capabilities.

**Prerequisites**

* Part 1: a laptop with WiFi and a modern browser
* Part 2: Basic programming skills (Python, Angular 2/4/5 useful but not essential?)


<img class="pull-right" src="/src/images/logos/Conda_480.png" width="95" alt="Conda" />

## Conda and Containers

This workshop is aimed at people with some desire to develop dependencies for tools (either Galaxy or Common Workflow Language (CWL) tools).

We believe the best practice for declaring dependencies for either Galaxy or the CWL is using Conda and Bioconda. Conda is a cross platform package manager that has minimal requirements to use which makes it ideal for HPC. It can also build isolated environments ideal for platforms like Galaxy or CWL implementations. The Bioconda project is a set of Conda recipes for bioinformatics. The BioContainers project builds best practice containers automatically for all Bioconda recipes, so building a BioConda recipe for a package allows the same binaries to be used by both Galaxy (inside or outside a container) and by any conformant CWL implementation.

We will go through the process of creating, testing, and publishing a Bioconda package and we will work through an example of connecting these packages to a real world tool. Participants will be able to work through the examples using either Galaxy or CWL tools.

**Prerequisites**

* Some knowledge of tool development - either CWL or Galaxy.


<img class="pull-right" src="/src/images/galaxy-logos/galaxy_project_logo_square_no_text.png" width="60" alt="Galaxy" />

## Writing & Publishing Galaxy Tools

This session will walk developers and bioinformaticians through the process of taking a working script or application and turning it into a Galaxy tool. It will also cover the basics of using Planemo: a command-line utility to assist in building and publishing Galaxy tools. We will investigate wrapping, common parameters, tool linting, best practices, loading tools into Galaxy, citations, and publishing tools to Github and the Galaxy Tool Shed. Common tips and tricks will be discussed as well as insights from experienced tool developers.

**Prerequisites:**

* A general knowledge of Galaxy (for example, you should be familiar with the material in Galaxy 101 or have attended Introduction to Galaxy).
* Knowledge and comfort with the Unix/Linux command line interface and a text editor. If you don't know what commands like cd, mv, rm, mkdir, chmod, grep can do then you will struggle in this workshop.
* A wi-fi enabled laptop with a modern web browser. Chrome or Firefox will work best.

## Setting up a Galaxy instance as a service

In this workshop, you will learn what is important when you set up a Galaxy server from scratch, what are the pitfalls you might run into, how to interact with the potential users of the service you gonna offer, and how to make sure, the Galaxy instance you have set up is really used in the end. After a general introduction, several Galaxy installations are presented. The session will include some demonstrations and hands-on exercises. We will finish with a panel discussion, where we intend to discuss questions from the workshop participants.

**Prerequisites:**

* Familiar with the Bioinformatics problems (and their solutions) that wet lab scientists run into.
* Knowledge and comfort with the Unix/Linux command line interface and a text editor. If you don't know what cd, mv, rm, mkdir, chmod, grep and so on can do then you will struggle in this workshop.

## Advanced customization of a Galaxy instance

Do you have your lab's Galaxy instance set up and configured but want to give it some more love without diving too deep into the code? This training will show you step by step how to modify some advanced but not complex parts of the installation. We will teach you how to:

* modify the menu
* prepare a custom tour
* adjust the graphical interface
* translate the UI labels to different language
* set up a built-in user/group chat
* write and activate interface webhooks 

**Prerequisites**

* Introduction to Galaxy admin: Setting up a Galaxy instance as a service, or equivalent experience
* Knowledge and comfort with the Unix/Linux command line interface and a text editor. If you don't know what cd, mv, rm, mkdir, chmod, grep and so on can do then you will struggle in this workshop.
* A wi-fi enabled laptop with a modern web browser. Google Chrome, Firefox and Safari will work best.

## Advanced accelerated Galaxy admin

A compressed top level review of the advanced parts of the weeklong Galaxy Administrators Course delivered multiple times in the past 2 years. Given the size of the scope of this topic we will be explaining advanced concepts, pointing out resources and providing guidance, tips, and tricks rather than going through the exercises and into details.

## Administration of Galaxy Infrastructures with Puppet

Administering Galaxy infrastructures can be a daunting task. Configuration management allows one to implement infrastructure using code as opposed to checklists and HowTo guides in order to have reliable installations and the ability to replicate an installation. 

Building off of the work started at the GCC2017 Hackathon, this training will introduce the idea of using puppet for configuration management of systems using existing puppet code and other open source tools available that augment puppet. This session requires no prior experience with puppet or other configuration management tools. 

Draft training materials are [available online](https://github.com/millerjl1701/jedha-temple).

**Prerequisites:**

* You have setup a Galaxy instance before…  maybe.
* Knowledge and comfort with the Unix/Linux command line interface and use of a text editor.
* Vagrant with puppetlabs/centos-7.2-64-nocm box available or a CentOS 7 virtual machine (Infrastructure Server group install)
* **No** Puppet, Chef, or Ansible experience is required.

## Galaxy Interactive Environments

In this session you will get in-depth introduction to Interactive Environments (IE). You will learn how to setup and secure IE’s ([Jupyter](http://jupyter.org/), [RStudio](https://www.rstudio.com/), etc.) in a production Galaxy instance. Moreover, we will create an IE on-the-fly to get you started in creating your own Interactive Environments.In this session you will get an introduction to Interactive Environments (IE) as an easy and powerful way to integrate arbitrary interactive web services into Galaxy. We will demonstrate the [IPython Galaxy Project](https://github.com/bgruening/galaxy-ipython) and the general concept of IE’s.

**Prerequisites:**

* Basic understanding of Galaxy from a developer point of view.
* General knowledge about Docker
* Knowledge and comfort with the Unix/Linux command line interface and a text editor. If you don't know what cd, mv, rm, mkdir, chmod, grep and so on can do then you will struggle in this workshop.
* A wi-fi enabled laptop with a modern web browser.  Google Chrome, Firefox and Safari will work best.

## Adding Galaxy Workflows to a Tripal Website

Learn to integrate two popular and widely adopted open source [GMOD](https://gmod.org/) tools: [Tripal](https://tripal.info/), a content management system for building community genome websites, and Galaxy, a web-based workflow engine for biological data analysis. The new Tripal-to-Galaxy bridge allows users of community databases to select pre-designed workflows for common analyses and upload their own data or utilize site data as input. We will also use new R Markdown wrapped Galaxy tools (Aurora Galaxy Tools) to construct HTML reports summarizing and visualizing the workflow output.

**Prerequisites**

* Familiarity with Galaxy user interface and basic Galaxy server administration.

## The Galaxy Docker Project

In this session you will learn the internals of the Docker Galaxy Image.
We will show you tips and tricks on how to run the Galaxy Docker Image successfully in production,
how to manage updates and how to bind the container to a cluster scheduler.
Moreover, you will learn how to create your own Galaxy flavour mixing a variety of different tools and visualisations.
A composed Galaxy setup will be demonstrated and you will learn how you can orchestrate Galaxy to dynamically scale
with rising user demand.

**Prerequisites**

* Basic understanding of Galaxy from an admin point of view
* General knowledge about Docker
* Familiarity with Unix command line

## The Galaxy Database Schema

Running a production Galaxy server, you some times end up in a situation, where you manually need to interact with the database, e.g. you want to extract usage information, which can not be gathered from the built in reports tool. Or, a more  risky adventure: you need to change the state of a job to 'error'. For both cases, you require a good understanding of the Galaxy database schema. In this training session, you will learn some of the design concepts of the database, and how to extract (or if necessary change) information useful for a Galaxy admin.

**Prerequisites**

* Experience maintaining a production Galaxy server
* Basic knowledge of relational databases and SQL statements
