{{> Events/GCCBOSC2018/Header }}


The joint [2018 Bioinformatics Open Source and Galaxy Community Conferences](https://gccbosc2018.sched.com/) start with [two days of training](https://gccbosc2018.sched.com/overview/type/C.x+Training+-+All). The training topics were nominated by and then voted on by our communities.

[GCCBOSC2018](https://gccbosc2018.sched.com/) will be held 25-30 June in Portland, Oregon, United States.  The [first day of training](https://gccbosc2018.sched.com/2018-06-25/overview/) is focused on Galaxy and offers two introductory tracks, one for researchers analyzing their data, and one for Galaxy admins.

The [second day of training](https://gccbosc2018.sched.com/2018-06-26/overview/) features five tracks covering a breadth of topics of interest to the BOSC and Galaxy communities.
