This page describes the **!GalaxyScientists** [Birds of a Feather](/Events/GCC2015/BoFs) Meetup held at [GCC2015](http://gcc2015.tsl.ac.uk/). Don't worry if you don't know what this group is .. the BoF is intended to define and create it! 

<br />
## Description

Meetup of Galaxy Scientists and Analysts that will discuss strategies for communicating the "Voice of the Scientist" as a formal, decided, recognised, action orientated feedback group into Galaxy development priorities. Produce a group description, meeting plan, goals, non-goals, and overall purpose to present to the Galaxy Team for consideration to create the group as a new community-based feedback resource from the analysis and end-user perspective.

## Audience

Galaxy Scientists interested in getting organised and contributing as to how Galaxy evolves. A dedicated group of team & community members that will provide a "scientific voice" to augment, guide, and offer feedback into Galaxy development efforts.
<br />
<br />
In addition, if you joined in on this year's [Data Wrangling Hackathon](http://gcc2015.tsl.ac.uk/data-hackathon/) (or wanted to but were unable), YOU want to BE HERE.

## When and Where

The [time and location](/src/Events/GCC2015/BoFs/index.md#bof-schedule) for this BoF is Tuesday, July 7th, over lunch at 12:30pm in the Franklin Room, JICCC

## Focus

Form the group! Please reserve discussion topics to those that directly concern the core targets. 

Heads up [/GalaxyAdmins](/GalaxyAdmins), please join us! A primary target goal is to complement the input your community group provides to Galaxy. We'd love your help in determining optimal organizational strategies.

## Ideas
Add these before the BoF to aid in focusing our discussion. We'll create a [https://wiki.galaxyproject.org/GalaxyScientists](https://wiki.galaxyproject.org/GalaxyScientists) group wiki during and migrate Ideas and Resolutions content there.
* Create the community group "!GalaxyScientists" ??
* **Publish a group wiki: [https://wiki.galaxyproject.org/GalaxyScientists](https://wiki.galaxyproject.org/GalaxyScientists)**
* Who?
* Why?
* Feedback route(s)?
* New moderated Twitter account @galaxyscientists?? Open to all core group members?
* **Start organizing the group logistics. Meetings, communications, and such.**
* Waaaay more .. what do you THINK?

## Resolutions / Discussion

**Purpose:** Discuss whether a Galaxy end-user group would be useful to the rest of the community and if so, kick start the group.

**Decision:** Yes

### Two tenets for the Galaxy Scientists Community

The Galaxy Scientists Community represents Galaxy end-users and gives them a voice to interact with the core team. However, **the activities of the Galaxy Scientists Community shall not interfere with core team activities, priorities, and current user support, or feedback loops. **

The Galaxy Scientists may or may not include support, training, faq projects (bundling of existing resources, creating new ones, all in a centralized location), **but should not interfere with [Galaxy Training Network](/src/Teach/GTN/index.md).**


### Action Items:
1. **Establish formal name**
    Galaxy Scientists
1. **Leadership roles**  
    First term (duration of term was not defined, likely to be about 1 year) representatives
    * Maria Doyle, Peter !MacCallum Cancer Centre, Melbourne, Australia 
    * Frederik Coppens, VIB Gent, Belgium
1. **Recognition** by GalaxyProject.org
1. **Email list or forum** for discussion of end-user topics. NOT “how to”, but rather defining strategies and/or suggestions to improve the end-user experience
1. **Electronic communications:** google drive docs, alternates 
1. **Meetings:** method, format, frequency
  1. meetings could be held via Google hangouts or equivalent video conferences
  1. meetings at GCC
  1. potential meetings of local subgroups

### Long Term Goals

To start with, a set of initial long term goals was defined. These goals may be extended, adapted, or dropped after Galaxy Scientists has been going for a certain time.

1. **Collection of usage metrics**
    Initially based on pre-existing user groups across various institutions, the collection process is expected to capture data about how Galaxy is used by the wider end-user community in order to give the Galaxy Scientists a voice backed up by community needs and not by individual preferences.
1. **End-User Feedback **
    Establish a prioritized list of the likes, challenges, wish-list items, analysis needs, or gaps of the end-user community.
1. **Communication and Collaboration**
    Members offer support and/or work directly with tool developers on projects (e.g. the IUC). <br />
    Examples: 
    1. define and share how important a tool/feature is to the user-community to aid in prioritization
    1. test/review a tool/function so that is is presented optimally in the UI based on how end-users work within Galaxy
    1. pairing scientists and software engineers on new development so that both can leverage their area(s) of expertise
1. **Community**
    Creating a place where end-users can discuss how they are using Galaxy with other data scientists outside of Q&A forums (or maybe within existing forums, but in a different space - Biostars has a forum area that may be appropriate, or a google group could be a better choice - nothing has been decided, yet)
