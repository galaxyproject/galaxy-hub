The first ever **Galaxy Project Admin Training workshop** will be held November 7-11 in [Salt Lake City](http://www.visitsaltlake.com/), Utah.  

Basic and Advanced Topics sessions will be offered and participants can [register](/src/Events/AdminTraining2016/Registration/index.md) for one or both.  Sessions will be intensive and hands-on, and taught by experienced instructors from the Galaxy Project Team.  Participants will learn how to install, configure, customize, and extend their own Galaxy servers.  Topics include tool configuration, authentication and user management, using heterogeneous storage and compute services, and many other topics that will enable you to get your own Galaxy server up and running, performing well, and used by your community.

Galaxy is an open web based platform for biomedical data integration and analysis.  It is deployed at large and small organizations around the world and used in a broad range of biomedical research domains, and across the tree of life.

Training will take place the week before [Supercomputing'16 (SC16)](http://sc16.supercomputing.org/) meets in Salt Lake.
