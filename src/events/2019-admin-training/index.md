**[Galaxy Admin Training](https://github.com/galaxyproject/dagobah-training)** will be offered January 28 through February 1 at Penn State University, where the Galaxy Project got started over ten years ago.  The workshop is split into a [2 day introductory session](https://github.com/galaxyproject/dagobah-training#basic-sessions) and a [3 day advanced topics session](https://github.com/galaxyproject/dagobah-training#advanced-sessions).  Participants can register for one or both sessions.

This workshop will cover [basic](https://github.com/galaxyproject/dagobah-training#basic-sessions) and [advanced topics](https://github.com/galaxyproject/dagobah-training#advanced-sessions) you need to know to set up your own production, high-performance and multi-user Galaxy instance.  Sessions will be *intensive and hands-on*, and taught by experienced instructors from the Galaxy Community. Participants will learn how to install, configure, customize, and extend their own Galaxy servers. Topics include tool configuration, authentication and user management, using heterogeneous storage and compute services, and many other topics that will enable you to get your own Galaxy server up and running, performing well, and used by your community.

Galaxy is an open web based platform for biomedical data integration and analysis. It is deployed at large and small organizations around the world and used in a broad range of biomedical research domains, and across the tree of life.

# Schedule

The [workshop](https://github.com/galaxyproject/dagobah-training) is split into a [2 day introductory session](https://github.com/galaxyproject/dagobah-training#basic-sessions) and a [3 day advanced topics session](https://github.com/galaxyproject/dagobah-training#advanced-sessions).

# Prerequisites

**Please review the prerequisites carefully before registering.**  If you arrive without meeting the prerequisites then the workshop will be a frustrating experience.

## Introduction Session

### Comfortable with the Unix/Linux command line

Most of the workshop will happen at the Linux command line.  *If you aren’t comfortable with this before you arrive, then you will be lost the entire time.*  How comfortable do you need to be?  Here’s a sampling of commands and concepts that you should be comfortable with:
  ```
cd, mkdir, rmdir, ls
tar, gzip
cp, mv, rm, chmod, ln 
~, .., ./, /tmp,
cat, tail, less
man
```

Note: *This is not an exhaustive list (or even a proper subset) of the commands that will be used in the workshop.*  They are included here to give you an idea of the depth of knowledge that is required.

### Competent in a Unix/Linux text editor

Linux has several text editors available in it.  You’ll need to be competent in at least one of them before the workshop starts.  Organizers will make sure that these editors are available on the Linux images we use in the workshop:

* [Nano](https://www.nano-editor.org/): Simple and functional.  Gets the job done.
* [Emacs](https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/): Powerful and a wee bit scary.
* [VIM](http://www.vim.org/): Powerful, efficient, and more than a wee bit scary.

### Some experience with Linux Package Management

You don’t need to be an expert at Linux package management, but you do need to have some experience at installing and upgrading packages on a Linux system.

We’ll be using Ubuntu based images during the workshop, which means we’ll be using **[apt](https://help.ubuntu.com/community/AptGet/Howto)** to do package management.  Get to know it.

## Advanced Topics 

Prerequisites include all of the Introduction Session prerequisites, plus familiarity with the topics presented in that session.

# Laptop Requirements

All participants should bring a wifi-enabled laptop with 

* at least 4GB of memory (more is better)
* Software to access the command line of a Linux server.
  * If you are running Linux or Mac OS, then you already have this.
  * If you are running Windows than you’ll need to get something like putty installed before the workshop.
* A recent version of either the Chrome or Firefox web browser installed.

# Instructors

We currently have five confirmed (and highly experienced!) instructors:

* [Martin Čech](/src/people/marten/index.md), software engineer for the Galaxy Project and frequent sys admin for usegalaxy.org.
* [Nate Coraor](/src/people/nate/index.md), lead sysadmin of Galaxy Main (https://usegalaxy.org) and a software engineer for the Galaxy Project
* [John Chilton](/src/people/john-chilton/), software engineer for the Galaxy Project working on both the front and back ends, with an emphasis on scalability.
* [Simon Gladman](https://github.com/Slugger70), administrator of Galaxy Australia (https://usegalaxy.org.au), University of Melbourne
* [Helena Rasche](https://github.com/erasche), lead sysadmin of Galaxy Europe (https://usegalaxy.eu), software engineer and cloud administrator for University of Freiburg/de.NBI Project Freiburg branch

# Transportation

The easiest way to get to Penn State is the [State College Airport (SCE)](https://www.universityparkairport.com/).  SCE is served by [American, Delta, and United airlines](https://www.universityparkairport.com/arrivals-and-departures/our-airlines/) and has multiple daily direct connections to Chicago, Detroit, Philadelphia, and Washington Dulles.  SCE is less than a 15 minute ride from downtown State College.

Major international airports within a 4 hour drive of State College include Baltimore (BWI), Philadelphia (PHL), Pittsuburgh (PIT) - all ~ 3 hours; and Washington National (DCA) and Washington DULLES (IAD) both ~ 3.5 hours.  Philadelphia and Pittsburgh have reasonable public transportation to State College (under 6 hours), but everywhere else you will definitely want to rent a car.

# Lodging

There is no official lodging venue for this event.  However, here are several places to consider:

* [Days Inn](https://www.wyndhamhotels.com/days-inn/state-college-pennsylvania/days-inn-penn-state/overview), in the State College city center.  Close to restaurants, pubs and shopping, and a 14 minute walk to the workshop.
* [Hyatt Place](https://statecollege.place.hyatt.com/), also in central State College, and a 16 minute walk.
* [Nittany Lion Inn](https://nittanylioninn.psu.edu/), on the Penn State campus, and is an 18 minute walk to the workshop venue.
* [Atherton Hotel](https://www.athertonhotel.net/), in central State College and an 18 minute walk.

There are other less expensive, but more distant lodging options.  State College has a [public bus system](http://www.catabus.com/ServiceSchedules/CATABUS/index.html) (*every* route goes close to or through campus) and [paid public parking is available on campus](https://transportation.psu.edu/hub-parking-deck) as well.
