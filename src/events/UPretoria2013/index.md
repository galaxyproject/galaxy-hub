## Apply

The [African Centre for Gene Technologies](http://www.acgt.co.za/) in collaboration with the [University of Pretoria’s IRT for Genomics](http://web.up.ac.za/default.asp?ipkCategoryID=19419) will host this workshop at no cost to researchers who require training in NGS data analysis. The workshop is open to all researchers. Admission is competitive and will be based on the strength of your application. 

Each applicant is required to submit a detailed motivation outlining how the course will contribute to their current research. Preference will be given to those who have already generated data which requires further analysis.  

*Applications should be submitted by the 17<sup>th</sup> of September 2013.* Applications that are late or incomplete will not be considered. All applicants will be notified as to the outcome of their application by the 27<sup>th</sup> September 2013. 

## Audience

Are you a life scientist who needs to do complex analysis on large datasets?

Galaxy is an open, web-based platform for data intensive life science research that enables non-bioinformaticians to create, run, tune, and share their own bioinformatic analyses.

This hands-on workshop will teach participants how to integrate data, and perform simple and complex analysis within Galaxy.  It will also cover data visualization and visual analytics, and how to share and reuse your bioinformatic analyses, all from within Galaxy.

No programming or Linux command line experience is required.

## Content

**Monday through Thursday are aimed at biologists, while Friday is aimed at computer scientists.**

<div class='indent'>

*Please note that all successful applicants (with the exception of the computer scientists) are required to attend the course from Monday to Thursday. This is non-negotiable due to the limited number of spaces available.

While day 5 (Friday) is aimed at the computer scientist, biologists attending the course are encouraged to attend the sessions on Friday. If you wish to attend the session on Friday, please indicate so when [prompted during the application process](https://www.surveymonkey.com/s/GalaxyOCT13PTA).

Computer scientists wishing to attend the course on Friday also need to follow the [application process](https://www.surveymonkey.com/s/GalaxyOCT13PTA).*

*This agenda is tentative and should be considered a work in progress.*
