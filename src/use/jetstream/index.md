comments:
  - 'You need to be eligible for an [XSEDE allocation](https://portal.xsede.org/allocation-policies) to use Jetstream, which means must be based at a U.S. institution. And although XSEDE is NSF-funded, "projects need not be supported by NSF grants" to receive an allocation.'
  - "Jetstream enables researchers to launch, use, and shutdown their own Galaxy servers that have been pre-configured similar to the [Main Galaxy server](https://usegalaxy.org/). If you want to further customize your launched server you can [become an administrator](/src/cloud/jetstream/ssh/index.md#adding_galaxy_admin_user) and even [access the server from the shell](/src/cloud/jetstream/ssh/index.md)."
user_support:
  - "See the [Galaxy on Jetstream documentation](/src/cloud/jetstream/index.md)"
  - "[FAQ](/src/cloud/jetstream/faq/index.md)"
quotas:
  - "Limits are determined by the size of your allocation and the size of the instances you launch."
