comments:
  - "The web portal is termed ARIES (Advanced Research Infrastructure for Experimentation in genomicS). Aims:"
  - "Development of an Information System for the collection of genomic and epidemiological data to enable the Next Generation Sequencing (NGS)-based surveillance of infectious epidemics, foodborne outbreaks and diseases at the animal-human interface."
  - "Development of analytical pipelines enabling harmonized, real time multi-genome comparisons, to improve the detection of clusters of cases of infections and allowing the global bio-tracing of pathogens."
  - "Development of metagenomics models for the culture-independent detection and typing of pathogens and the study of their interactions with the microbiota in human and animal samples and in the vehicles of infections."

  - "The system can be rebooted any time for service purposes,
although generally a warning will be published with some advance on the ARIES site and through the [@ARIES_ GENOMICS](https://twitter.com/ARIES_GENOMICS) Twitter account."
  - "No backup of data is performed on our servers"
