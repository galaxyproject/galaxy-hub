Hello all,

The Galaxy Community Conference has been held annually since 2010.  [This year's event (GCC2015)](http://gcc2015.tsl.ac.uk/) is being hosted by [The Sainsbury Lab](http://tsl.ac.uk/) in Norwich, UK.  
**We are now seeking proposals from any organization interested in hosting GCC2016.**


GCC draws 200+ participants from data-intensive life science research.  Participants come from around the world, from all career stages, and do research spanning the tree of life.  Universities, hospitals and medical schools, research organizations, and industry are all represented, including the largest and most influential organizations in the world.  

What do we need to host GCC, you ask?  In approximately decreasing order of importance:
* **Enthusiasm to plan and organize a 3+ day event for more than 200 people.**
* Space for 4-6 parallel Training Day sessions, each able to accommodate from 25 to 75 participants.
* Central meeting space with capacity for 250-300 people.
* Affordability (or access to sponsorship funds; there's a reason we've always held GCC in academic settings)
* Nearby space for breakouts, poster sessions and sponsors.
* Nearby space for lunch, coffee breaks.
* Good wifi for all events (that's 200+ people and their devices).
* Space for a hackathon for 2 days before the event.
* Easy to get to by air, from within the States, and from overseas
* Nearby, affordable housing, or easy walking distance or easy public transport from lodging options to conference facilities
* Close proximity to a pub and other social hubs.

Hosts get copious (and enthusiastic) organizational support from Galaxy's Outreach Team (who have been helping to organize GCC since 2011), and even more copious gratitude (even *adulation!)* from the Galaxy Community.  If you are interested in possibly hosting GCC2016 next summer then please contact [Galaxy Outreach](mailto:outreach@galaxyproject.org).  Our goal is to announce the site at this year's conference in July.

Hoping to work with you in 2016!
