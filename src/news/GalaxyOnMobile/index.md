**Galaxy is now accessible from your [IOS](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/galaxy-portal/id937158087?mt=8) and [Android](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=no.uio.bmi.claus) devices.** The Galaxy Portal app is a quick and easy way to monitor the status of biomedical research on any Galaxy server. With this app you can set up a list of Galaxy connections and browse your analyses histories in a user-friendly format and take a peek at your data on the go.

The app has been in development for over a year at the University of Oslo as part of [Claus Børnich's masters thesis](https://www.duo.uio.no/handle/10852/44701) and is described in
