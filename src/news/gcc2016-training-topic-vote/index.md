The [2016 Galaxy Community Conference (GCC2016)](/src/events/gcc2016/index.md) will be held June 25-29 at [Indiana University](http://indiana.edu) in Bloomington, Indiana, United States. GCC2016 features [two full days of training on June 26-27](/src/events/gcc2016/training/index.md).  Each day will have multiple tracks, with each track featuring several sessions throughout the day.

Workshops will be hands-on and participants will be strongly encouraged to bring a laptop and follow along.

If you work in data-intensive biomedical research, there is no better place than GCC2016 to present your work and to learn from others.

As always, please let us know if you have any questions.

Thanks,

The [GCC2016 Exec](https://gcc2016.iu.edu/Oorganizers)
