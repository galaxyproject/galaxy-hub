The [GalaxyAdmins group](/Community/GalaxyAdmins) is coming up on it's one year anniversary and this is a good time to discuss where the group should go moving forward.  See the [GalaxyAdmins Future Directions page](/Community/GalaxyAdmins/Future) for a summary of issues, including:

* [Goals and Activities](/Community/GalaxyAdmins/Future#galaxyadmins-goals-and-activities)
* [Leadership Models and Selection](/Community/GalaxyAdmins/Future#leadership)
* and a summary of the [group's history](/Community/GalaxyAdmins/Future#history).

These topics are currently being discussed in [/this email thread](/this email thread).  Whatever consensus and plan we reach will be posted to the [wiki page](/Community/GalaxyAdmins/Future).  Ideally we should have a plan of action in place before [GCC2103](/Events/GCC2013) at the end of June.
