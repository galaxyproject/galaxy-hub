A [Conference Report](/Events/GAW2014/#conference-report) for the first [Galaxy Australasia Workshop](/Events/GAW2014) is now [available](/Events/GAW2014/#conference-report).  Most of the [slides and posters](/Events/GAW2014/#program) are also [available](/Events/GAW2014/#program).

The first [Galaxy Australasia Workshop (GAW 2014)](/Events/GAW2014) was held on Monday 24th and Tuesday 25th March. Conference venues and catering were provided by [CSIRO](http://csiro.au/) (Australia's national science agency) so attendance was *free*.

The event featured more that twenty keynotes, accepted presentations, posters, tutorials, and panel discussions.  The event was attended by over forty people from over twenty organizations and at least three continents.  See the [Conference Report](/Events/GAW2014/#conference-report) for full details.
