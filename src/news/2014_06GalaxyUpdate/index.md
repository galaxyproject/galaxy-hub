The [June 2014 Galaxy Update Newsletter](/GalaxyUpdates/2014_06) is out!  There's a lot going on in the project and the community right now.  The big news for the coming month is
 
* **[GCC2014 registration closes June 6!](/GalaxyUpdates/2014_06#gcc2014-june-30---july-2-baltimore)**
    (OK, that's a lie, but after June 6, late registration rates kick in, and you don't want to pay those.)
  * **[GCC2014 starts June 30](/GalaxyUpdates/2014_06#gcc2014-june-30---july-2-baltimore)!**
  * **The first ever [GCC Hackathon starts June 28](/GalaxyUpdates/2014_06#galaxy-hackathon-at-gcc2014)!**
* After a very long and productive life, the [Galaxy-User mailing list is retiring on June 6](/GalaxyUpdates/2014_06#galaxy-user-being-retired-june-6).  (Don't worry. [It's been replaced by Galaxy Biostar](/GalaxyUpdates/2014_06#galaxy-user-being-retired-june-6).)

[There are also at least 14 other Galaxy related events](/GalaxyUpdates/2014_06#other-events) in the next two months in Thailand, Canada, France, the United States, Italy, the Netherlands, Australia, and Brazil.

And, in the past month there were:

* [49 new papers](/GalaxyUpdates/2014_06#new-papers)
* [One new public server (deepTools)](/GalaxyUpdates/2014_06#new-public-servers)
* [One new Galaxy deployment description (deepTools)](/GalaxyUpdates/2014_06#galaxy-community-hubs)
* and [a stunning number of ToolShed contributions](/GalaxyUpdates/2014_06#toolshed-contributions)
