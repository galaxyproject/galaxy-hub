<div class='newsItemHeader'>[2014 Galaxy Questionnaires](/src/news/2014Questionnaire/index.md)</div>

The Galaxy Project is preparing for our next grant cycle and we are seeking your feedback and comments on on all things Galaxy.  We have created two questionnaires, each focused on how you interact with Galaxy:
**
1. [Galaxy User Questionnaire](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/1NT3ma2g7rR-mWA_vgOg2Ia_6VTFiZ86um2JhX2SecCk/formResponse)
1. [Galaxy Admin, Tool Developer, and Galaxy Developer Questionnaire](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/1lszXJ2lDJ2dYCWKXBk1qT1jO7XdDDfxXmGRCUMZFX2U/viewform)

**

Please take a few minutes and fill out whichever surveys apply to you.  The questionnaires are structured so you can skip topics that don't apply to you, and every question is optional.

*And, to thank you for your time and effort, the Galaxy Project will increase your storage quota on [usegalaxy.org](https://usegalaxy.org) by 50GB, a 20% increase.*

Let your voice be heard!
