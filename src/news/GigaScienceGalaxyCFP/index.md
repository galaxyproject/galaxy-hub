The [2013 Galaxy Community Conference (GCC2013)](/Events/GCC2013) and [BioMed Central](http://www.biomedcentral.com/) are announcing a special thematic series in *[GigaScience](http://www.gigasciencejournal.com/)*, a new journal co-published in collaboration between [BGI Shenzhen](http://www.genomics.cn/en/index) and [BioMed Central](http://www.biomedcentral.com/) focused on studies utilizing large-scale datasets and workflows. [Galaxy](http://galaxyproject.org) is an open, web-based platform for data intensive biomedical research allowing their growing community of users to reproduce and share analyses. All accepted oral presentations from the meeting will be eligible for consideration in the series, and working with the [scientific committee](/Events/GCC2013/Organizers/#scientific_committee), peer review will be coordinated, thorough and timely. BGI has been generously covering the open-access [article-processing charges](http://www.gigasciencejournal.com/about/apcfaq) for the journal’s launch, and this offer will be extended to all submissions from the 2013 conference.

Covering the themes of the conference, discussion and research is considered highlighting best practice for local Galaxy installation, management and use, as well as interesting tools, data sources, or novel uses of Galaxy. Addressing many of the goals of Galaxy to enable more accessible, reproducible, and transparent genomic science, submissions can utilize a novel format, where all of the workflows, tools and supporting data can be hosted and integrated into accepted papers using independently citable [digital object identifiers](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Digital_object_identifier) from the journal's [Giga-Galaxy server](http://galaxy.cbiit.cuhk.edu.hk/) and [GigaDB database](http://gigadb.org/).

Please contact the [gcc2013-sci@galaxyproject.org](conference organizers) or [editorial@gigasciencejournal.com](GigaScience editors) for further information, or submit a [manuscript](http://www.gigasciencejournal.com/authors/instructions/research) or [conference abstract](/Events/GCC2013/Abstracts), mentioning you would like to be considered in the series. The deadline for consideration for oral presentations to the meeting is 12<sup>th</sup> April, but later submissions for exceptional poster presentations (deadline 3<sup>rd</sup> May) and related work utilizing Galaxy may also be considered for the [open series](http://www.gigasciencejournal.com/series).
