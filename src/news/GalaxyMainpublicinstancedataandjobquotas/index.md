### Dear Galaxy User
**Thank you *very much*** for using our *free and open* public resource. **[Galaxy](http://usegalaxy.org) has become extremely popular** and as a result many people rely on it daily for their analysis needs. Previously our service had no restrictions on usage, which is not sustainable in the long term. *To continue providing our open service in a **fair manner***, we are now implementing **quotas at the public Galaxy Main instance** http://usegalaxy.org (http://main.g2.bx.psu.edu).
### Thanks for using Galaxy!
### The details, including administrative:
* **Galaxy Main Wiki** http://galaxyproject.org/wiki/Main
* **Data management: accounting and disk quotas** http://galaxyproject.org/wiki/Admin/Disk%20Quotas
* **Managing Datasets in Galaxy** http://galaxyproject.org/wiki/Learn/Managing%20Datasets#Actions

<table>
  <tr>
    <th colspan=2> Quotas on Main </th>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <th> Maximum total user data on server: </th>
    <td> 250GB for registered users<br />5GB for unregistered users </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <th> Maximum concurrent jobs: </th>
    <td> 8 or less for registered/unregistered users </td>
  </tr>
</table>

<br />
For those users with current account disk usage over the quota limit, we will be implementing a step-down program over the next several weeks. Details for that program will be emailed to those users directly.
