**The Galaxy Team Selects [BioTeam](http://bioteam.net)<sup>TM</sup> as the Official Provider of Appliances to Accelerate Biomedical Research**

[BioTeam](http://bioteam.net) announced that they have formed a strategic alliance with the Galaxy Project to build and offer the [SlipStream Appliance: Galaxy Edition](http://www.bioteam.net/slipstream/galaxy-edition) – a high-performance, server class device pre-loaded with a fully operational Galaxy analysis platform.  This affordable appliance is designed to handle computationally intensive data analysis and, because it is a plug-and-play solution, lowers the barrier for entry into data analysis for IT-constrained researchers and laboratories.  The appliance is intended to make Galaxy more accessible by relieving some of the burdens users may experience with other methods of accessing the platform.  For example, due to the overwhelming demand, “Galaxy Main can no longer meet the community’s needs,” said James Taylor, one of the Galaxy Project founders. “Analysis needs to be decentralized, and one great way to do this is by having local Galaxy instances…Unfortunately, this presents barriers for many groups … !BioTeam’s pre-built appliance eliminates all of these barriers, allowing research groups to run their own local Galaxy with minimal effort.”
