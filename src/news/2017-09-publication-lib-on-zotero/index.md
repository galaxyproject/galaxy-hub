After residing on CiteULike since 2011, the [Galaxy Publication Library](/src/publication-library/index.md) has moved to [Zotero](https://www.zotero.org/). The [library](https://www.zotero.org/groups/galaxy) lists published articles, conference proceedings, theses, book chapters and books that use, extend, reference or implement Galaxy. You can [search the library at Zotero](https://www.zotero.org/groups/1732893/galaxy/items), or through the [unified Galaxy search](/src/search/index.md) (results are in the *Corpus* tab - *but not yet* - give Google a few days to catch up).

Publications are tagged with the same [set of 17 tags](/src/publication-library/index.md#tags) we've been using for years.  However, there are lots of other changes in tagging.  First, those 17 tags now all start with "+" to distinguish them from the new server and content tags.

**Highlighted Pubs**

Two tags were added to highlight pubs that particularly focus on Galaxy.

| Tag | Explanation |
| --- | --- |
| **[+Galactic](https://www.zotero.org/groups/galaxy/items/tag/+Galactic/)** | Publication is about Galaxy. |
| **[+Stellar](https://www.zotero.org/groups/galaxy/items/tag/+Stellar/)** | Publication features Galaxy prominently. |

**Public Server Tags**

Starting with the papers added this month (over 100 of them): Publications that mention or use a [public Galaxy server](/src/use/index.md) or [service](/src/use/index.md) are tagged with the server's name, preceded by a ">".  For example, the [>RepeatExplorer](https://www.zotero.org/groups/1732893/galaxy/items/tag/%3ERepeatExplorer) tag lists all papers that use or reference the RepeatExplorer public server.

**Content / domain tags**

Also starting with papers added this month, we are including tags provided by publishers about the publication's contents.  These tags are not preceded with a "+" or ">" and they aren't rationalized in any way. They come straight from the publishers.

**Want to help?**

Finally, Zotero is a community platform.  If you are interested in helping to catalog papers then please see the [contributing page](/src/publication-library/contribute/index.md).

Thanks for using (and [mentioning and referencing](/src/citing-galaxy/index.md) :-) Galaxy,
