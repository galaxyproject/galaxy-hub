<div class='right'><a href='http://gcc2015.tsl.ac.uk/registration/'><img src='/Images/Logos/GCC2015LogoWide600.png' alt='GCC2015 Registration is open' width="220" /></a></div>

We are tremendously pleased (and more than a little relieved) to announce that **[registration for GCC2015 is now open](http://gcc2015.tsl.ac.uk/registration/)**.  The [2015 Galaxy Community Conference](http://gcc2015.tsl.ac.uk/) includes [2 days of hackathons, 2 days of training, and a two day meeting](http://gcc2015.tsl.ac.uk/programme/) featuring accepted presentations, keynotes, poster sessions, lightning talks, birds-of-a-feather meetups, and plenty of networking.  GCC2015 is hosted by [The Sainsbury Laboratory](http://www.tsl.ac.uk/), in Norwich, UK, and events run 4-8 July.

[Registration costs](http://gcc2015.tsl.ac.uk/registration/) depend on [which events you register for](http://gcc2015.tsl.ac.uk/programme/), [your career stage/affiliation](http://gcc2015.tsl.ac.uk/registration/), and [when you register](http://gcc2015.tsl.ac.uk/registration/) *(register by 22 May - really, it will save you plenty).*  Early bird registration starts at less than £40 / day for students and postdocs, and at £55 / day for other attendees from non-profits.

You can also sign up for [conference housing](http://gcc2015.tsl.ac.uk/logistics/#Lodging) during (and only during) registration.

We apologize profusely for the delay in opening registration, and we thank you for your patience and faith.  We promise the conference will again [be spectacular](/src/GalaxyProject/Statistics/index.md#events).

[Dave Clements](/DaveClements) and [Martin Page](http://www.tsl.ac.uk/staff/martin-page/), on behalf of the [GCC2015 Organising Committee](http://gcc2015.tsl.ac.uk/organisers/).

PS: *And don't forget the [poster abstract](http://gcc2015.tsl.ac.uk/Abstracts) submission deadline is 1 May.*
