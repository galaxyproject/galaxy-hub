A new paper, "[BioBlend: automating pipeline analyses within Galaxy and CloudMan](http://bit.ly/11AuV4O)," by Clare Sloggett, Nuwan Goonasekera and [Enis Afgan|Enis Afgan](/EnisAfgan) has just been published in *[Bioinformatics](http://bioinformatics.oxfordjournals.org/)*. !BioBlend is 

<div class='indent'>
a unified API in a high-level language (python) that wraps the functionality of Galaxy and CloudMan APIs. !BioBlend makes it easy for bioinformaticians to automate end-to-end large-data analysis, from scratch, in a way that is highly accessible to collaborators, by allowing them to both provision the required infrastructure, and automate complex analyses over large data sets within the familiar Galaxy environment.

Documentation is [available at ReadTheDocs](http://bioblend.readthedocs.org/).  !BioBlend can be installed with [PyPI](https://pypi.python.org/pypi), and the source code is at [GitHub](https://github.com/afgane/bioblend).
