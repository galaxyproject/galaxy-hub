<div class='newsItemHeader'>[Main & Test ServerDowntime: 3/14](/News/GalaxyProectServersDown20130314)</div>

The **Galaxy Public [Main Galaxy Server](/Main)** at **http://main.g2.bx.psu.edu** (*[usegalaxy.org](http://usegalaxy.org)*) and **[Test Galaxy Server](/Test)** at **http://test.g2.bx.psu.edu** will be **down on Thursday, March 14, while the team *relocates core hardware to a new server room.***

<div class='right'>![Rerun a job](/Images/Screenshots/re-run-sm.png)</div>

Please note that *ALL jobs running at the time of the shutdown will be terminated.* Once the move is complete, any terminated jobs can be easily restarted using the "re-run" function. 

The *yellow banner on **Main** and **Test** will provide updates* (when the servers are up) as well our **galaxyproject Twitter posts**.

**Galaxy's [Tool Shed](http://toolshed.g2.bx.psu.edu/), [GalaxyProject.org Wiki](/FrontPage), and [Mailing list](/MailingLists) services** will be ***unaffected*** during this time. 

*Thanks for using Galaxy!!*
