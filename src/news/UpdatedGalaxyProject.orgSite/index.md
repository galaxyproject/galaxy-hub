After a long quiescence, the [GalaxyProject.org](http://galaxyproject.org) site has been updated to more accurately reflect the state of the Galaxy project, which is vibrant, collaborative, and growing by leaps and bounds, in case you were wondering.  [GalaxyProject.org](http://galaxyproject.org) is a one stop shop for all things Galaxy, no matter if you want to use the [free public server](/src/Main/index.md), [install your own copy](/Admin/Get Galaxy) either locally or on the cloud, want to [learn how to use Galaxy](/Learn), or perhaps become an [active participant in the Galaxy community](/src/GetInvolved/index.md).

The other well-known Galaxy URLs will continue to be used as well:
* [UseGalaxy.org](http://usegalaxy.org/) - Use the [free public server](/src/Main/index.md).
* [GetGalaxy.org](http://getgalaxy.org/) - Download, install and configure your own Galaxy.
* [GalaxyProject.org/wiki](http://galaxyproject.org/wiki/) - Galaxy community wiki
* [GalaxyProject.org](http://galaxyproject.org/) - The hub and home page for the Galaxy Project.

Please continue to use these wherever appropriate.

Thanks,
