**We just released an update to Galaxy !CloudMan on AWS.** CloudMan offers an easy way to get a personal and completely functional instance of Galaxy in the cloud in just a few minutes, without any manual configuration or imposed quotas. Once running, you have complete control over Galaxy, including the ability to install new tools.

Most notable changes include:
* Galaxy 16.01 release
* A fine-grained control over auto-scaling options
* Several fixes to cluster sharing and cloning

See the [CHANGELOG](https://github.com/galaxyproject/cloudman/blob/master/CHANGELOG) for a more complete set of changes.
