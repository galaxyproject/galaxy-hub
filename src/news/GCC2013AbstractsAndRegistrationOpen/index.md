[GCC2013](/Events/GCC2013) is an opportunity to participate in two full days of presentations, discussions, poster sessions, keynotes, lightning talks and breakouts, all about high-throughput biology and the tools that support it. The conference also includes a [Training Day](/Events/GCC2013/TrainingDay) for the second year in a row, this year with more in-depth topic coverage, more concurrent sessions, and more topics.

If you are a biologist or bioinformatician performing or enabling high-throughput biological research, then please consider attending.  GCC2013 is aimed at:
