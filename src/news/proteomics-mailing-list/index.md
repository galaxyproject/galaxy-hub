The Galaxy community now has a [mailing list dedicated to proteomics](https://lists.galaxyproject.org/lists/galaxy-proteomics.lists.galaxyproject.org/).  If you're using Galaxy to do proteomics, or if you are thinking of doing so then this list if for you.  In case you missed it, there is also a [proteomics wiki page](/src/proteomics/index.md). 

To subscribe to the galaxy-proteomics list please add your email address to the list here:

See [the complete list of mailing lists](/src/mailing-lists/index.md) for more information on this and other Galaxy mailing lists, including links to searchable archives of all Galaxy lists.

Many thanks to Dave C. and the [Galaxy team](/src/galaxy-team/index.md) for setting this up.

Thanks

Ira Cooke
