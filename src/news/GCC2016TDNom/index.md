The [2016 Galaxy Community Conference (GCC2016)](/src/events/GCC2016/index.md) features two full days of training on June 26-27.  Each 
day will have multiple tracks, with each track featuring several sessions throughout the day.  GCC2016 will be held at [Indiana University](http://indiana.edu) in Bloomington, Indiana, United States.

**[GCC2016 Training topics](/src/events/GCC2016/Training/index.md) are [nominated by you](http://bit.ly/gcc2016tdnom), the Galaxy Community.** Please give some thought to what topics you would like to see offered, or that you would like to offer, and then [submit them as topic nominations](http://bit.ly/gcc2016tdnom).  Any topic of interest to the Galaxy Community can be nominated and you are encouraged to nominate more than one topic. If you are looking for ideas, see 
* [Topics nominated for GCC2015](http://bit.ly/gcc2015vote)

* Topics that have already been [nominated for GCC2016](/src/events/GCC2016/Training/index.md#nominated-topics)

Nominated topics will be [published as they come in](/src/events/GCC2016/Training/index.md#nominated-topics).  **Topic nomination closes Friday, October, 16.**.  Topics will be compiled into a uniform list by the GCC2016 Organizing Committee, and topics will be voted on by the Galaxy Community from October 26 through November 6.

Topics will then be selected and scheduled based on topic interest, and the organisers' ability to confirm instructors for each session.  Some very popular sessions may be scheduled more than once. The final schedule will be posted before registration opens.
