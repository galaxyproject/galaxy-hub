[Registration](/src/Events/GCC2012/Register/index.md) is now open for the [2012 Galaxy Community Conference (GCC2012)](/src/Events/GCC2012/index.md).  This annual event will be held [July 25-27](/src/Events/GCC2012/Program/index.md) in [Chicago, Illinois](/src/Events/GCC2012/Logistics/index.md). The 2012 conference features [two full days](/src/Events/GCC2012/Program/index.md) of presentations, breakouts, and lightning talks about extending, developing, deploying, and best practices for Galaxy.  A [day long training event](/src/Events/GCC2012/TrainingDay/index.md) has also been added, covering 7 different topics in multiple tracks. 

The conference will also include talks from the [Galaxy Team](/src/Galaxy Team/index.md) on future project direction, and is a chance to *affect and contribute to Galaxy's future direction.*  If you are a bioinformatics tool developer, data provider, workflow developer, power bioinformatics user, sequencing or bioinformatics core staff, a data and analysis archival specialist, or are otherwise neck-deep in *data-intensive biology* then [GCC2012](/src/Events/GCC2012/index.md) is for you.
