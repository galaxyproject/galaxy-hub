Happy April everyone!  

It's a busy time [in the Galaxy](/GalaxyUpdates/2014_04) and that is reflected in the [April 2014 Galaxy Update](/GalaxyUpdates/2014_04).  First, there were a [record 63 new papers](/GalaxyUpdates/2014_04/#new-papers) in the past month, [six of which we have highlighted](/GalaxyUpdates/2014_04/#new-papers) (also a record).  Three new [public Galaxy servers](/GalaxyUpdates/2014_04/#new-public-servers), and one [Galaxy Community Log Board entry](/GalaxyUpdates/2014_04/#galaxy-community-hubs) were also added in March.
