**[Emory](/Community/Emory University): Software Engineers and Post-Docs**
<br /><br />

The [Taylor Lab](http://bx.mathcs.emory.edu/) in the [Biology](http://www.biology.emory.edu) and [Mathematics & Computer Science](http://www.mathcs.emory.edu) at [Emory University](http://emory.edu/) is looking for 
[software engineers](http://bx.mathcs.emory.edu/joining/sw/) and [postdoctoral scholars](http://bx.mathcs.emory.edu/joining/postdocs/) to work on the Galaxy project.  

We are seeking [software engineers](http://bx.mathcs.emory.edu/joining/sw/) with expertise in distributed computing and systems programming, web-based visualization and visual analytics, informatics and data analysis and integration, and bioinformatics application areas such as re-sequencing, de novo assembly, metagenomics, transcriptome analysis and epigenetics.  These are full time positions located in Atlanta, GA.  See the [official posting](http://bx.mathcs.emory.edu/joining/sw/) for full details.

[Postdoctoral applicants](http://bx.mathcs.emory.edu/joining/postdocs/) should have expertise in Bioinformatics and Computational Biology and research interests that complement but extend the [lab's current interests](http://bx.mathcs.emory.edu/research/): The Galaxy project; distributed and high-performance computing for data intensive science; vertebrate functional genomics; and genomics and epigenomic mechanisms of gene regulation, the role of transcription factors and chromatin structure in global gene expression, development, and differentiation.  See the [announcement](http://bx.mathcs.emory.edu/joining/postdocs/) for full details.
