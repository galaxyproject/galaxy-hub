<div class='newsItemHeader'>[GCC2013 Registration Ends 14 June](/src/News/GCC2013Registration/index.md)</div>

[Register](/src/Events/GCC2013/Register/index.md) for [GCC2013](/Events/GCC2013) by 14 June and avoid the *100%* late surcharges.  Registration is still a bargain with combined registration ([Training Day](/src/Events/GCC2013/TrainingDay/index.md) + [main meeting](/Events/GCC2013/Program)) starting at ~ €165 for post-docs and students (that just €55 per day). **[Register now](/src/Events/GCC2013/Register/index.md)** to assure your spot in the [Training Day workshops](/src/Events/GCC2013/TrainingDay/index.md) you want to attend.  Once a Training Day session becomes full, it will be closed to new registrations.

[GCC2013](/src/Events/GCC2013/index.md) is an opportunity to participate in two full days of presentations, discussions, poster sessions, keynotes, and lightning talks, all about high-throughput biology and the tools that support it. The conference also includes a [Training Day](/src/Events/GCC2013/TrainingDay/index.md) with in-depth topic coverage of twelve different topics in 15 sessions across 5 tracks.

The [program](/src/Events/GCC2013/Program/index.md) features 25 oral presentations, 2 lightning talk sessions, two poster sessions, and an ever growing number of [Birds-of-a-Feather](/src/Events/GCC2013/BoF/index.md) gatherings.

If you are a biologist or bioinformatician performing or enabling high-throughput biological research, then this conference is for you.
