*We are delighted to announce that the [Galaxy Training Network (GTN)](/src/Teach/GTN/index.md) has officially joined the [Global Organisation for Bioinformatics & Training (GOBLET)](http://mygoblet.org).*

GTN is a network of people and groups that present  Galaxy and Galaxy-based training around the world.  GOBLET provides "a global, sustainable support and networking structure for bioinformatics educators/trainers and students/trainees (including a training portal for sharing materials, tools, tips and techniques; guidelines and best practice documents; facilities to help train the trainers; and offering different learning pathways for different types of learner)."

GTN's GOBLET membership will raise the visibility of Galaxy, [Galaxy training](/src/Teach/Resources/index.md), and [Galaxy Trainers](/src/Teach/Trainers/index.md) in the bioinformatics community, and help make the Galaxy Community aware of what GOBLET and its members have to offer.

This membership was made possible by a unique arrangement where these five [GTN members](/src/Teach/Trainers/index.md) each contributed 20% of the cost of a Bronze Organizational Membership:

* [Hans-Rudolf Hotz](/src/HansrudolfHotz/index.md), [Friedrich Miescher Institute (FMI)](http://www.fmi.ch/), Switzerland
* [Björn Grüning](/src/BjoernGruening/index.md), [University of Freiburg](http://www.uni-freiburg.de/), Germany
* [Mark Crowe](http://www.qfab.org/mark-crowe/), [QFAB](http://www.qfab.org/), Australia
* [UC Davis Bioinformatics Core Training Program](http://training.bioinformatics.ucdavis.edu/), United States
* [Galaxy Project](http://galaxyproject.org/), United States

Many thanks to these GTN members for making this happen, and to the GOBLET Executive for this opportunity.
