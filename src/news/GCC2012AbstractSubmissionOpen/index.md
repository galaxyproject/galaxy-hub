[Abstracts](/src/Events/GCC2012/Abstracts/index.md) are now being accepted for oral presentations at the [2012 Galaxy Community Conference (GCC2012)](/src/Events/GCC2012/index.md).

See the [GCC2011 program](/src/Events/GCC2011/index.md) for an idea of the breadth of topics that are covered. Oral presentations will be approximately 15-20 minutes long, including time for question and answer. There will also be an opportunity for lightning talks, which will be solicited at the meeting.
