We’re excited to announce our [next offering of Bioinformatics Bootcamps](https://training.bioinformatics.ucdavis.edu/bootcamps/), which will be held on the [UC Davis](http://www.ucdavis.edu/) campus December 10-13.  

These focused one-day courses are perfect for the student, postdoc, faculty, or industry professional looking to get up to speed quickly on the latest technologies and techniques in bioinformatics. Students will work on their own laptops and have continued access to software and example data used in the exercises through our public [Amazon Web Services virtual machine](http://bioinformatics.ucdavis.edu/software/). The first three bootcamps will use the Galaxy platform, and the final bootcamp will use both Galaxy and the command-line. The Alignment and Assembly bootcamps (Dec. 11th & 12th) require you to know Galaxy, so if you are unfamiliar with Galaxy, you should also take the Introduction bootcamp on Dec. 10th.

 **Tuesday, December 10:**
  **[Introduction to Next-Generation Sequence Analysis with Galaxy](http://training.bioinformatics.ucdavis.edu/2013/10/16/bootcamp-introduction-to-next-generation-sequence-analysis-with-galaxy-december-10-2013/)**

 **Wednesday, December 11:**
  **[Next-Generation Sequence Alignment and Variant Discovery](http://training.bioinformatics.ucdavis.edu/2013/10/16/bootcamp-next-generation-sequence-alignment-and-variant-discovery-december-11-2013/)**

Daily instruction will run from 9am until 5pm. Lunch, light breakfast, and snacks will be provided. Enrollment for each bootcamp will be capped at 24 students. Please enroll early to be assured of a seat, as these bootcamps usually fill up quickly!  More information, including full descriptions of each bootcamp is [available online](https://training.bioinformatics.ucdavis.edu/bootcamps/).  The cost for each bootcamp is $200 (academic/government) or $250 (non-academic/industry).
