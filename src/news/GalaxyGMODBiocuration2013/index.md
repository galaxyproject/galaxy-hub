There are a couple of things going on with the [http://gmod.org/wiki/|GMOD Project](http://gmod.org/wiki/|GMOD Project) that the Galaxy Community might be interested in. If you aren't familiar with GMOD, it is a federation of open-source projects and tools  that enable visualizing, annotating, managing, and analyzing biological research data.  GMOD includes Galaxy and several other widely used tools such as [BioMart](http://gmod.org/wiki/BioMart), [InterMine](http://gmod.org/wiki/InterMine), [MAKER](http://gmod.org/wiki/MAKER), [Chado](http://gmod.org/wiki/Chado) and [GBrowse](http://gmod.org/wiki/GBrowse) and [JBrowse](http://gmod.org/wiki/JBrowse).

The first is that GMOD is running a [community-wide survey](http://gmod.org/survey.html) through March 1. The survey "aims to find out how you are using GMOD, what you find useful (or otherwise), what support you need, and some information on the GMOD components you use."  The survey results will be published and past surveys have been extremely useful to the project.  If that's not enough motivation, once you are done with the survey, you can enter to win a free genome profile from 23andMe.

  &rarr; *C'mon, **[take the dang survey](http://gmod.org/survey.html)**.*

The second is that registration is now open for the [2013 GMOD Meeting](http://gmod.org/wiki/April 2013 GMOD Meeting) being held in Cambridge, UK, April 5 and 6.  There will be a Galaxy presence (at least a project update, and I'm lobbying for a CloudMan workshop as well (and [help AT gmod DOT org](you could lobby too!))).

Finally, [Biocuration 2013](http://www.ebi.ac.uk/biocuration2013/home) is immediately after the GMOD Meeting, and also in Cambridge.  Biocuration will feature a [GO Galaxy Workshop](http://wiki.geneontology.org/index.php/GO_Galaxy_Workshop_at_Biocuration_2013) about using Galaxy to reason with ontologies.
