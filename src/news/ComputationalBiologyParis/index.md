**A 2 and half years [position in Computational Biology](http://drosophile.org/GEDlab/?page_id=760)** is available at the [laboratory of Drosophila Genetics and Epigenetics](http://drosophile.org/) (CNRS UMR 7622 – [University Pierre-et-Marie-Curie](http://www.upmc.fr/en/index.html), Paris) in relation with a consortium of four laboratories funded by the ANR (Plastisipi project).

**Key words:** Software development for NGS analysis, Galaxy integration, Small RNA biogenesis and mechanisms of action, siRNAs, piRNAs, miRNAs.

We are looking for a dynamic candidate with a wide knowledge in computer sciences and statistics. She/He will develop statistical and mathematical procedures to analyze NGS sequencing datasets *and implement them in a Galaxy Framework dedicated to the consortium.*

**Scientific project**': The Plastisipi project is aimed at studying how modulation of the piRNA silencing pathway may regulate Transposable Element repression along Drosophila germ cell differentiation, allowing an appropriate balance between genome protection and genome plasticity. Another exciting aspect of the project is to study the role of tRNAs – or tRNAs derived Fragments (tRFs) – in piRNA biogenesis.

**Job description**: The successful candidate will participate in 1- managing and mining the sequencing datasets generated by Plastisipi to profile piRNAs, tRFs and mRNAs; 2- developing new visualization tools; 3- developing new algorithms to analyze the piRNA signatures at genome-wide level as well as their statistical significance. Depending on the candidate profile, there is also an opportunity to work through a core computing science approach at the development of Galaxy instance “stacks” that could be easily spread into the community.

The ideal candidate holds a PhD degree in computational biology and is experienced in Galaxy developments; however, this profile is not mandatory and candidates with little background in biology but strong experience in core computing sciences, computing infrastructures, mathematics and/or statistics will be welcome too. He/she will collaborate closely with a multi-disciplinary team of biologists and bioinformaticians. Excellent communication, management and reporting skills are essential for this role.

**Favored Experience/Skills:**
* Experience in NGS sequencing dataset analysis
* Advanced knowledge of a least one OOP language
* Knowledge of Postgresql
* Experience in tool integration in the Galaxy framework
* Advanced use of R
* Good notions of cloud computing
* Autonomy and excellent relational and teamwork skills

Contract Duration: Available in January 2014 for two and half years (starting date flexible)
Salary: Depending on qualifications and experience, based on CNRS salary scale.

Application: Send CV, cover letter and two references to [christophe DOT antoniewski AT upmc DOT fr](Christophe Antoniewski).  Shortlisted candidates will be invited for an interview.
