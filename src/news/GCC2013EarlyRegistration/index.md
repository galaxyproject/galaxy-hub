<div class='newsItemHeader'>[GCC2013 Early Registration Ends 24 May](/News/GCC2013EarlyRegistration)</div>

Early registration saves *up to 75% off regular registration costs*, and is downright affordable, with combined registration ([Training Day](/Events/GCC2013/TrainingDay) + [main meeting](/Events/GCC2013/Program)) starting at ~ €95 for post-docs and students. Registering early also assures you a spot in the Training Day workshops you want to attend.  Once a Training Day session becomes full, it will be closed to new registrations.  Early registration closes 24 May.

[GCC2013](/Events/GCC2013) is an opportunity to participate in two full days of presentations, discussions, poster sessions, keynotes, and lightning talks, all about high-throughput biology and the tools that support it. The conference also includes a [Training Day](/Events/GCC2013/TrainingDay) with in-depth topic coverage of twelve different topics in 15 sessions across 5 tracks.

An [early program is available](/Events/GCC2013/Program) featuring 25 oral presentations, lightning talks and poster sessions, and the just added [Birds-of-a-Feather](/Events/GCC2013/BoF) gatherings.

If you are a biologist or bioinformatician performing or enabling high-throughput biological research, then this conference is for you.
