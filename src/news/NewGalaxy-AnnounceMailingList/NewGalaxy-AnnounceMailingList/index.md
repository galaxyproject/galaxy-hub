There is a new mailing list in the Galaxy: [Galaxy-Announce](http://lists.bx.psu.edu/listinfo/galaxy-announce).  

Galaxy-Announce is a *moderated, low-volume mailing list*, and complements the existing [/Mailing Lists](/Mailing Lists): 
* Galaxy-User: about the public server (a.k.a. *[/Main](/src/Main/index.md)*) at [https://usegalaxy.org/|UseGalaxy.org](https://usegalaxy.org/|UseGalaxy.org), and 
* Galaxy-Dev: about Galaxy deployment and development.  
However, unlike those relatively high-volume mailing lists, Galaxy-Announce will only have a few messages each month.  *If you are looking for a Galaxy list that just covers the big stuff, this is your list.*

To subscribe to the list please go to the [Galaxy-Announce Mailman page](http://lists.bx.psu.edu/listinfo/galaxy-announce) and submit your email address to the list.

See [/Mailing Lists](/Mailing Lists) for more information on this and other Galaxy mailing lists, including links to searchable archives of all Galaxy lists.
