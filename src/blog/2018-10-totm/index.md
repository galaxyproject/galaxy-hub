The Galaxy community is developing and maintaining a collection of tutorials that are designed to be interactive and are built around Galaxy: [https://training.galaxyproject.org](https://training.galaxyproject.org). These tutorials can be used for learning and teaching how to use Galaxy for general data analysis, and for learning/teaching specific domains such as assembly and differential gene expression analysis with RNA-Seq data. These materials are targetting both self-paced individual learners and instructors.

To help highlight our tutorials and the training effort of the community, a member of the community will select every month one tutorial and explains in the *Galactic Blog* why they select this tutorial.

## Galaxy 101

This month, the [*Galaxy contributor of the Month!*](2018-10-cotm-yvan-le-bras), Yvan Le Bras, selects and presents a tutorial: ["Galaxy 101"](http://galaxyproject.github.io/training-material/topics/introduction/tutorials/galaxy-intro-101/tutorial.html), from the topic ["Introduction to Galaxy Analyses"](http://galaxyproject.github.io/training-material/topics/introduction/s):

Yvan, we are looking forward to learn more about your choice!

### We learn about you and Galaxy in the [*Galaxy contributor of the Month!* post](2018-10-cotm-yvan-le-bras). Can you do a small recap here?

*Add more here*

Originally a marine ecologist, learning molecular ecology aspect related to population genetics, I obtained a PhD in 2010 after 3 years devoted to quantitative genetics and functional genomics approach of rainbow trout capacities to cope with osmoregulation issues during transfer form freshwater to seawater. Postdoctoral opportunities drop me definitely deeper to the black matter of Bioinformatics and Biostatistics working for Biogenouest western France Life sciences core facilities network through INSERM and CNRS then at INRIA to build a first french e-Science centre dedicated to life sciences. In addition, this was the time for me to concretise a several years old project idea creating the Enancio start-up.

Then, a wonderful opportunity bring me back to my first love, ecology and conservation, working 2 years for the "65 Millions d'observateurs" national project coordinated by French National Museum of Natural History where was set-up the Galaxy-E initiative, initially devoted to citizen science projects related to Biodiversity. Now, my mission is to coordinate the national research infrastructure "Pôle national des données de Biodiversité" (PNDB), e-infrastructure in creation who will act as the French Biodiversity data hub.

My hobbies are related to marine activities in particular sailing and fishing demonstrating every time that I can to family, friends and unknown people the beauty of nature and wild life....

### Can you tell us a little about yourself and your relationship to training?

### Why have you selected this particular tutorial as the tutorial of the month?

I gave something like 30 Galaxy training sessions, always beginning by this introductory tutorial, and this fundamental question: "Which gene in the Human genome contains the most important Exons density?"


Writing these lines, I can see Cyril (Monjeaud), with whom I gave all the training sessions, face expression as it was always like a game to me to transform this "simple" question into a fundamental research one! Concretly, this is a perfect manner to introduce Galaxy functionnalities, interest, using a "simple" few-steps workflow, dealing with remote datasets, well known data banks (here UCSC), and basic but so important and powerfull pre-processing/filtering tools! For sure kind of tools that a lot of people use on the ~every-day lab life!

Another important point, as instructor, is that datasets are very small, so it's easy to treat it rapidly, even on a training session with 20 people

Thanks to Yvan for selecting this tutorial and answering our questions!
