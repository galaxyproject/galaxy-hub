Ever search for "Galaxy" on [Google](https://www.google.com/search?q=galaxy), or [Bing](https://www.bing.com/search?q=galaxy), or [DuckDuckGo](https://duckduckgo.com/?q=galaxy), or [Yahoo!](https://search.yahoo.com/search?q=galaxy)?  Well, if you are interested in [phones](https://www.samsung.com/global/galaxy/), [astronomy](https://davecl.wordpress.com/), [soccer](https://www.lagalaxy.com/), [cars](https://www.ford.co.uk/cars/galaxy)<sup>&#42;</sup>, [chocolate](https://www.galaxychocolate.co.uk/), or [Ansible](https://galaxy.ansible.com/) (ok, that last one is close), then you are in luck.  But, if you are interested in *the one true Galaxy* then the pickings are pretty thin.

There are *many* lessons here:

1. Don't name your project with a widely used word.
1. Don't name your project with a widely used word.
1. Don't name your project with a widely used word.
1. Don't name your project with a widely used word.
1. Don't use a general search tool when searching for information about a so named project.

Fortunately there is a solution to lesson #5: The **[Pan-Galactic Search](/src/search/index.md)** is a custom Google search engine that searches only websites related to *our* Galaxy.  It is available at the top of every page on the Galaxy Community Hub.

Here, as an example, are the top hits when you search for "Galaxy search":

The search further classifies results by where they are found and what they are likely to be relevant to.  The tabs are

* **All results:** Show's all search results.
* **Use:** Results from sites that are likely to be more relevant to *using* Galaxy.
* **Admin/Dev:** Results that are relevant for deploying, administering, and extending Galaxy.
* **Shared:** Histories, workflows, pages and visualizations that have been shared by other Galaxy users.
* **Discussion:** Results from support forums, mailing lists, and chats.
* **Hub:** Shows only information that is located on the this web site, the Galaxy Community Hub.
* **Tools:** Results about tools available in the Galaxy ecosystem.
* **Code:** Results about the Galaxy source code.
* **Requests:** Results about bug reports and feature requests.

The **Galaxy Publication Search** tab searches the [Galaxy Publication Library](https://www.zotero.org/groups/1732893/galaxy) using Zotero's built in search.  It will show you publications relevant to your search.  (It's not integrated into the Google search because Google doesn't want to search collections of material available elsewhere on the web.)

Happy searching,<br />
