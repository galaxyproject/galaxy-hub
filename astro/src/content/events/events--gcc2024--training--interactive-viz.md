# Interactive Visualizations

</div>

This session will give an overview of the Galaxy Visualization Framework.  We will cover the 'Charts' side of the framework, and the more free-form plugin side of Galaxy Visualizations.

We will also cover the basics of how to create a new visualization plugin for Galaxy, and how to use the existing visualization plugins in Galaxy.

You should come to this training with a running local Galaxy instance, and your favorite text editor.

For bonus points have a new visualization in mind that you'd like to get integrated into Galaxy, and we'll try to get it done!
