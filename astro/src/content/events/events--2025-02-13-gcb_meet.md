[SIG representatives](https://galaxyproject.org/community/sig/) are welcome to join the quarterly meeting of the Galaxy Community Board! Our meeting times roll across months to ensure at least one meeting is work-day friendly for anyone on the planet.

In each Galaxy Community Board meeting, we focus on a particular task or need from the SIG chairs. We work collectively to drive Galaxy development to serve our communities - so make sure your community is represented!
