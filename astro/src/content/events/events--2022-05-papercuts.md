## Interested?

On Papercuts Day, please **join us on [Gitter](https://gitter.im/galaxyproject/Lobby)** (all day). If you don't have a GitHub or Gitter (or Element/Matrix) account yet, then set them up (in that order).

# Before the event

If you are a Galaxy user or admin, you can create, or tag existing GitHub issues for any irritating, but likely easily fixed bugs (make a guess). These can be in any part of Galaxy, not just the core engine, and includes training, documentation, and other software.

### Resources

If you have time, and want to learn more about contributing you are encouraged to review:

* [A collection of short videos](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLNFLKDpdM3B8Ro-V0mZboQjj40RimRZ8n), highlighting how to do common useful tasks during Paper Cuts and beyond.
* [Development in Galaxy tutorials](https://training.galaxyproject.org/training-material/topics/dev/).
* [Contributing to the Galaxy Training Material tutorials](https://training.galaxyproject.org/training-material/topics/contributing/).
* [Galaxy on GitHub](https://github.com/galaxyproject) - see what projects are supported and find the one that speaks to you. Pay particular attention to each project's CONTRIBUTING.md files.

# During the event

We will be on [Gitter](https://gitter.im/galaxyproject/Lobby) for chat all day long.

There are also two GTN CoFest calls planned for the day.

## Issues to work on

This papercut day we're going to focus on some **UI-UX** issues for the **New History**. If that's not your specialty, feel free to pick something else OR you can challenge yourself to learn something new!

[You can find the project board and list of issues here!](https://github.com/orgs/galaxyproject/projects/23/views/4)

## After the event

*Get those pull requests in! And address anything from the review! And become more involved in the Galaxy code, training, and documentation base!*

## Want to host?

If you're a member of a working group and would like to nominate yourselves to host a papercut event, please contact Assunta DeSanto.
