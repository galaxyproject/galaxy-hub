Please [join us at Noon, US Eastern time](https://psu.zoom.us/j/92752763386) ([see in your timezone](https://www.timeanddate.com/worldclock/fixedtime.html?msg=Galaxy+Developer+Roundtable\&iso=20210304T12\&p1=179\&ah=1)) for an open discussion about Galaxy release testing. The release testing process has been thoroughly revamped for the last few releases, and this resulted in higher quality releases. Find out what's been changed and what is involved with testing a new release.

The [Galaxy Developer Roundatble](/community/devroundtable/) meets every other Thursday as long as there are [one or more presenters signed up for the week](https://bit.ly/gxdevroundtablepresent).  These gatherings are an opportunity for presenters (Galaxy users, developers, admins) to interactively engage with the Galaxy developer community.
