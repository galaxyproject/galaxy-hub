We’re excited to host our first hands-on workshop on Galaxy tool development in Freiburg. This 1st session is tailored for internal team members, but we plan to offer regular workshops in the future—both online and in-person—targeted at a broad range of scientific communities and disciplines.

Whether you're new to the Galaxy ecosystem or looking to contribute to the [Intergalactic Utilities Commission (IUC)](https://galaxyproject.org/iuc/), these workshops will offer a valuable opportunity to learn from experienced instructors and developers and gain hands-on experience in building or updating Galaxy tools.

# What You'll Learn

## Day 1: Step-by-Step Walkthrough of Galaxy Tool Development

* Setting up your development environment ([VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/download), [Planemo](https://planemo.readthedocs.io/en/latest/index.html), [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/ubuntu/), [Conda](https://docs.conda.io/projects/conda/en/stable/user-guide/install/linux.html))
* Writing, testing, and publishing Galaxy tools
* Understanding and contributing to the Galaxy tool ecosystem

## Day 2: Bring Your Own Tool or Contribute to the [IUC Repository](https://github.com/galaxyproject/tools-iuc)

* Wrap your own tool using Galaxy best practices
* Or, enhance an existing [IUC](https://galaxyproject.org/iuc/) tool by improving tests, versions, or functionality

# Prerequisites

* Basic knowledge of shell scripting and command-line tools
* Familiarity with Python and/or R is helpful but not required
* Please ensure that [VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/download) (with the [Galaxy extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=davelopez.galaxy-tools)), [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/ubuntu/), and [Conda](https://docs.conda.io/projects/conda/en/stable/user-guide/install/linux.html) are installed prior to the event

Number of Participants: 12

# Recommended Resources

* [Galaxy SDK (Planemo Documentation)](https://planemo.readthedocs.io/): Comprehensive resource for tool development, testing, and deployment.
* [Complete 4-hour Tool Development Tutorial](https://planemo.readthedocs.io/en/latest/writing.html): Highly recommended for all participants. Walks you through building and testing a Galaxy tool step by step.
* [Planemo in Scientific Literature](https://doi.org/10.1101/gr.276963.122): Learn about the motivations and impact of Planemo in tool development
* [Quick Blog Post: 3 Steps to Galaxify Your Tool](https://usegalaxy-eu.github.io/posts/2020/08/22/three-steps-to-galaxify-your-tool/): A concise summary of the process to publish your tool to the European Galaxy serve.
* Important Repos for Galaxy tools
  * [tools-IUC](https://github.com/galaxyproject/tools-iuc)
  * [bgruening’s Galaxy Tools](https://github.com/bgruening/galaxytools)

Stay tuned for future workshops open to the wider community—we look forward to helping you take your first steps (or next big leap) in Galaxy tool development!
