## Support from eLife and F1000Research

Childcare at GCC2019 is generously supported sponsorships from [eLife](https://elifesciences.org/) and [F1000Research](https://f1000research.com/).

***[eLife](https://elifesciences.org/)*** is a non-profit open access journal, publishing research from across the life and biomedical sciences. We also invest heavily in software development, new product design, collaboration and outreach. This includes the development of open-source tools, with extensible capabilities, that can be used, adopted and modified by any interested party to help move towards an ecosystem that serves science and scientists as efficiently and as cost-effectively as possible.

Have you got an idea that will bring cutting-edge technology to open research communication? We are here to help.

[F1000Research](https://f1000research.com/) is proud this year to be sponsoring childcare for GCC2019, which we feel is vital for inclusivity. F1000Research is an Open Access publishing platform for the life sciences that publishes a range of different article types, from traditional research articles, to method articles and software tools. The platform is particularly well suited to publishing software tool articles as our versioning system allows small updates at any time, we have proper syntax highlighting and we can support LaTeX and markdown submissions.

Our [Galaxy Gateway](https://f1000research.com/gateways/galaxy) on the platform brings together articles, posters and slides from Galaxy events. The Gateway allows authors to quickly share their work with the community, boosting visibility and giving researchers proper credit for their contribution.
