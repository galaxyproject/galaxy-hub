# Housing

Conference housing is on campus in Reed College Dorms.  See the [venue information](/events/gccbosc2018/venue/) for more, and for a link to Reed College's list of recommended hotels (many offering a discount for those attending events at Reed).

**[Book housing now](https://gccbosc2018housing.eventbrite.com/) for GCCBOSC 2018.**

## Got kids?

GCCBOSC 2018 enthusiastically welcomes your kids (and offers childcare), *but the Reed College dorms do not.*  The dorms have a strict no minors policy, so if you are bringing your kids you'll need to stay off campus.

See [Children at GCCBOSC 2018](/events/gccbosc2018/faq/#children-at-gccbosc2018) for lodging options, childcare and more.

# Meals

## Breakfast

If you are [staying on campus](/events/gccbosc2018/venue/#housing) breakfast at the [Reed College Commons Cafe](http://reed.cafebonappetit.com/cafe/commons-cafe/) is included with your room.  Breakfast can also be purchased at the cafe if you are staying off campus.

## Lunch

Lunch is included with your training and meeting registrations and will be at the [Reed College Commons Cafe](http://reed.cafebonappetit.com/cafe/commons-cafe/) or catered by [Bon Appétit](https://reed.catertrax.com/shopcatgroup.asp?id=2\&url=/index.asp).  If you are on campus but are not registered for the day's event then you can also purchase lunch here.

We don't yet know if lunch will be provided during [CollaborationFest](/events/gccbosc2018/collaboration/).

## Dinner

Except for the conference dinner on Thursday (included with meeting registration), dinner is not included in your event registrations.  There are a number of restaurants and pubs in the [nearby Woodstock neighborhood](https://www.yelp.com/search?find_loc=Woodstock,+Portland,+OR\&start=0\&l=g:-122.61042594909668,45.48405300583157,-122.62330055236816,45.47502579850064), including [these recommendations](/events/gccbosc2018/venue/#recommended-pubs-and-restaurants-near-reed).  The [Reed College Commons Cafe](http://reed.cafebonappetit.com/cafe/commons-cafe/) will also be open on select nights for dinner.
