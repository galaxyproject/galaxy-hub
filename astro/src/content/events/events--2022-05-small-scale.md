The Galaxy Small Scale Galaxy Admins group is a [community of practice](https://galaxyproject.org/community/#communities-of-practice). It has grown out of the "Small Scale Servers" subcommittee of the [Global Galaxy Steering Committee](https://galaxyproject.org/community/steering/).
The meetings are taking place every two months.
