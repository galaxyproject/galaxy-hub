## What is it about?

The 2nd de.NBI Cloud User Meeting is an upcoming 3-day event (03.09.2018-05.09.2018) in Heidelberg for people interested in Bioinformatics, Cloud Computing or Big Data. Due to the diversity of approaches that arise in this exciting and rapidly evolving cloud computing technology niche, this meeting should help to exchange ideas and approaches in the growing de.NBI Cloud community.

We aim to advantage our attendees, from beginner to expert, with comprehensive understanding of the very broad application and benefit of the de.NBI Cloud. This event is your chance of meeting users, developers and administrators using the de.NBI Cloud. We feature topics from introduction or use case talks to introduce different technologies (OpenStack, Docker, Kubernetes, Nextflow, ….) to tutorials and workshops that will help understand how to actually apply the technology in your research.
