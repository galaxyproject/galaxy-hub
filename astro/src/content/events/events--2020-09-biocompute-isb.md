The workshop features an intro talk, then 3 brief tool demos, show examples from [data.glygen.org](http://data.glygen.org/) and [data.oncomx.org](http://data.oncomx.org/), briefly discuss how they are used, and then show the [Portal tool](https://portal.aws.biochemistry.gwu.edu/sign-in) that can be used for making them. We will then do the same for the AWS [HIVE instance](http://hive.aws.biochemistry.gwu.edu/) and the AWS [Galaxy instance](http://galaxy.aws.biochemistry.gwu.edu/).

After that we will have breakout sessions for live discussion.

Schedule:

* 10-15 min Intro
* 15 min Portal Platform
* 15 min HIVE Platform
* 15 min Galaxy Platform
* 45 min Breakout sessions
