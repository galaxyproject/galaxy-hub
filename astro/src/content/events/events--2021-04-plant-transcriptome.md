The purpose of this workshop is to gain knowledge on Next Generation Sequencing (NGS) with a special focus on bulk and single-cell RNA-Seq data analysis in *Arabidopsis thaliana*. Although it is designed to deal with plant transcriptome data analysis, most of the analysis can be adapted to other organisms too.
