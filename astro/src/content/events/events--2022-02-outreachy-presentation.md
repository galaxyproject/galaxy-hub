*Please join our Outreachy interns - Rahmot, and Chinonye - in celebrating their contributions to the Galaxy Community!*

Our interns have been hard at work over the past few months, focusing on two main projects: one is a **Galaxy Mentor Network** for folks joining the Galaxy Community, the other is a **Galaxy Community Onboarding Playbook**. Both will undoubtedly lead to a more helpful, more welcoming Galaxy community for newcomers!

Rahmot, and Chinonye are excited to share their work on the **Galaxy Mentor Network** with the community and recieve feedback. Please join us to show appreciation for their wonderful contributions!
