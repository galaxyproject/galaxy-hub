This webinar will highlight Galaxy resources for **systems administrators and computational infrastructure providers**.  It's part of the *Galaxy Resources Webinar Series*.  Each webinar in that series highlights resources for a different audience.

Galaxy can empower your community to create and run their own sophisticated and repeatable data analyses and visualizations, without requiring them to learn command line interfaces or Linux systems administration.  If you are interested in helping your researchers help themselves with their data analyses, then this webinar is for you.  We will cover resources available in the Galaxy ecosystem to help those who setup and maintain production Galaxy servers.
