### Before the event

If you are a Galaxy user or admin, you can create, or tag existing, GitHub issues for any irritating, but likely easily fixed bugs (make a guess). These can be in any part of Galaxy, not just the core engine, and includes training, documentation, and other software.

If you don't have a GitHub or Gitter account yet, then set them up (in that order).

If you have time, and want to learn more about contributing you are encouraged to review:

* [Development in Galaxy tutorials](https://training.galaxyproject.org/training-material/topics/dev/)
* [Contributing to the Galaxy Training Material tutorials](https://training.galaxyproject.org/training-material/topics/contributing/)
* [Galaxy on GitHub](https://github.com/galaxyproject) - see what projects are supported and find the one that speaks to you.  Pay particular attention to each project's CONTIBUTING.md files

### During the event

We will have video calls throughout the day and be on Gitter for chat all day long.  Please take advantage of both to communicate with your collaborators around the world.

### After the event

*Get those pull requests in!  And address anything from the review! And become more involved in the Galaxy code, training, and documentation base!*

### Communication

Communication will happen through GitHub, [Gitter channels](https://gitter.im/galaxyproject/Lobby) and [Zoom](https://github.com/galaxyproject/galaxy-hub/blob/master/events/2020-10-papercuts/#join-us-in-our-regular-video-calls).  Links will be posted here before the event.  If you register your interest (see above), we'll send you email too.
