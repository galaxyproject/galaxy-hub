This workshop will be hands-on and teach participants how to manage their data, understand and execute tools, save and reuse workflows, and visualize processed data, all from within Galaxy. The hands-on exercises will begin with a simple analysis pipeline and extend to a complete analysis of published RNA-seq data.

Registration is required, but free and open to anyone in the George Washington University. Register [here](http://bit.do/gxyGWUwrkshp).

No programming or Linux command line experience is required.
