## Background:

With you at the heart of our project and with a mission to help community members improve proficiency and grow with Galaxy, we are pleased to announce the launch of the **Galaxy Mentor Network**.

The **Galaxy Mentor Network** (GMN) program will help members transition smoothly from one part of the community to another. It will also help members learn how to use the Galaxy tools and servers efficiently. The end goal of this project is to develop more experienced members and to speed up the growth process for new members who join the community.

This project goes to show how people-centred the Galaxy community is. Every member will soon have the opportunity to be mentored by topic-based experts and mentors. Professors and students carrying out their projects can work on their projects under the guidance of mentors. This project is a win-win for all participants: Mentors grow in experience, gain new leadership skills and sharpen their expertise, while members can learn about open source, how to create, materials, or even carry out their projects with expert supervision and guidance.

Join us for our exciting online launch event where we will be telling you everything you need to know about the **Galaxy Mentor Network** program and answer any questions you may have as regards the program.

## Agenda:

* Initial Remarks by the Outreachy Mentors (Bérénice, Assunta, Beatriz, or Anne) about the Outreachy interns.
