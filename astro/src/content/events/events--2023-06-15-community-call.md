This community call has been cancelled. Typically, at our calls we share some community updates followed by a presentation. If you'd like to discuss particular topics, please add them to the [agenda](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1PYUnO_td7f-l0fxRYDn8D6ER7W6eY-E9mUx8ErT8kJ4/edit?usp=sharing) or bring them to the next call!

The [Galaxy Community calls](/community/community-calls/) are community gatherings happening every other Thursday. Everyone is welcome to present! Have something you want to talk about at a future call? [Get in touch](mailto:outreach@galaxyproject.org).
