#### What is Galaxy and why could it be interesting to me?

Galaxy is a web-based, open source, data integration and analysis platform for life science research. The core pillars of the application are:

* **Accessibility**: enable bench scientists to create bioinformatics analyses
* **Reproducibility**: facilitate computational methods to be completely easily reproducible
* **Transparency**: enable easy sharing and publishing of research data and analyses

A sample instance of the application that is free to use is available at [usegalaxy.org](https://usegalaxy.org/).
Although focused around Galaxy, this workshop is open to anyone interested in the above topics without their specific ties to the application.
