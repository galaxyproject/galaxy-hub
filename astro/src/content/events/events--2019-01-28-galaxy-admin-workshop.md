**[Galaxy Admin Training](https://github.com/galaxyproject/dagobah-training)** will be offered January
28 through February 1 at Penn State University, where the Galaxy Project got started over ten years ago.
The workshop is split into a [2 day introductory session](https://github.com/galaxyproject/dagobah-training#basic-sessions) and a [3 day advanced topics session](https://github.com/galaxyproject/dagobah-training#advanced-sessions).  Participants can register for one or both sessions.

This workshop will cover [basic](https://github.com/galaxyproject/dagobah-training#basic-sessions)
and [advanced topics](https://github.com/galaxyproject/dagobah-training#advanced-sessions) you
need to know to set up your own production, high-performance and multi-user Galaxy instance.\
Sessions will be *intensive and hands-on*, and taught by experienced instructors from the Galaxy Community.
Participants will learn how to install, configure, customize, and extend their own Galaxy servers.
Topics include tool configuration, authentication and user management, using heterogeneous storage and
compute services, and many other topics that will enable you to get your own Galaxy server up and running,
performing well, and used by your community.

Galaxy is an open web based platform for biomedical data integration and analysis. It is deployed at
large and small organizations around the world and used in a broad range of biomedical research domains,
and across the tree of life.
