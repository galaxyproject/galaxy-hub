On Monday 04.12.2017 the Rechenzentrum of the University of Freiburg is hosting an introductory workshop on creation, usage, maintenance and sharing of Virtual Research Environments (VRE). The focus is on Neuroscience-related software (e.g. NEST, Neuron, Tensorflow, Python) but the methods and examples presented can be applied to other scientific fields as well.
