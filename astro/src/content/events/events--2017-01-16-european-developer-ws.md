The European Galaxy Developer Workshop is about integration and deployment of high-quality tools and visualizations into Galaxy, configuration of a production-ready Galaxy server, Docker, and Conda.

Learning goals:
During this 4 day course, attendees will learn how to integrate high-quality tools and visualisations into Galaxy using best practice guidelines and finally how to deploy them. The last day will be spent to learn how to configure a production ready Galaxy server. Moreover, at the end of this course you will have a profound knowledge about Docker and Conda.
