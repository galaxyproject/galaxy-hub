# CoFest

Anyone who would like to contribute, learn how to contribute to the Galaxy Training Material or just catch up with the community is very welcome to join.

We will coordinate via Zoom and the [GTN Gitter channel](https://gitter.im/Galaxy-Training-Network/Lobby).

# GTN Call

The idea of these meetings is to share news about Galaxy and Training, but also just talk together. *Everyone is welcome to join!*

To accommodate different time zones and schedules, there will be 2 calls (with similar discussions) at [8am (UTC + 2)](https://arewemeetingyet.com/Berlin/2020-11-19/08:00/GTN%20meeting) and [4pm (UTC + 2)](https://arewemeetingyet.com/Berlin/2020-11-19/16:00/GTN%20meeting).
