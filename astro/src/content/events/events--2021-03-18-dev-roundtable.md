Please [join us](https://psu.zoom.us/j/92752763386) at Noon, US Eastern time ([see in your timezone](https://www.timeanddate.com/worldclock/fixedtime.html?msg=Galaxy+Developer+Roundtable\&iso=20210318T12\&p1=179\&ah=1)) for an open discussion about **Integrating GPU Resources in Galaxy for accelerating tool executions.** The discussion will be led by [Jashwant Raj](http://www.cse.psu.edu/~jqg5490/) and Gulsum Gudukbay of Penn State University. They are working on [an NSF grant in the Mahmut Kandemir (PI) lab](https://news.psu.edu/story/598806/2019/11/18/research/computer-science-and-engineering-professor-receives-35m-nsf-grant) that addresses this challenge.

The topic is also very timely: See [New hardware: More Storage and GPUs](https://galaxyproject.eu/posts/2020/11/17/new-compute-nodes/).

The [Galaxy Developer Roundatble](/community/devroundtable/) meets every other Thursday as long as there are [one or more presenters signed up for the week](https://bit.ly/gxdevroundtablepresent).  These gatherings are an opportunity for presenters (Galaxy users, developers, admins) to interactively engage with the Galaxy developer community.
