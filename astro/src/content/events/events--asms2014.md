## Workshop 7: The Galaxy Framework for Biological MS Informatics: Practical Tips for Software Developers and Users

**Wednesday, 5:45-7:00 PM, Room 339-340. <br />
Tim Griffin (presiding), University of Minnesota**

The open source Galaxy software framework is gaining momentum as
a tool to solve biological MS informatics problems. It offers unique
features such as flexibility to integrate disparate software programs into
effective workflows, and the ability to share complete workflows with
other researchers. In this workshop, expert developers and users of
Galaxy for biological MS data analysis will present practical tutorials.
Presentations will be aimed at informing both software developers and
biologists/analytical chemists on how they can make effective use of
the Galaxy framework in their research.
