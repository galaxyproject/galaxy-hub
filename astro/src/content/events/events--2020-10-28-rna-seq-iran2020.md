**An Introduction to RNA-seq Analysis (Human, Mouse) using Galaxy at University of Isfahan (in Persian)**

**28th October 2020, 30th October 2020**

**Description:**

The Freiburg Galaxy team and University of Isfahan organize an online workshop in Persian to demonstrate how Galaxy can be used for RNA-seq data analysis.

**Agenda:**

* An Introduction to NGS
* An Introduction to RNA-sequencing (Experimental and In silico)
* The applications of RNA-seq
* RNA-seq databases
* Statistical principals of gene expression analysis: p-value, Log2FC, FPKM
* Introduction to Galaxy
* Case study I: Human and Mouse RNA-seq data analysis using HISAT2, FeatureCounts and Limma tools in order to achieve Differential Expressed Genes (DEGs)
* Case study II:Investigation of downstream pathways relating to DEGs: GO and Pathway Analyses

**Target audience:**
Students (BSc, MSc, or PHD) of biology, medicine, medical engineering and computer sciences clinical laboratory technician.

### Speakers:

* Maryam Kay, Ph.D.
* Fariba Dehghanian, Assistant Professor, Department of Cell and Molecular Biology & Microbiology, University of Isfahan
