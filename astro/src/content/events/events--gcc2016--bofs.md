## GCC2016 BoFs

**The [current list of BoFs is available on the conference web site](http://bit.ly/gcc2016BOFS).** BoFs are posted as soon as they are proposed.  The exact time and schedule for each will be set later.

## Want to plan a BoF?

To launch a Birds of a Feather meetup **[submit your BoF idea here](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/1aikQugTW_VlY5K0TQ3cI9E2NVIk443gkzK6EqP8gsr4/viewform).** Once submitted, the conference organizers will create the [BoF in the conference schedule](http://bit.ly/gcc2016BOFS), and give you edit access.

## BoF Support

The conference *enables and encourages* BoFs by

* Encouraging conference participants to organize BoFs
* Promote BoFs to all conference participants, over and over, both before and during the conference.
* Coordinate and reserve rooms for BoFs, and allocate time in the schedule for them too.
