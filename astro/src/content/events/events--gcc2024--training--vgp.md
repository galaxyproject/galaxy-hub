# Genome Assembly with VGP Workflows

</div>

In this session, we will introduce the genome assembly workflows developed in collaboration with the Vertebrate Genome Project (VGP). We will demonstrate how to assemble a genome and how to evaluate the quality of your assembly, as well as the steps you can take to improve it.

Hi, I am Delphine, I have been part of the galaxy team for almost 8 years and a user for about 10. I am interested in genome assembly, epigenetics, comparative genomics... In my free time I like to read and play board and video games.
