# General information

In a talk (in person), we present Galaxy and the European Galaxy Server together with the Galaxy Training Network to scientists. You will get an overview about the Galaxy project, tools, data and databases of the European Galaxy Server, and workflow creation for automatizing data analysis. The Galaxy Training Network (GTN) provides over 380 high-quality tutorials to guide you through different types of data analysis.
