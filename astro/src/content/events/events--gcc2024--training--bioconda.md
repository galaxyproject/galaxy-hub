# BioConda & BioContainers

</div>

In this training you will learn how the Bioconda and BioContainers infrastructure is working. How it integrates with Galaxy and how you can contribute to it.

## Meet the Instructor

### Björn Grüning

University of Freiburg <br>
My name is Björn Grüning from the University of Freiburg in Germany. I'm part of the Bioconda and BioContainers community. Bioconda and BioContainers are an essential part of the Galaxy ecosystem to enhance reproducibility of research but also to make maintaining a Galaxy server with a large tool set easier.
