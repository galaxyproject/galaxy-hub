# Assembly and Annotation

</div>

In this training session, participants will be instructed on the comprehensive methodologies for genome assembly and annotation using the Galaxy platform. The session will  cover the s process of assembling raw sequencing reads into contiguous sequences, followed by the annotation of the assembled genome to  identify genes and functional elements. Attendees will engage in hands-on practice with Galaxy's interface and assembly tools.

## Meet the Instructor

### Björn Grüning

University of Freiburg <br>
My name is Björn Grüning from the University of Freiburg in Germany. I'm part of the Bioconda and BioContainers community. Bioconda and BioContainers are an essential part of the Galaxy ecosystem to enhance reproducibility of research but also to make maintaining a Galaxy server with a large tool set easier.
