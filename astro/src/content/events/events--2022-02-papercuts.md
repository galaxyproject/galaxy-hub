## Interested?

On Papercuts Day, please **join us on [Gitter](https://gitter.im/galaxyproject/Lobby)** (all day). If you don't have a GitHub or Gitter (or Elements/Matrix) account yet, then set them up (in that order).

# Before the event

If you are a Galaxy user or admin, you can create, or tag existing GitHub issues for any irritating, but likely easily fixed bugs (make a guess). These can be in any part of Galaxy, not just the core engine, and includes training, documentation, and other software.

### Resources

If you have time, and want to learn more about contributing you are encouraged to review:

* [A collection of short videos](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLNFLKDpdM3B8Ro-V0mZboQjj40RimRZ8n), highlighting how to do common useful tasks during Paper Cuts and beyond.
* [Development in Galaxy tutorials](https://training.galaxyproject.org/training-material/topics/dev/).
* [Contributing to the Galaxy Training Material tutorials](https://training.galaxyproject.org/training-material/topics/contributing/).
* [Galaxy on GitHub](https://github.com/galaxyproject) - see what projects are supported and find the one that speaks to you. Pay particular attention to each project's CONTRIBUTING.md files.

# During the event

We will be on [Gitter](https://gitter.im/galaxyproject/Lobby) for chat all day long, and on calls spread across the day. Please take advantage of both to communicate with your collaborators around the world.
