* **Contact**: Pavankumar Videm ([videmp@informatik.uni-freiburg.de](mailto:videmp@informtik.uni-freiburg.de))

# Pedagogical information

**Target Audience**: Scientists with no or little Galaxy experience who want to analyse single-cell sequencing data.

**Learning Objectives:**

* To get introduced to Galaxy as a data analysis platform and the GTN training material
* To learn how to use tools and databases in Galaxy
* Preprocessing, clustering, and downstream analysis of single-cell data

**Training material:**
For the hands-on course, we will use the [training material](https://training.galaxyproject.org) from the Galaxy Training Network.
