## Abstract

**The European Galaxy server: A platform for accessible, reproducible and collaborative
big data analyses**

Analysis of large biomedical datasets produced by high-throughput data generation
technologies requires sophisticated statistical and computational methods, as well as
substantial computational power. Researchers want to be involved in their computation-
dependent data analyses but therefore they need a suitable computational infrastructure and
in-depth bioinformatics training. The Galaxy project tries to solve this by providing a framework
for accessible, reproducible and collaborative data analysis to ensure the researcher
participation on their own data analysis. Galaxy is an open-source web-based scientific data
analysis platform used nowadays by hundreds of thousands of scientists across the world to
analyze large biomedical datasets such as those found in e.g. epigenetics, genomics,
transcriptomics, proteomics, metabolomics, multi-omics analysis, imaging, and many more.
Our team is providing high-quality hands-on training material on data analysis with Galaxy,
and we give training courses and workshops for Galaxy users and admins everywhere in the
world.
