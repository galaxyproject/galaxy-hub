*Please join our Outreachy intern - Pia - in celebrating her contributions to the Galaxy Community!*

Our interns have been hard at work over the past few months, focusing on two main projects: one is a **Galaxy Mentorship Network** for folks joining the Galaxy Community, the other is a **Galaxy Community Onboarding Kit**.  Both will undoubtedly lead to a more helpful, more welcoming Galaxy community for newcomers!

Pia is thrilled to share her work on the Galaxy Community Onboarding Kit with the community and receive feedback. Please join us to show appreciation for her fantastic contributions!

**Call details soon!**

[Join us via Zoom](https://psu.zoom.us/j/93434216845?pwd=Qy9Bc0w1cDFBeEVkYWdMV0hFUEpmZz09) at 11:00 US Eastern time ([see your time](https://www.timeanddate.com/worldclock/fixedtime.html?msg=Outreachy+presentation\&iso=20220303T11\&p1=3705\&ah=1)).
