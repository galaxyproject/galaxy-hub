## BoF Support

The conference *enables and encourages* BoFs by

* Encouraging conference participants to organize BoFs
* Use this wiki page as a hub for BoFs at GCC2014.
* Promote BoFs to all conference participants, over and over, both before and during the conference ~~until everyone actually grows feathers~~.
* Coordinate and reserve rooms for BoFs, and allocate time in the schedule for them too.
