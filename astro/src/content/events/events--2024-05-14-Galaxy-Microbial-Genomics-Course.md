## Contents

This course will provide an overview of the field of genomics and how to use the Galaxy platform for genome analysis, with the main focus on the assembly and annotation of bacterial genomes. Galaxy is a web-based platform that allows users to perform complex bioinformatics tasks without coding. By the end of this course, you will be able to:

• Understand the basic concepts and terminology of genomics and bioinformatics
• Use Galaxy to access and analyze genomic data from various sources
• Apply state-of-the-art bioinformatics tools to perform common genomic tasks such as sequence alignment, variant calling, and functional annotation
• Explore the genomics workflow from data acquisition to interpretation and visualization
• Evaluate the possibilities and limitations of genome analysis and Galaxy

The course will consist of lectures and hands-on sessions, where you will have the opportunity to practice using Galaxy and the bioinformatics tools on real-world datasets. The course is designed for PhD students, postdoctoral fellows or other scientists who have a solid background in bioinformatics and molecular biology and want to learn more about genomics and Galaxy.
