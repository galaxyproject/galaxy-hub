This Workshop is organised by ELIXIR CZ at the Institute of Organic Chemistry and Biochemistry of the CAS in cooperation with the Czech Society for Mass Spectrometry.

Analysing proteomics data involves a multitude of computational steps. This workshop will introduce the basics of how to design and run these steps within Galaxy, a free and easy-to-use web platform that enables users to connect bioinformatics tools into a workflow.

The focus will be on proteomics tools available for Galaxy and development of workflows to combine processing steps.

Instructors: Andrea Argentini, Frederik Coppens, Pavel Dvorak, Matthias Fahrner, Melanie Foell, Björn Grüning, Martin Hubálek, Hana Pergl Sustkova, Marek Vrbacky
