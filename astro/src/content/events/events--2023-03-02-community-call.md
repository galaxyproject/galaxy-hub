We will have some community updates followed by a presentation by the Galaxy PIs on the [**2023 Galaxy Roadmap**](https://hackmd.io/J8km_DwbTg2QzUkv4ijCmw) for community feedback. If you'd like to discuss particular topics, please add them to the [agenda](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1PYUnO_td7f-l0fxRYDn8D6ER7W6eY-E9mUx8ErT8kJ4/edit?usp=sharing) or bring them to the call!

**Please [join us via zoom](https://zoom.us/j/93232917829?pwd=NThHTkdDYmFTRExuV0VvaE1vRmZ1UT09) at 5 pm UTC** ([see in your timezone](https://www.timeanddate.com/worldclock/fixedtime.html?msg=Galaxy+community+call\&iso=20230302T17\&p1=1440\&ah=1)) for an open discussion.
