## Penn State Galaxy Workshop 2022

---

<div class="alert alert-info" role="alert">
  Free registration is <b>required</b> for this workshop. This will allow us to prepare well and make it as effective as possible. Please use <a href="https://forms.gle/uoiVHyknURmBMK5z5">[this form]</a> to register.
</div>

This workshop is for you if:

* You generate *any* types of sequence data (Sanger, Illumina, Oxford Nanopore, Pacific Biosciences)
* Use sequence data to perform *any* types of analyses (variation detection, Genome Assembly, ChIP-seq, RNAseq \[including single cell], Metagenomics, etc...)
* Work with proteomic, metabolomics, or imaging data
* Work in computational chemistry

The workshop will be divided in six parts. The first five cover analysis of data from the standpoint of researchers who generate and analyze the data.  The last part is aimed at developers who want to integrate their tools into Galaxy or develop automated analyses utilizing Galaxy workflows and infrastructure.

<div class="alert alert-success" role="alert">
  All workshops will begin promptly at 2 pm (14:00)!
