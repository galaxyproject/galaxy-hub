[NIH's Sequence Read Archive (SRA)](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/sra) will become an integrated data source on [UseGalaxy.org](https://usegalaxy.org) this month. This functionality is also built in to the upcoming 20.05 release of Galaxy. With this connection, you will be able to go from Galaxy to SRA and then ship selected data directly back to the Galaxy instance you came from.

This webinar will demonstrate this integration and how to use SRA data in the Galaxy platform.  The webinar will be held on June 24, at Noon, Eastern US time (GMT -4).

**About SRA**

The [SRA](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/sra) is NIH's primary archive of high-throughput sequencing data and is part of the International Nucleotide Sequence Database Collaboration (INSDC) that includes the NCBI (and the Sequence Read Archive), the European Bioinformatics Institute (EBI), and the DNA Database of Japan (DDBJ). Data submitted to any of the three organizations are shared among them. The SRA is a superb resource for genomic data, [is now on the cloud on AWS and GCP](https://ncbiinsights.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/2020/02/24/sra-cloud/), and [is growing exponentially](https://trace.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/Traces/sra/sra.cgi?).

**About Galaxy**

Galaxy is a data integration and analysis platform for life science research.  It is free to use, open source, and is deployed at research organizations around the world.  Galaxy is supported by a worldwide community of developers, users, trainers, tool developers, and infrastructure providers.
