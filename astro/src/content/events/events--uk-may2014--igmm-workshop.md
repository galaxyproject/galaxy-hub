## Registration

Anyone affiliated with the IGMM can participate in this workshop.  To sign up for the course, please contact [Graeme Grimes of the Semple Lab](http://www.hgu.mrc.ac.uk/people/c.semple_researchb.html).

## Audience

Are you a life science researcher who needs to do complex analysis on large datasets?

Galaxy is an open, web-based platform for data intensive biological research that enables non-bioinformaticians to create, run, tune, and share their own bioinformatic analyses.

These hands-on workshops will teach participants how to integrate data, and perform simple and complex analysis within Galaxy. They will also cover data visualization and visual analytics, and how to share and reuse your bioinformatic analyses, all from within Galaxy.

No programming or Linux command line experience is required.
