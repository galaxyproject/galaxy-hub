## Want to plan a BoF?

To plan a Birds of a Feather meetup:

1. Create a web page for it.  You are encouraged to [create the page in this wiki](/events/gcc2013/bof/#create-your-bofs-wiki-page), but it can be any where.  If you want a wiki page, but don't want to learn how to edit this wiki, then send some text to \[Galaxy Outreach]\(mailto:outreach AT galaxyproject DOT org) and we'll create it for you.
2. Once the web page exists, add a link to it in the [Planned BoFs](/events/gcc2013/bof/#planned-bofs) section of this page.
3. Tweet it (use the hashtag #usegalaxy), or notify \[Galaxy Outreach]\(mailto:outreach AT galaxyproject DOT org).  In the near future there will also be a conference mailing list you can send an announcement to.
4. If you want, you can also [create a Galaxy News Item](/news/#add-a-news-item) about the BoF (or again, send the text to \[Galaxy Outreach]\(mailto:outreach AT galaxyproject DOT org).

## BoF Support

The conference will *enable and encourage* BoFs by

* Encouraging conference participants to organize BoFs
* Use this wiki page as a hub for BoFs at GCC2013.
* Promote BoFs to all conference participants, over and over, both before and during the conference ~~until everyone actually grows feathers~~.
* Identifying and coordinating spaces, both on-site and off, where BoFs can be held
