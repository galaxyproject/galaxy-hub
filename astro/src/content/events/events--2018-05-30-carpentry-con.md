The first [CarpentryCon](https://www.carpentrycon.org/) will be held in Dublin. CarpentryCon is the key community-building and networking event in The Carpentries' annual calendar of activities. This event will bring together newer and more experienced Carpentry community members to share knowledge, to network, to develop new skills, and to develop strategies for building strong local communities.

This conference will have four great keynote speakers:

* Valerie Aurora, a software engineer turned diversity and inclusion consultant
* Anelda van der Walt, the 2017 Community Service Award winner
* Greg Wilson, founder of Software Carpentry
* Professor Desmond Higgins, a bioinformatician who developed the Clustal package for multiple sequence alignment.

The Freiburg Galaxy team will participate as leader of the breakout session "Fostering FAIR Data and Sustainable Software Practices" and as helper during a Data Carpentry workshop.
