As with the first edition of Smörgåsbord, this will be a global 5-day Galaxy Training event showcasing a wide variety of Galaxy Training Network tutorials. This will be an online event, spanning all time zones. All training sessions are pre-recorded, so you can work through them at your own pace, and manage your own time. A large community of GTN trainers will be available via online support to answer all your questions.
