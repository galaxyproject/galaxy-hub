# Agenda

We'll talk about

* Progress since [GCC2014](/events/gcc2014/bofs/galaxy-training-network/)
* What should GTN emphasise moving forward?
* What ever issues participants want to cover.

Discussion before and after the meetup will happen on the [Galaxy-Training mailing list](https://lists.galaxyproject.org/lists/galaxy-training.lists.galaxyproject.org/).  If you aren't already on that list, you are encouraged to [join](https://lists.galaxyproject.org/lists/galaxy-training.lists.galaxyproject.org/).  It's pretty low volume.

# Audience

Anyone interested in using Galaxy for bioinformatics and related learning and teaching.  People who need to support such activities.  You do not need to be a member of GTN to participate in this BoF.

## Discussion

Compiled from the [Working Minutes for this BoF](http://bit.ly/gcc2015gtn) and Dave C's notes.

### Goals for GTN

* Make it easy to find trainers in particular geographies and research domains
* Make it easy for trainers to share and reuse other’s training materials
* Make it easy to share training best practices
* (linking training to practice?)

### Activity since GCC2014

* Create a galaxy-teach or galaxy-train mailing list / forum
  * Done
* Work with that list to establish what the Resource Directory (and the Trainer Directory) should look like
  * Resource Directory and Trainer Directory are up.
* Push these best practices to the GTN Best Practices area.
  * Done
  * But not particularly maintained
* Include a video training directory
* Publish Best practises: created
  * https://wiki.galaxyproject.org/Teach/BestPractices
  * But, not particularly maintained.
* Officially launched GTN in fall 2014.
* GTN joins GOBLET

### Training use cases

* Galaxy to teach bioinformatics
* Galaxy to teach using Galaxy
* Galaxy to teach developing on Galaxy

### Plans

* Migrating to new wiki platform, which we hope will make it much easier to manage and populate directories of material and trainers.

### What should GTN emphasise moving forward and Open Questions

* Should we have a one day meeting before/after GCC2016, or other event?  Or is it better to spend our “events about training” time elsewhere?

* Any idea how to raise visibility of, and contributions to resource and trainer directories, and to the best practices?  (And are these useful resources to maintain?)

* How else can GTN help the Galaxy Training Community?
  * Participants welcomed the idea of a Data Carpentry *Train the Trainer* workshop co-located with GCC2016
    * *Dave C will investigate*

### Other

* New repositories:
  * https://github.com/bgruening/training-material
  * https://github.com/bgruening/galaxy-tricks
  * Galaxy RNA workbench with test data and training material: https://github.com/bgruening/galaxy-rna-workbench-extra
  * Put training material in GitHub and use Software Carpentry model to manage materials?

* Platform for bioinformatics training:
  * all platforms have challenges
  * Most people in the room will use their own servers for training
  * tool packaging, tool cluster integration, best practise guidelines ...
    * IUC is actively developing guidelines … reusing it?
  * IPython and Interactive Environments as programming env
    * https://github.com/bgruening/galaxy-ipython
    * training in command line usage, scripting languages
  * A problem is matching the platform and tools to the tutorial. Often tutorials are specific to the Galaxy they were developed on.

* E-learning possibilities in Galaxy:
  * https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NOdym\_21M4o

* Best Practices
  * Training datasets
    * Need dirty data - people need classroom exposure to these.
  * Level of detail - go beyond defaults
  * Put errors in your workflows so students learn to deal with this.

* Developer Training
  * Simon and Bjorn do this.

* Licensing: CC-BY everything?

* WORKING groups on particular domains.  eg cancer, or plant or ..  Help address the training data generation problem.
