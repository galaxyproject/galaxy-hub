## Brisbane, Australia

Yes, we are going to Australia this year!
[Brisbane](https://www.visitbrisbane.com.au/) is the capital of the state of
Queensland in Australia. It is a large, modern city with a population of over
2.5 million people. Located on the east coast of Australia, Brisbane has a
subtropical climate with mild winters (which is when GCC2023 will be held
there). The city is known for its beautiful parks and gardens, including the
Brisbane Botanic Gardens, South Bank Parklands, the Lone Pine Koala Sanctuary,
and many more.

Brisbane is also home to a thriving arts and culture scene, with numerous
galleries, museums, and performance venues. There is a great choice of
restaurants and cuisines, including Australian, Asian, and Japanese food.

Within an hour drive are Australian Zoo, Moreton Island, and Gold Coast as some of
the prime Australian travel destinations, offering a range of activities and
attractions such as surfing, hiking, and wildlife encounters.

### Getting to Brisbane

Brisbane is well connected to the world with direct flights available from much
of the eastern Asia, west coast of North America, and the United Arab Emirates.
**The [Brisbane Airport](https://www.bne.com.au/) code is BNE.**

**Before making travel arrangements, don't forget to check any [visa
requirements](https://usa.embassy.gov.au/visa-requirements) for traveling to
Australia**. If you need a visa application letter from the conference, please
contact the [Organizers](/events/gcc2023/organizers/).

Also please check the [current COVID-19
requirements](https://www.homeaffairs.gov.au/covid19/entering-and-leaving-australia)
for entering and leaving Australia.

The airport is located approximately 13 kilometers (8 miles) from the city
center with [many options to get to the
city](https://www.bne.com.au/passenger/to-and-from/transport-options), with
[Airtrain](https://www.airtrain.com.au/catch-airtrain-to/brisbane-city/) being
our recommendation. For about $15, the train will drop you off in the city within 20
minutes. Check the
[map](https://www.airtrain.com.au/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/Airtrain-Network-Map.pdf)
for closest station to your hotel. For the conference venue, [station Brisbane
Central](https://goo.gl/maps/DLqWwxz5nF1yUX3d8) is closest.

If you will be arriving to Australia without a working cell service, it is a good
idea to save an offline map of Brisbane on your phone to ease navigation.

Technology](https://www.qut.edu.au/) (QUT) [Gardens Point

This is a beautiful location in the center of the city and right on the Brisbane
