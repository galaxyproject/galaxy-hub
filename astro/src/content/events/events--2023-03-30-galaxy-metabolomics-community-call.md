We will have some community updates followed by a presentation. Mélanie Petera from MetaboHUB Clermont will speak about “Workflow4Experimenters: feedback on a ‘bring your own data’ Galaxy-based training”. Afterwards we also have time for general updates and discussions. If you'd like to discuss particular topics, please add them to the [agenda](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1OrcpWJcHThn8eZd_eURnh1qybp3yetDd_NKtGvdfyjo/edit?usp=sharing) or bring them to the call!

**Please [join us via zoom](https://uni-freiburg.zoom.us/j/67535385558?pwd=Sy9TS0U1RUxHNVRxNjB3NmIyaTZRdz09) at 2 pm CET** ([see in your timezone](https://www.timeanddate.com/worldclock/fixedtime.html?msg=Galaxy+Metabolomics+Community+Call\&iso=20230330T14\&p1=980\&ah=1)) for an open discussion.
