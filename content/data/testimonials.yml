	- quote: "With 20 years of experience in research involving all sorts of bioinformatics, Galaxy remains the most intuitive and easily accessed resource for small to medium research projects making it ideal tool for all kinds of users from new students, MSc and PhD students to experience researchers without extensive bioinformatic experience. Also the tool is ideal for teaching how to approach bioinformatics as it provides strong tools, and computing while providing visible outputs. just excellent. "

	- quote: "Reproducible and sharable analysis to other researchers who do not have their own servers or budgets for cloud computing (particularly trainees!!!) We have taught Galaxy in our Big Data for Basic Scientists course for the last 4 years as it has been the most accessible resource with the most up to date tools, and it would be truly terrible to lose such access for developing biomedical trainees.   Even for me, a wet-lab basic scientist with bioinformatic tool development knowledge and experience, who can load up a powerful linux machine and/or cloud compute services, it is more cost-effective in terms of my time and expert staff time to utilize Galaxy, as configuring each tool and keeping it updated to be functional in an enormous effort, which the Galaxy team handles well.   I don't care if innovation is the #1 aspect of NIH grant reviews now, existing platforms including Galaxy NEED to remain supported just to keep it going, as it spurs innovation across other grants. If I were to pick the top two to keep NIH funded, it would be Galaxy and UCSC genome browser."

	- quote: "Previously, I relied on a company service for the bioinformatic analysis of RNA-seq data. While this approach provided results, it was expensive, inflexible, and offered limited control over the type of analysis performed or the ability to explore and interpret the data ourselves. I began using Galaxy relatively recently after discovering the training opportunities available through the community. Following the training, I was able to analyze my data independently, and I hope to publish the results obtained using Galaxy in the near future. Without the training provided by the community and the accessibility of tools on the Galaxy server, we would still be spending valuable resources on outsourced services, resources that could be better invested in our research."

		originalQuote: "Galaxy provided an easy way for me, someone with little coding and genomic analysis experience, to learn interactively bioinformatics, and carry out the analyses myself. Through Galaxy, I was able to identify mutants from my mutagenesis screen through a high-thruput method that involves whole genome sequencing. I was also able to learn and run RNAseq analysis pipeline myself. Later, I learned to deploy these programs locally. Without Galaxy, I would not be able to know where to even start. I also cannot remember how many times the Galaxy forum helped me. People there are enthusiastic and helpful.   Galaxy is crucial in my scientific training. It’s not just a collection of tools, but also a platform of education."
