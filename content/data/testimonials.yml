We have taught Galaxy in our Big Data for Basic Scientists course for the last 4 years as it has been the most accessible resource with the most up to date tools, and it would be truly terrible to lose such access for developing biomedical trainees.   Even for me, a wet-lab basic scientist with bioinformatic tool development knowledge and experience, who can load up a powerful linux machine and/or cloud compute services, it is more cost-effective in terms of my time and expert staff time to utilize Galaxy, as configuring each tool and keeping it updated to be functional in an enormous effort, which the Galaxy team handles well.   I don't care if innovation is the #1 aspect of NIH grant reviews now, existing platforms including Galaxy NEED to remain supported just to keep it going, as it spurs innovation across other grants. If I were to pick the top two to keep NIH funded, it would be Galaxy and UCSC genome browser."

Following the training, I was able to analyze my data independently, and I hope to publish the results obtained using Galaxy in the near future. Without the training provided by the community and the accessibility of tools on the Galaxy server, we would still be spending valuable resources on outsourced services, resources that could be better invested in our research."
