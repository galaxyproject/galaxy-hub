Galaxy is a free open platform designed to give researchers across the world unconstrained access to tools and infrastructure necessary for analysis of their data. Galaxy does a lot of things and contains many components, making it difficult to quickly comprehend everything that it can do. It also evolves [rapidly](https://docs.galaxyproject.org/en/master/releases/index.html). As a result, there are a number of misconceptions about what it is and what can (or cannot) be done with it. To spread the ultimate knowledge across the Universe, we are starting the **“Fighting Galactic Bullshit (FGBs)”** series (yes, we were definitely inspired by a certain [effort](https://www.callingbullshit.org/)). This series identifies the most common misconceptions and explains why they are, simply put, BULLSHIT! It will include the following “episodes”:

1. Galaxy is only useful for genome scientists…, **But, all scientists have genomes, right?**
2. Galaxy does not scale to large and complex problems…, **Define large and complex!**
3. Galaxy offers nothing to informaticians who can write their own code…, **Are you sure?**
4. Galaxy is hard to learn and hard to use…, **And bicycles are hard to park!**
5. Galaxy is only useful for teaching, not real science…, **Who are bigger snobs: teachers or scientists?**
6. Galaxy is neither popular with, nor widely used by real scientists…, **It depends on the meaning of the word “is”.**
7. Galaxy is free, so there cannot be professional support…, **Try contacting an airline!**
8. Galaxy is free, so there cannot be useful documentation…, **Have you ever assembled a wardrobe yourself?**
9. Galaxy cannot be sustainable in the long run, because no commercial organization is managing it…, **Yeah, for the past 15 years.**
