<blockquote class="blockquote">
This is just such devastating news. I have known James for the best part of seven years, as we set up Galaxy in Australia and James, of course, immediately agreed to visit in 2013 to help make that happen. He was visionary, looking to create free, open platforms for global science. <br /><br />
He was also enormously good company, going out for beers and in depth discussions on any and all topics. I thoroughly enjoyed James' company in social and academic forums...but far more importantly than that, he both led and built software and data science communities that will define community-focussed global bioscience from here on. <br /><br />
Personally, it's crushing - I am so sorry for his family and friends, of which of course I count myself - but the loss to the world of science eclipses that. We are all the poorer for losing James. If it is any consolation, he accomplished so much - the world of science is changed because of James.

Deeply saddened at the loss of James Taylor. I remember first reaching out to James at the start of my PhD. I had the great pleasure of rotating in his lab, which not only helped me develop my bioinformatic skills, but also ultimately set me on my career trajectory.

I owe a lot to James. In addition to happily agreeing to be on my thesis committee he was an immense source of knowledge and an overall great colleague. I’m grateful for having had the opportunity to work with him. James - you will be missed dearly.

My friend James Taylor is dead. I'm heartbroken and thinking of all of his family and friends. He is leaving a hole that cannot be filled.<br /><br />
I met James when I started grad school at Penn State. I had no idea what to expect (I'd only learned of PhD programs within the previous year). We were both students, but he was clearly in a league of his own.<br /><br />
James was one of the smartest people I've ever known, in a way that wasn't (as) intimidating. Talking with James was easy and enlightening. He advocated and put in the work for better science, in all aspects.<br /><br />
James supported my science and my career in ways I don't think I can ever fully communicate. As a colleague, he believed in me. As a friend, he expected me to do good. He supported my growth, selflessly.<br /><br />
Most of all, James was an advocate. <br /><br />
He advocated for his students, for trainees, for open science, for open data, for making this world a better place. <br /><br />

I will miss him so terribly.

<blockquote class="blockquote">
James was so approachable. Though we never got the chance to collaborate directly, when I first met *the* James Taylor I remember feeling that approachability in that someone so famous in our field would always take the time out to talk to me about science or about whatever the topic of the moment was. We had many conversations - some just a glance across a busy crowd at a conference where that would be our only acknowledgement, some,  hours long chats. The first memory that came to mind thinking back now was the many weeks he spent at CSHL instructing at courses in the fall. There were months when he was on campus more than I was. The particular memory that flashed when I heard this news was finishing a beer with him around 2 am in the cold outside the bar at Blackford. The bar had long closed, but we were having a crazy conversation along with one other course instructor about awful American TV shows. The conversation was of course punctuated with thoughts on comparative genomics. James was brilliant, but it wasn’t this that made him a star, helped him build a global community, or an enduring vision. He was a lovable and decent human being who will be fondly remembered. His work and the community he helped to create will live on. For every researcher who continues his legacy and works to live up to his achievements, don’t forget to bring along also his charm, curiosity, compassion, and love.

I was fortunate to be introduced to James via the IU/TACC Jetstream project, where he promised to consume large quantities of CPU time on behalf of the Galaxy project. His vision and his plans for achieving it were both straightforward and clear. In short: Give us a key to your system (an API key, in this case), and we will make sure it's used for good. And he delivered, spectacularly! While this straightforward approach might at first appear naive, he articulated his plans clearly and proved soundly that he could do it. He was always ready to share examples of discoveries that had been enabled by Galaxy. In later visits on other topics, I was impressed by his astute understanding of how the research community works and how to make (important, substantive) things happen. People like him are rare and special, and a joy to encounter and work with. This is a heavy loss for the research community.

James was a great force for openness, community, and science.  He was a truly lovely man. I first met him in Oslo in 2013 and he was immediately welcoming even though he had no idea who I was. Over the years that followed we shared beers, meals, conversations, games and laughs. The thing I'll most remember about him is the glint of pride he got in his eye whenever he saw the wonderful Galaxy community get together. He and Anton created something amazing.<br /><br />

I am still shocked by this. James was such a great person and scientist. I got to know him through the course at CSHL. In addition to being passionate about science, he was just as passionate about teaching and bringing computational biology to the masses.

09/06/2014 - Dr. James Taylor and I realized we had a mutual love for the Canadian show Trailer Park Boys at a happy hour post-bootcamp during my first week of grad school. His first email to me was to let me know the new season of TPB was on netflix. Will miss him greatly.

I worked with James Taylor from 2000-2002 when he was in Vermont. I got him into mountain biking and he turned me on to Modest Mouse. He was a wonderful human and the smartest person I've ever known. I am not surprised at the lives he's touched.

I met James over five years ago though the Galaxy Community, and I believe that his personality and role as co-founder helped shape that positive and welcoming atmosphere. Looking back it is clear that he and Anton convinced funders of the importance of community building, evident in how the Galaxy Project funded and has continued to fund dedicated staff for community, outreach and training. James cared both about people and principles - he was also vocal on open science and open data, embodied in the Galaxy platform's ethos of reproducible research. Just days ago, he was tweeting complaints about how in a pandemic so much new covid19 viral sequence data was not being shared openly (as in the NCBI/INSDC), but instead under restricted terms in the GISAID database. It is clear from the posts of his students, mentees, collaborators and friends, that while he would have achieved much more, he has already built a legacy we can all be proud of.

I am heartbroken.
When I think of James I remember him relaxing in the sun during one of the GCC hackathons. At the time I was attending as a lowly delegate from Africa, and engaging with a Galaxy project PI was quite a leap. We got talking and got to know each other over meetings and beers over the years. I cannot believe he is gone. His family and friends are left with a gaping hole in their lives. My strength to you (us) all.  Sincere condolences to James' family and everyone in the Galaxy community from SANBI and myself.

I remember James as embodying an uncompromising commitment to community-driven science to the point of making it feel like a family; how do we help each other to move science forward. It was noticeable in each conversation we had and this imprint he made will always stick with me. When you stop and think about how much scientific progress was made because he had a strong hand in breaking down silos and building global bridges, that impact is both lasting and expanding.

James was an incredibly kind teacher and friend.  You could tell he was truly passionate about teaching and building others up around him.  He cared deeply for his students and was willing to invest in anyone who wanted help.  It was clear he was truly passionate about making computational tools and skills accessible to as many people as possible and I suspect that this will be one of his greatest gifts to the world.<br /><br />

I still remember going up to James during one of his lectures and expressing that I was skeptical of many of the available bioinformatic tools.  I was a bit shocked when he replied, "You should be incredibly skeptical.  You should use most of them and trust none of them."   I really admired this intellectual honesty, how he was able to teach and rely on many tools while still being highly objective and critical of them.  That is something I will always remember about him and carry with me as a guiding principle in the years to come.<br /><br />

One of the privileges of being an academic is the opportunity to meet truly remarkable people, those who not only possess incredible intelligence but also incredible character.  James was undoubtedly one of those individuals and his passing is a true loss.

James was so helpful to various projects I've been involved in over the years. and lately he was a valuable voice of technical and educational experience in various NIH-driven projects.
