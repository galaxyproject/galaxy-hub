Mailing lists play a vital role in the Galaxy community:

1. **They complement the [Galaxy Help Forum](https://help.galaxyproject.org/) and Galaxy Chat channels.** If you prefer a forum or chat interface, then use those instead.
1. They are a key part of [Galaxy's overall support efforts](/support/).
1. They are a place where the community *[can ask and answer](/src/mailing-lists/index.md#posting-a-question)* questions.
1. They are a place for the discussion of open issues and best practices.
1. They are also a *[searchable treasure trove of knowledge about Galaxy](/src/mailing-lists/index.md#searching)*.  
1. Finally, they are a great way to learn what is going on in the Galaxy Community.

## New to Open Source Software Support Mailing Lists?

If you are brand new to programming mailing lists please read
**[How To Ask Questions The Smart Way by Eric Steven Raymond](http://www.catb.org/esr/faqs/smart-questions.html)** for practical tips on writing programming questions to this or any other open source mailing list. 

<span style="font-size: smaller;"> Hint for those too lazy to click: only you know useful information about the problem context such as the software packages and versions involved. A good question includes the bare minimum context detail, allowing someone who is skilled in the art and reading the list to understand the problem. </span>
