 abstract = {Ecological disasters, wars in regions with microbiological weapons depots, deforestation, domestication of wild animals, consumption of infected animals, contamination of water and food products and their components, experiments with viruses, deficiencies and other defects of the immune system in modern humans and other mammals became the impetus for the evolution of new dangerous and extremely dangerous viruses. Due to the emergence of new dangerous viruses, the importance and demand for knowledge and skills of computational biology, epidemiology and virology in modern society have increased. Modern sequencers are capable of producing large amounts of bioinformatic data that is represented in the form of genomic texts. Comparative сomputational analysis of this information is necessary to clarify the issues of phylogenesis, mutational profiling, molecular evolution, identification of insertions of other genomes, annotation of genome regions, search for targets for vaccine development and pharmacotherapy. In this сontext, authors conducted a computational experiment of comparative analysis of the genomic texts of Belarusian coronavirus samples against a number of selected complete genomes of dangerous and extremely dangerous viruses and coronaviruses of various origins. Data analysis was performed using the YASS, genomic texts were downloaded from the GISAID, the custom genomic data processing pipeline based on the Galaxy bioinformatics platform was also applied. The article presents the results of an analysis of the available scientific literature and the computational experiment comparing the genomic texts of Belarusian coronavirus samples with a number of selected complete genomes of dangerous and especially dangerous viruses and coronaviruses of various origin. A significant similarity of the new coronavirus with the recombinant coronavirus, as well as partial similarity with synthetic coronavirus, Rubella, Ebola 1976, HIV-2 (human immunodeficiency virus), Middle East respiratory syndrome, simian immunodeficiency and Marburg fever viruses have been found.},

 abstract = {Pseudomonas aeruginosa, recognized by the World Health Organization as a critical priority pathogen, exhibits significant genomic plasticity and a high potential for developing resistance to multiple antimicrobials. This study provides comprehensive genomic insights into colistin-resistant P. aeruginosa isolates obtained from cancer patients. Phenotypic assays were conducted to evaluate antibiotic susceptibility, biofilm formation, efflux pump activity, swarming motility, and pigment production. Whole genome sequencing of the collected isolates was performed using Oxford-Nanopore technology to examine sequence types, resistome profiles, virulence-associated genes, and mobile genetic elements. Our findings reveled that out of 52 isolates, 10 (19.2\%) were resistant to colistin. Ceftolozane/tazobactam demonstrated full efficacy against 60\% of colistin resistant P. aeruginosa isolates. Within this colistin resistant subset, high-risk clones ST308 and ST773 emerged as dominant, both harboring blaNDM-1 and exhibiting extensive resistance profiles, including resistance to colistin and, in some cases, ceftolozane/tazobactam. The first detection of ST1143 and ST1693 in Egypt carrying blaOXA-1028 and blaOXA-904, respectively was documented, neither of which had been previously reported in the country. The accessory genome, accounting for up to 34.6\% of the total genome, highlights the remarkable genomic plasticity of P. aeruginosa, and its capacity for horizontal acquisition of resistance and virulence genes via mobile genetic elements, such as integrative and conjugative elements (ICEs). Virulome analysis revealed the presence of the exoU gene in high-risk clones, a marker closely linked to hypervirulence in infection models, whereas other sequence types were associated with less virulent factors, such as exoS. Despite phenotypic variability in biofilm formation, pigment production, and motility, the underlying genetic determinants of these traits were highly conserved. Mutational analysis revealed mutations in the regulatory system PhoPQ as the primary mechanism of colistin resistance, with no mcr genes detected. In conclusion, the substantial genomic plasticity of P. aeruginosa, reflected by an extensive accessory genome facilitates horizontal gene transfer (HGT), and significantly influences antimicrobial resistance and virulence. Colistin resistance was predominantly mediated by chromosomal mutations. Virulome and resistome analyses underscores the high pathogenicity and resistance potential of high-risk clones ST773 and ST308. The detection of horizontally acquired elements, such as integrative and conjugative elements (ICEs) carrying resistance genes such as blaNDM-1, underscores their role in disseminating resistance determinants. These findings emphasize the need urgent for targeted antimicrobial stewardship and surveillance strategies within Egyptian healthcare settings.},

 abstract = {The endangered Peacock Softshell Turtle Nilssonia hurum (Gray, 1830) has undergone a steep population decline in recent decades because of habitat loss and anthropogenic pressures, highlighting the urgent need for scientific intervention to ensure its protection in the wild. Thus, the present study integrates mitogenomic and ecological data to guide proactive conservation strategies for this species. The study reports the first mitogenome (16,788 bp) of N. hurum from the upper Ganges region, which exhibits a typical gene composition and strong A + T bias. The mitogenome-based phylogenetic analyses reveal the monophyly of the genus Nilssonia Gray, 1872 and a close evolutionary relationship between N. hurum and N. nigricans (Anderson, 1875). The genetic distance and haplotype network analyses on the basis of the CYTB gene reveal substantial intraspecific diversity and spatial genetic structuring among populations across river basins within the easternmost range. Using species distribution modeling, the study identified 123,699 km2 (6.81\% of IUCN range) as presently suitable for N. hurum. However, future climate projections indicate drastic reductions in suitable habitat, with losses of up to 85\% due to climate change. The landscape genetic analyses revealed that the Meghna basin exhibits the highest mean functional connectivity (0.603), whereas the Brahmaputra basin shows the lowest connectivity (0.198) despite containing suitable habitat patches, consistent with its high genetic diversity. Moreover, projections under future climate scenarios, driven by anticipated losses in habitat suitability, indicate widespread declines in functional connectivity across all basins and sub-basins. The landscape geometry assessments further reveal increasing habitat fragmentation due to climate change. Therefore, populations persisting within suitable habitat patches across different river basins in the eastern range should be prioritized as distinct conservation units for future management. Overall, this study provides a critical foundation for site-specific conservation planning through landscape genetics to address habitat loss, fragmentation, and mitigating inbreeding depression for ensuring the long-term endurance of this threatened freshwater turtle in South Asia.},

 abstract = {The Tricarinate Hill Turtle (Melanochelys tricarinata), endemic to the Indian subcontinent, faces significant threats from intensifying anthropogenic pressures and severe habitat degradation. Thus, to facilitate conservation efforts for this endangered species, a comprehensive assessment of its genomics and ecology is imperative. The present study adopts two independent approaches by characterizing the complete mitogenome and evaluating current and future habitat suitability. The mitogenome (16,745 bp) comprises 37 genes, with most protein-coding genes beginning with the canonical ATG start codon. The codon usage analysis revealed that arginine, leucine, and serine are the most frequently used amino acids. The control region contains a termination-associated sequence, four conserved sequence blocks, and two distinct tandem repeat motifs. The phylogenetic assessment using both Bayesian inference and Maximum-likelihood methods consistently placed M. tricarinata in a distinct clade, separate from other geoemydids. The mitogenome-based TimeTree analysis revealed that M. tricarinata diverged from its closest relatives during the Oligocene. The comparative analyses of partial mitochondrial genes revealed substantial divergence between Melanochelys congeners (3.71–5.20\% in cox1, 7.99–9.29\% in cytb), with low haplotypic diversity in M. tricarinata and high in M. trijuga. The ensemble model identified suitable habitats under both current and future climate scenarios. Under present scenario, approximately 374,657 km2 of ideal habitat was delineated within the training extent with a mean corridor connectivity of 0.377, which was reduced to 238,039 km2 and mean connectivity of 0.518 when restricted to existing forest cover. Moreover, only 31,450 km2 of the suitable habitat for this species falls within Protected Areas, representing just 11.912\% of the total identified favorable area. The future projections suggest a potential reduction of up to 40\% in suitable habitat area due to climatic changes, accompanied by increased fragmentation, smaller patch sizes, and over 80\% decline in connectivity across future scenarios. Thus, this study provides comprehensive insights into the systematic position, evolutionary history and ecological requirements of M. tricarinata, offering a critical scientific foundation to guide effective conservation and management strategies for this imperiled species across its native range.},

 abstract = {As a key enzyme of the renin-angiotensin system (RAS), angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) is a validated receptor for SARS-CoV-2, linking RAS to COVID-19. Functional ACE1/ACE2 gene polymorphisms likely cause an imbalance in the ACE1/ACE2 ratio, triggering RAS imbalance and may contribute to COVID-19 complications. This study aimed to investigate four single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) of ACE1 and ACE2 genes, three for ACE1 (rs4343, rs4342, rs4341) and one for ACE2 (rs2285666), in patients with COVID-19 among the Palestinian population. A total of 130 blood samples were collected, including 50 negative controls without COVID-19 infection, 50 cases with COVID-19 infection but not hospitalized, and 30 patients with severe COVID-19 infection hospitalized in the intensive care unit. Fragments of the ACE1 and ACE2 genes, including the targeted SNPs, were amplified using multiplex PCR and subsequently genotyped by next-generation sequencing with specific virtual probes. Our results revealed that ACE2 rs2285666 GG genotype carriers were more prevalent in COVID-19 patients compared to the control group (P=0.049), while no statistical differences were observed in the distribution of ACE1 (rs4343, rs4342, rs4341) variants between COVID-19 patients and the control group. GA carriers of ACE2, rs2285666, among cases and ICU groups were at lower risk of getting COVID-19 infection (P=0.002 and P=0.013, respectively), and they were unlikely to develop fatigue (P=0.043), headache (P=0.007), loss of smell (P=0.028), and dyspnea (P=0.005). Age and comorbidities such as hypertension and coronary artery disease (CAD) were independent risk factors for COVID-19 disease. Symptoms of COVID-19 patients such as fatigue, headaches, runny noses, and loss of smell were significantly higher in non-hospitalized cases of COVID-19, while dyspnea was more frequent in the ICU patients. In conclusion, these findings indicate that the ACE2 rs2285666 GG genotype is associated with an increased risk of COVID-19 infection. This association suggests a potential genetic predisposition linked to the ACE2 gene, which may influence the susceptibility and severity of the disease.},

 abstract = {The calanoid copepod Acartia tonsa (Dana) has attracted interest because of its use as a copepod model organism as well as its potential economic role as live fish larval feed. While the adult genome and transcriptome of A. tonsa has been investigated, no studies have been performed investigating the genome-wide transcriptional changes during the normal subitaneous embryogenesis. Thus, the aim of the current study was to investigate said transcriptional changes throughout A. tonsa embryonic development. RNA extraction and de novo transcriptome assembly for the subitaneous embryogenesis of the copepod was conducted. The assembly includes for the first-time samples describing quiescent development and overall helps establishing a framework for future studies on the molecular biology of our species of interest. Among the findings reported, sequences annotated to well-known developmental genes, were identified. At the same time are described the molecular changes and gene expression levels throughout the entire 42 h the embryonic development lasts. In conclusion, here we present the most complete genome-wide transcriptional map of early copepod embryonic development to date, enabling further use of A. tonsa as a model organism for crustacean development.

 abstract = {Legumes house nitrogen-fixing endosymbiotic rhizobia in specialized polyploid cells within root nodules, which undergo tightly regulated metabolic activity. By carrying out expression analysis of transcripts over time in Medicago truncatula nodules, we found that the circadian clock enables coordinated control of metabolic and regulatory processes linked to nitrogen fixation. This involves the circadian clock-associated transcription factor LATE ELONGATED HYPOCOTYL (LHY), with lhy mutants being affected in nodulation. Rhythmic transcripts in root nodules include a subset of nodule-specific cysteine-rich peptides (NCRs) that have the LHY-bound conserved evening element in their promoters. Until now, studies have suggested that NCRs act to regulate bacteroid differentiation and keep the rhizobial population in check. However, these conclusions came from the study of a few members of this very large gene family that has complex diversified spatio-temporal expression. We suggest that rhythmic expression of NCRs may be important for temporal coordination of bacterial activity with the rhythms of the plant host, in order to ensure optimal symbiosis.},

 abstract = {Cobia (Rachycentron canadum) is a marine teleost species with great productive potential worldwide. However, the genomic information currently available for this species in public databases is limited. Such lack of information hinders gene expression assessments that might bring forward novel insights into the physiology, ecology, evolution, and genetics of this potential aquaculture species. In this study, we report the first de novo transcriptome assembly of R. canadum liver, improving the availability of novel gene sequences for this species. Illumina sequencing of liver transcripts generated 1,761,965,794 raw reads, which were filtered into 1,652,319,304 high-quality reads. De novo assembly resulted in 101,789 unigenes and 163,096 isoforms, with an average length of 950.61 and 1,617.34 nt, respectively. Moreover, we found that 126,013 of these transcripts bear potentially coding sequences, and 125,993 of these elements (77.3\%) correspond to functionally annotated genes found in six different databases. We also identified 701 putative ncRNA and 35,414 putative lncRNA. Interestingly, homologues for 410 of these putative lncRNAs have already been observed in previous analyses with Danio rerio, Lates calcarifer, Seriola lalandi dorsalis, Seriola dumerili, or Echeneis naucrates. Finally, we identified 7894 microsatellites related to cobia’s putative lncRNAs. Thus, the information derived from the transcriptome assembly described herein will likely assist future nutrigenomics and breeding programs involving this important fish farming species.},

@article{aerts_altered_2024,
 abstract = {Autism spectrum disorder (ASD) is a group of neurodevelopmental conditions associated with deficits in social interaction and communication, together with repetitive behaviours. The cell adhesion molecule protocadherin10 (PCDH10) is linked to ASD in humans. Pcdh10 is expressed in the nervous system during embryonic and early postnatal development and is important for neural circuit formation. In mice, strong expression of Pcdh10 in the ganglionic eminences and in the basolateral complex (BLC) of the amygdala was observed at mid and late embryonic stages, respectively. Both inhibitory and excitatory neurons expressed Pcdh10 in the BLC at perinatal stages and vocalization-related genes were enriched in Pcdh10-expressing neurons in adult mice. An epitope-tagged Pcdh10-HAV5 mouse line revealed endogenous interactions of PCDH10 with synaptic proteins in the young postnatal telencephalon. Nuanced socio-affective communication changes in call emission rates, acoustic features and call subtype clustering were primarily observed in heterozygous pups of a conditional knockout (cKO) with selective deletion of Pcdh10 in Gsh2-lineage interneurons. These changes were less prominent in heterozygous ubiquitous Pcdh10 KO pups, suggesting that altered anxiety levels associated with Gsh2-lineage interneuron functioning might drive the behavioural effects. Together, loss of Pcdh10 specifically in interneurons contributes to behavioural alterations in socio-affective communication with relevance to ASD.},

 abstract = {Long considered to be a consequence of human antibiotics use by deduction, antibiotic resistance mechanisms appear to be in fact a much older phenomenon as antibiotic resistance genes have previously been detected from millions of year-old permafrost samples. As these specimens guarantee the viability of archaic bacteria, we herein propose to apply the culturomics approach to recover the bacterial content of a Siberian permafrost sample dated, using the in situ-produced cosmogenic nuclide chlorine36 (36Cl), at 2.7 million years to study the dynamics of bacterial evolution in an evolutionary perspective. As a result, we cultured and sequenced the genomes of 28 ancient bacterial species including one new species. To perform genome comparison between permafrost strains and modern isolates we selected 7 of these species (i.e., Achromobacter insolitus, Bacillus idriensis, Brevundimonas aurantiaca, Janibacter melonis, Kocuria rhizophila, Microbacterium hydrocarbonoxydans and Paracoccus yeei). We observed a high level of variability in genomic content with a percentage of shared genes in the core genomes ranging from 21.23\% to 55.59\%. In addition, the Single Nucleotide Polymorphism (SNP) comparison between permafrost and modern strains for the same species did not allow a dating of ancient strains based on genomic content. There were no significant differences in antibiotic resistance profiles between modern and ancient isolates of each species. Acquired resistance to antibiotics was phenotypically detected in all gram-negative bacterial species recovered from permafrost, with a significant number of genes coding for antibiotic resistance detected. Taken together, these findings confirm previously obtained data that antibiotic resistance predates humanity as most of antimicrobial agents are natural weapons used in inter-microbial conflicts within the biosphere.},

 abstract = {Different effector arms of the immune system are optimized to protect from different classes of pathogens. In some cases, pathogens manipulate the host immune system to promote the wrong type of effector response-a phenomenon known as immune deviation. Typically, immune deviation helps pathogens to avoid destructive immune responses. Here, we report on a type of immune deviation whereby an opportunistic pathogen, Pseudomonas aeruginosa (P. aeruginosa), induces the type 2 immune response resulting in mucin production that is used as an energy source by the pathogen. Specifically, P. aeruginosa-secreted toxin, LasB, processed and activated epithelial amphiregulin to induce type 2 inflammation and mucin production. This "niche remodeling" by P. aeruginosa promoted colonization and, as a by-product, allergic sensitization. Our study thus reveals a type of bacterial immune deviation by increasing nutrient supply. It also uncovers a mechanism of allergic sensitization by a bacterial virulence factor.},

To access this biosynthetic potential for biotechnological applications, deeper insights into the biosynthetic pathways and corresponding gene clusters are necessary. Here we provide a comprehensive view of the biosynthetic gene clusters of all organisms comprising a lichen thallus: fungi, green algae, and bacteria. We present two high-quality PacBio metagenomes, in which we identified a total of 460 biosynthetic gene clusters.

The mycobionts contained mainly T1PKSs, followed by NRPSs, and terpenes; Trebouxia reads harbored mainly clusters linked to terpenes, followed by NRPSs and T3PKSs. Other lichen-associated ascomycetes and bacteria contained a mix of diverse biosynthetic gene clusters. In this study, we identified for the first time the biosynthetic gene clusters of entire lichen holobionts.

To reveal its genetic variation and population structure, microsatellite markers were developed and validated in four Greek populations. Methods and Results RNA-Seq data of the related species Arnebia euchroma and Echium plantagineum were assembled and mined to identify conserved ortholog sets containing simple sequence repeat motifs. Fifty potential loci were identified and then tested on A. tinctoria, of which 17 loci were polymorphic. The number of alleles ranged from one to nine, and the levels of observed and expected heterozygosity ranged from 0.000 to 1.000 and 0.000 to 0.820, respectively. Most of these loci could be successfully amplified in eight other species of Boraginaceae (Alkanna graeca, A. hellenica, A. sfikasiana, Echium vulgare, E. plantagineum, Lithospermum officinale, Borago officinalis, and Anchusa officinalis). Conclusions This study provides the first set of microsatellite loci for studying the genetic variation and population structure of A. tinctoria and shows their potential usefulness in other Boraginaceae species.},

 abstract = {Antimicrobial resistance is escalating among Staphylococcus species, which are major pathogens affecting both humans and animals. As therapeutic options continue to narrow, phage therapy is re-emerging as a promising strategy to combat resistant strains. In this study, we isolated from pig farm effluents a bacteriophage named CSF, infecting a Staphylococcus xylosus strain. The CSF phage demonstrated a broad host range, lysing mecA-positive, multidrug-resistant strains across nine species of the genera Staphylococcus and Mammaliicoccus. Notably, it also inhibited biofilm formation in strains that it could not infect directly, and this activity persisted at low virus concentrations and in combination with antibiotics. The phage maintained its lytic activity under extreme conditions of temperature, pH, and UV exposure, underscoring its resilience for practical use. Sequencing of the viral genome revealed that it is 140 kb in length and has a genetic composition consistent with a lytic lifestyle. Phylogenetic analysis showed that phage CSF is related to members of the family Herelleviridae that are found globally, suggesting a widespread distribution of related viral lineages. Importantly, the phage genome was found to lack bacterial virulence or antimicrobial resistance genes, suggesting its safety for biotechnological applications. Intergenomic comparisons indicated that CSF should be classified as a member of a new genus, expanding the known diversity of bacteriophages. These findings demonstrate potential of CSF for phage therapy and other biotechnological applications.},

Therefore, targeted reduction of arrhythmia represents a therapeutic approach for the prevention and treatment of severe events after infarction. Recent research transplanting mesenchymal stem cells (MSC) showed their potential in MI therapy. Our study aimed to investigate the effects of MSC injection on post-infarction arrhythmia. We used our murine double infarction model, which we previously established, to more closely mimic the clinical situation and intramyocardially injected hypoxic pre-conditioned murine MSC to the infarction border. Thereafter, various types of arrhythmias were recorded and analyzed. We observed a homogenous distribution of all types of arrhythmias after the first infarction, without any significant differences between the groups. Yet, MSC therapy after double infarction led to a highly significant reduction in simple and complex arrhythmias. Moreover, RNA-sequencing of samples from stem cell treated mice after re-infarction demonstrated a significant decline in most arrhythmias with reduced inflammatory pathways. Additionally, following stem-cell therapy we found numerous highly expressed genes to be either linked to lowering the risk of heart failure, cardiomyopathy or sudden cardiac death. Moreover, genes known to be associated with arrhythmogenesis and key mutations underlying arrhythmias were downregulated. In summary, our stem-cell therapy led to a reduction in cardiac arrhythmias after MI and showed a downregulation of already established inflammatory pathways. Furthermore, our study reveals gene regulation pathways that have a potentially direct influence on arrhythmogenesis after myocardial infarction.},

However, colistin is still widely used in intensive poultry production in Bangladesh. We aimed to investigate the dynamics and genetic diversity of colistin-resistant commensal Escherichia coli from broiler chickens. A total of 1200 E. coli strains were characterized from 20 broiler farms at three-time points along the production period. All strains were screened for mcr-1 to mcr-5 genes by a multiplex PCR, and their genetic diversity was measured by repetitive extragenic palindromic (REP)-PCR fingerprinting. Genomic diversity and characterization were performed by whole genome sequencing (WGS). Twenty-five percent of the commensal E. coli strains harbored mcr-1 genes. Frequency of mcr-1 gene detection correlated positively (odds ratio 1.71; 95\% CI 0.96–3.06; p = 0.068) with the use of colistin in poultry flocks. REP-PCR profiles and WGS analysis showed diverse E. coli population carrying multiple antimicrobial resistance genes. Phylogenetic comparison of mcr-1-bearing strains recovered from this study with a global strain collection revealed wide phylogenetic relationship. This study identified a high prevalence of mcr-1 gene among genetically diverse E. coli populations from broiler chickens in Bangladesh suggesting a massive horizontal spread of mcr-1 rather than by clonal expansion.},

 abstract = {Forkhead box G1 (FOXG1) has important functions in neuronal differentiation and balances excitatory/inhibitory network activity. Thus far, molecular processes underlying FOXG1 function are largely unexplored. Here, we present a multiomics data set exploring how FOXG1 impacts neuronal maturation at the chromatin level in the mouse hippocampus. At a genome-wide level, FOXG1 i) both represses and activates transcription, ii) binds mainly to enhancer regions, iii) reconfigures the epigenetic landscape through bidirectional alteration of H3K27ac, H3K4me3, and chromatin accessibility, and iv) operates synergistically with NEUROD1. Interestingly, we could not detect a clear hierarchy of FOXG1 and NEUROD1, but instead, provide the evidence that they act in a highly cooperative manner to control neuronal maturation. Genes affected by the chromatin alterations impact synaptogenesis and axonogenesis. Inhibition of histone deacetylases partially rescues transcriptional alterations upon FOXG1 reduction. This integrated multiomics view of changes upon FOXG1 reduction reveals an unprecedented multimodality of FOXG1 functions converging on neuronal maturation. It fuels therapeutic options based on epigenetic drugs to alleviate, at least in part, neuronal dysfunction.},

Therefore, the discovery of new xylanases has the potential to enhance efficiency and sustainability in many industries. Here, we report a xylanase with thermophilic character and superior biochemical properties for industrial use. The new xylanase is discovered in Anoxybacillus ayderensis as an intracellular xylanase (AAyXYN329) and recombinantly produced. While AAyXYN329 shows significant activity over a wide pH and temperature range, optimum activity conditions were determined as pH 6.5 and 65 °C.

Hanan Al-Jawabreh

Abstract
Background: Leishmaniasis is a vector-borne disease caused by protozoan parasite of the genus Leishmania. The infection is transmitted by bite of infected female sandflies of the genus Phlebotomus in the old world or Lutzomyia in the new world. The diagnosis is made by stained smear microscopy, in-vitro culture, and DNA-based detection methods.
Materials and Methods: In this study that spanned from 2016 to 2024 included patients from eleven districts in the West Bank of Palestine. The diagnostic methods used in the study included microscopy of Giemsa-stained touch smears, in-vitro culture using NNN medium, and ITS1-PCR. The amplicon-based next-generation sequencing of ITS1-219 was included in the comparison part of the study. The comparison arm of the study compared two groups, CL-confirmed group in w were positive by any of the tests used in the epidemiologic part of the study and a non-CL group which were negative by all diagnostic methods. The NGS1-219-PCR was compared to ITS1-PCR, which is considered as a gold standard owing to its superiority over microscopy and in-vitro culture.
Results: The positivity rate during the study period was 17\% (213/1262) with a prevalence of 7.0 per 100,000. The annual incidence rate 0.84 per 100,000 (25 cases per year) with approximately equal distribution between males (52\%) and females (48\%). The age range between 0 to 14 yrs was the most affected by CL. The CL lesions primarily affected the head (45\%), followed by the upper extremities (38\%) and the lower extremities (17\%).
The choropleth mapping showed that Jericho is still the district with highest annual incidence rate (21 per 100,000). The study revealed that Leishmania tropica is the predominating species with L. major restricted mainly to Jericho. The year 2017 was the last year to witness a CL peak in Palestine with Jericho contributing to 40\% of peak cases. More than half (52\%) of the cases appeared in the months of January to March. As for the comparison arm of the study, ITS1-219-NGS was shown to have a higher sensitivity of 94\% compared to the imperfect gold standard (ITS1-PCR) of 86\%. The agreement between the two tests was fair (Kappa-0.24) only agreed on 56\% of the cases only. Furthermore, the standard ITS1-PCR was unable to genotype 29 CL cases but were genotyped by ITS1-219-NGS and confirmed by BLAST search. Unlike the ITS1-PCR, imperfect gold standard, ITS1-219-NGS genotypes all its positive results correctly as confirmed by BLAST search. Moreover, 13 ITS1-PCR weak positive CL cases were found to be negative by ITS1-219-NGS and upon BLAST search shown to be contamination of human and bacterial origin.
Conclusion: Jericho area remains the main focus of CL in Palestine with L. tropica as the main species in the country and L. major restricted to Jericho area. Incidence rate has dropped compared to the two decades preceding this study as result of control measures implemented. Amplicon-based NGS is a feasible, highly sensitive, and high throughput diagnostic method with accurate species identification that can be used in clinical practice and epidemiologic survey.},

Software developers and researchers have developed hundreds of scientific workflow management systems so scientists in various domains can benefit from them by automating repetitive tasks, enhancing collaboration, and ensuring the reproducibility of their results. However, even for expert users, workflow creation is a complex task due to the dramatic growth of tools and data heterogeneity. Thus, scientists attempt to reuse existing workflows shared in workflow repositories. Unfortunately, several challenges prevent scientists from reusing those workflows. Thus, we first attempted to identify those reusability challenges in this study. We also offered an action list and evidence-based guidelines to promote the reusability of scientific workflows. Our intensive manual investigation examined the reusability of existing workflows and exposed several challenges. The challenges preventing reusability include tool upgrading, tool support unavailability, design flaws, incomplete workflows, failure to load a workflow, etc. Such challenges and our action list offered guidelines to future workflow composers to create better workflows with enhanced reusability. In the future, we plan to develop a recommender system using reusable workflows that can assist scientists in creating effective and error-free workflows.},

 abstract = {Water quality testing does not recognise antimicrobial resistance (AMR) and is often limited to indicators of faecal contamination Escherichia coli and Enterococcus species. In Europe, data on AMR in drinking water is scarce. In Ireland, as in many countries, household drinking water is supplied via mains or via private wells or water schemes. Using citizen science, we identified Irish private drinking water supplies as reservoirs of antimicrobial resistant bacteria (ARB). Gram-negative (n = 464) and Gram-positive (n = 72) bacteria were isolated. We identified instances of potentially opportunistic ARB such as Enterobacter cloacae, Acinetobacter baumannii and Enterococcus species. We report reservoirs of multidrug resistance in Enterococcus casseliflavus, E. cloacae, E. coli, Stenotrophomonas maltophilia, and Serratia rubidaea. We also identified linezolid-resistant Enterococcus in Irish drinking water. Linezolid is a last-resort antibiotic used to treat vancomycin-resistant Enterococcus sp. Additionally, we identified mobile AMR in three water samples, two of which were carried on IncF group, one on IncQ and five on Col-like plasmids. Our work suggests that private drinking water is a potential sink and source of AMR pathogens. This highlights a value of drinking water surveillance in a One Health framework as the surveillance would provide information regarding the movement and persistence of ARB and ARGs that are able to survive in drinking water and subsequently have the opportunity to be mobilised through humans; linking the environment to the human and potentially threatening human health.},

The association of aberrant DNA methylation with many diseases, as well as the increasing interest in modifying the methylation mark in a directed manner at genomic sites using epigenome editing for research and therapeutic purposes, increases the need for easy and efficient DNA methylation analysis methods. The standard approach to analyze DNA methylation with a single-cytosine resolution is bisulfite conversion of DNA followed by next-generation sequencing (NGS). In this chapter, we describe a robust, powerful, and cost-efficient protocol for the amplification of target regions from bisulfite-converted DNA, followed by a second PCR step to generate libraries for Illumina NGS. In the two consecutive PCR steps, first, barcodes are added to individual amplicons, and in the second PCR, indices and Illumina adapters are added to the samples. Finally, we describe a detailed bioinformatics approach to extract DNA methylation levels of the target regions from the sequencing data. Combining barcodes with indices enables a high level of multiplexing allowing to sequence multiple pooled samples in the same sequencing run. Therefore, this method is a robust, accurate, quantitative, and cheap approach for the readout of DNA methylation patterns at defined genomic regions.},

This study aimed to develop a comprehensive early life stage toxicity pathway model for the exposure of fish to estrogenic chemicals that is rooted in mechanistic toxicology. Embryo-larval fathead minnows (FHM; Pimephales promelas) were exposed to graded concentrations of 17α-ethinylestradiol (water control, 0.01\% DMSO, 4, 20, and 100 ng/L) for 32 days. Fish were assessed for transcriptomic and proteomic responses at 4 days post-hatch (dph), and for histological and apical end points at 28 dph. Molecular analyses revealed core responses that were indicative of observed apical outcomes, including biological processes resulting in overproduction of vitellogenin and impairment of visual development. Histological observations indicated accumulation of proteinaceous fluid in liver and kidney tissues, energy depletion, and delayed or suppressed gonad development. Additionally, fish in the 100 ng/L treatment group were smaller than controls. Integration of omics data improved the interpretation of perturbations in early life stage FHM, providing evidence of conservation of toxicity pathways across levels of biological organization. Overall, the mechanism-based embryo-larval FHM model showed promise as a replacement for standard adult live animal tests.},

Haemagogus mosquitoes, the primary sylvan vectors of MAYV are poorly characterized and a better understanding of the mosquito's viral transmission dynamics and interactions with MAYV and other microorganisms would be important in devising effective control strategies. In this study, a metatranscriptomic based approach was utilized to determine the prevalence of RNA viruses in field-caught mosquitoes morphologically identified as Haemagogus janthinomys from twelve (12) forest locations in Trinidad, West Indies. Known insect specific viruses including the Phasi Charoen-like and Humaiata-Tubiacanga virus dominated the virome of the mosquitoes throughout sampling locations while other viruses such as the avian leukosis virus, MAYV and several unclassified viruses had a narrower distribution. Additionally, assembled contigs from the Ecclesville location suggests the presence of a unique uncharacterized picorna-like virus. Mapping of RNA sequencing reads to reference mitochondrial sequences of potential feeding host animals showed hits against avian and rodent sequences, which putatively adds to the growing body of evidence of a potentially wide feeding host-range for the Haemagogus mosquito vector.},

However, the comprehensive molecular mechanisms of these effects are yet to be elucidated. The current study investigated the transcriptomic changes induced by seaweed extracts derived from Sargassum vulgare and Acanthophora spicifera on tomato and sweet pepper plants. Tomato and sweet pepper plants were subjected to foliar treatment with alkaline extracts prepared from the above seaweeds. Transcriptome changes in the plants were assessed 72h after treatments using RNA-sequencing. The treated plants were also analysed for defense enzyme activities, nutrient composition and phytohormonal profiles. The results showed the significant enrichment of genes associated with several growth and defense processes including photosynthesis, carbon and nitrogen metabolism, plant hormone signal transduction, plant-pathogen interaction, secondary metabolite metabolism, MAPK signaling, and amino acid biosynthesis. Activities of defense enzymes were also significantly increased in SWE-treated plants. Plant nutrient profiling showed significant increases in calcium, potassium, nitrogen, sulphur, boron, copper, iron, manganese, zinc, and phosphorous levels in seaweed-extract treated plants. Furthermore, the levels of auxins, cytokinins, and gibberellins were also significantly increased in the treated plants. In addition to these observed effects, were also significant disease reductions of bacterial leaf spot and early blight in SWE-treated plants coupled with an increase in chlorophyll content, plant growth, and fruit yield. The results demonstrated the complex effect of S. vulgare and A. spicifera extracts on the plants’ transcriptome and provide evidence of a strong role of these extracts in increasing plant growth responses while priming the plants against pathogenic attack simultaneously. The current study contributes to the understanding of the molecular mechanisms of seaweed extracts in plants and helps their usage as a viable organic input for sustainable crop production.},

 abstract = {Background
Enterococcus avium (E. avium) is a Gram-positive nosocomial pathogen that is commonly isolated from the alimentary tract. The objective of this functional genomics study was to identify the resistant genes by analyzing the genome of E. avium IRMC1622a, a type of bacteria found in feces collected from a patient at a Saudi Arabian tertiary hospital.
Methods
The bacterial strain IRMC1622a was identified by 16S rRNA sequencing as Enterococcus sp. The resistance phenomics were performed using VITEK® 2, and morphological analysis was achieved using a scanning electron microscope (SEM). Finally, the whole bacterial genome of the bacterial strain IRMC1622a was subjected to sequencing during October 2023 using Oxford Nanopore long-read sequencing technology, and mining for resistant genes.
Results
The results of antimicrobial resistant phenomics indicated that the IRMC1622a strain was sensitive to all tested antimicrobial agents except for erythromycin, and the same result was confirmed by genomic analysis in addition to other classes of antibiotics. SEM showed E. avium IRMC1622a is ovoid shape, in single cells (L 1.2797 ± 0.1490µm), in pairs (L 1.7333 ± 0.1054µm), and in chains (L 2.44033 ± 0.1978 µm). The E. avium IRMC1622a genome has 14 (in CARD) antimicrobial resistance genes that were identified with several mechanisms of antimicrobial resistance, such as the efflux pump and conferring antibiotic resistance. The present study revealed that the E. avium IRMC1622a genome contains a high number of genes associated with virulence factors, and 14 matched pathogenic protein families and predicted as human pathogen (probability score 0.855). We report two (ISEnfa4 and ISEfa5) mobile genetic elements for the first time in the E. avium genome.
Conclusions
The study concludes that E. avium IRMC1622a is susceptible to all tested antibacterials except erythromycin. The IRMC1622a has 14 genes encoding antimicrobial resistance mechanisms, including the efflux pump and conferring antibiotic resistance. This could indicate a potential rise in E. avium resistance in healthcare facilities. These observations may raise concerns regarding E. avium resistance in healthcare. We need more research to understand the pathophysiology of E. avium, which leads to hospital-acquired infections.},

 abstract = {The mitochondrial genomes of plants are large, with the majority ranging between 500 and 800 kb. However, the mitochondrial genomes of Cyperaceae (sedges) species were found to be much larger, exceeding 1 Mb in size. Here, we aimed to investigate the gigantism of the mitochondrial genomes of three Rhynchospora (beak-sedges) species and one related species of the sister family Juncaceae, the common rush (Juncus effusus).Long PacBio HiFi reads were sequenced and assembled using Hifiasm software. The mitochondrial genomes were annotated using Geneious and Mitofy software. Transposable elements were annotated using DANTE and RepeatModeler pipelines, and gene prediction in intergenic regions was conducted using Augustus. The predicted genes were annotated using BLAST and gene ontology terms.The mitogenome of R. breviuscula was 2,222,920 bp, that of R. pubera was 2,064,773 bp, that of R. tenuis was 1,678,054 bp, and that of the species of J. effusus was 553,985 bp. The results revealed giant intergenic spaces in all Rhynchospora, containing predicted nuclear genes and LTR retrotransposons. BLASTn revealed a high migration of DNA from the nucleus to the mitogenome.Our findings show that the Rhynchospora mitogenome is the largest among the monocotyledons. These mitogenomes feature giant intergenic spaces, incorporation of chloroplast DNA and numerous rearrangements. Gigantism of the intergenic spaces is associated with the movement of nuclear DNA segments, suggesting a mechanism of DNA transfer from the nuclear genome to the mitochondrial genome.},

 abstract = {Does endometriosis-associated infertility (E) change the microRNA (miRNA) profile of cumulus cells (CCs) with a differential footprint between fertilized oocytes and oocytes that failed fertilization?The CCs miRNA profile is altered in E versus control (C) patients (male/non-hormonal causes), with a differential signature between oocytes with successful or failed fertilization.For E patients, ART are often considered as an option to achieve successful pregnancy. But the impact of E on oocyte quality and its potential to be fertilized are still under debate with very few molecular clues supporting clinical data. Endometriosis causes alterations in gene expression in oocytes and CCs, but little is known about the changes at miRNA level. MicroRNAs are small non-coding RNAs with an important role in gene regulation. They are active players in oocyte maturation and fertilization, have been pointed as diagnostic biomarkers of E and thus, making them promising biomarkers of oocyte quality in E.Thirty-six CCs from metaphase II oocytes from 33 patients, i.e., 15 E patients and 18 C patients (11 male, 7 non-hormonal factors) undergoing ART between 2019-2023 at the University Hospital Zurich were analyzed. CCs samples were retrospectively classified into: 1) E patients with fertilized oocytes (2PN) (n = 11; E2); 2) E patients with oocytes that failed fertilization (0PN) (n = 4; E0); 3) C patients with 2PN oocytes (n = 12; C2); 4) C patients with 0PN oocytes (n = 7; C0).Small RNA-sequencing was performed for 36 single CCs samples. RNA-seq data was analyzed using the Galaxy Europe server (usegalaxy.eu) and differential expression analysis was performed with the Bioconductor R package EdgeR. The differential abundance of two miRNAs, miR-143-3p and miR-10b-5p, was further validated in 24 remaining samples by qPCR. MIENTURNET was used to identify miRNA target genes and DAVID and KEGG pathway databases to examine biological functions and pathways associated to the predicted target genes.Ninety-nine differential abundant (DA) miRNAs were identified between E and C patients (false discovery rate, FDR \&lt;5\%). Regardless the disease/health status, 31 miRNAs were DA between 2PN and 0PN oocytes (FDR \&lt;20\%). In E patients, 27 DA miRNAs were found between E2 and E0 oocytes (FDR \&lt;5\%). In C patients, 15 DA miRNAs were found between C2 and C0 oocytes (FDR \&lt;5\%). Around 60\% of the DA miRNAs in CCs from E versus C comparison have been found in endometrium or plasma samples from E patients. Comparisons among identified DA miRNAs revealed three sets of miRNAs: 1) affected only by E, 2) affected by both E and the potential to be fertilized; and 3) reporting a E2 miRNA signature in CCs of E patients but still with the potential to be fertilized. Target genes of DA miRNAs were involved in known biological functions and pathways affected by E, e.g.: oxidative stress, calcium signaling, mitochondria and spindle alterations, embryo development, estrogen signaling, and TGF-beta pathway. Interestingly, 11 DA miRNAs identified in set 1 - unique to E, and 3 DA miRNAs in set 3 - reflecting E2 oocyte signature, target 39 and 32 genes involved in progesterone-mediated oocyte maturation pathway, respectively.The sample size of the study cannot be considered as large, with a particular small group of E patients with 0PN oocytes compared to the other experimental groups. We cannot rule out that other unknown individual genetic or clinical factors may have influenced the reported results.Our findings can inspire new diagnosis approaches and personalized treatments with therapeutic miRNAs for underexpressed miRNAs or with miRNA inhibitors for miRNAs overexpressed in CCs of oocytes from E patients. The potential applications can be of value to E patients with low number and poor quality of oocytes retrieved.No},

 abstract = {\&lt;h4\&gt;Background\&lt;/h4\&gt;Endometriosis (E) is multifactorial disease affecting around 10\% of women worldwide. The association between E and infertility is clinically well recognized. For E patients to achieve a successful pregnancy, assisted reproductive technologies (ART) are considered as a treatment option. However, the impact of E on oocyte quality, its potential to be fertilized as well as pregnancy rates, is still under debate and with very few molecular clues explaining the clinical data. Alterations in protein-coding RNAs in cumulus cells (CCs), cells surrounding the oocytes and contributing to oocyte maturation, have been reported in E patients. But there is a lack of information regarding microRNAs (miRNAs), which control protein translation. Thus, we aimed: (1) to identify altered miRNA expression in CCs of E patients versus patients without the disease (control, C); and (2) to unveil if in E patients, CCs from fertilized oocytes display a different miRNA profile versus oocytes that failed fertilization. Small RNA-sequencing was performed on CCs from patients undergoing ART.\&lt;h4\&gt;Results\&lt;/h4\&gt;A total of 85 differentially expressed (DE) miRNAs were identified in E versus C patients (FDR \&lt; 0.05). In E patients, 25 DE miRNAs were found between fertilized oocytes and oocytes that failed fertilization, while 13 DE miRNAs in C patients (FDR \&lt; 0.05). Comparisons among DE miRNAs highlighted three notable miRNA sets: Set (1) 35 DE miRNAs specific to E; Set (2) 27 DE miRNAs affected by both E and the potential to be fertilized; and Set (3) 6 DE miRNAs characteristic of a competent oocyte successfully fertilized despite the disease. Target gene analysis of DE miRNAs unveiled genes involved in oocyte meiosis, progesterone-mediated oocyte maturation pathway, embryo development, mitochondria and spindle alterations, calcium signaling, and oxidative stress.\&lt;h4\&gt;Conclusion\&lt;/h4\&gt;This study identified for the first time an altered miRNA signature in CCs of E patients, pointing towards compromised oocyte competence. Besides, in E patients, a characteristic CCs miRNA footprint for oocytes that can be successfully fertilized despite the disease has been revealed. The study charts new territory for non-invasive diagnosis and personalized treatments based on miRNAs to improve oocyte competence in E patients under ART treatments.},

 abstract = {Micronutrient deficiencies, such as manganese (Mn), pose significant global health risks, affecting millions of people worldwide and leading to serious health conditions. Biofortifying crops, notably common beans, offer a sustainable solution to combat these deficiencies. This study aimed to uncover the genetic basis associated with Mn content in Turkish common bean (Phaseolus vulgaris) germplasm through a genome-wide association study (GWAS), which is crucial for developing nutrient-rich bean varieties. Here, we examined variation among 183 common bean accessions, collected from 19 provinces of Turkey and identified the genetic basis linked to seed Mn content. Genotype by environment interaction significantly influenced Mn content (p {\textless} 0.05). The mean Mn content was observed 31.69 mg kg−1 across the germplasm. Bingol-16 had the lowest, while Malatya-59 had the highest Mn contents. Stability analysis was performed using the ‘STABILITYSOFT’ method and found 10 stable accessions. The cluster constellation plot was generated using JMP statistical software. A total of 7900 DArTseq markers were used for association analysis, identifying 16 markers across four chromosomes (Pv2, Pv5, Pv7 and Pv11). Notably, markers DArT-3374915 and DArT-3375187 exhibited consistent associations across different environments, making them promising candidates for Mn-focused breeding programmes. Gene annotation and interactome analysis, including BLAST searches and protein–protein interaction analysis, revealed associations of candidate genes with Mn concentration regulation, shedding light on potential mechanisms underlying Mn accumulation in common beans. Our findings lay a foundation for marker-assisted breeding efforts in common bean improvement.},

So far, specific PCR-based detection and identification tests for X. translucens pathovars are not available. In this study, we used comparative genomics approach to design a pathovar-specific primer pair for detection of X. translucens pv. undulosa in naturally infected seeds and its differentiation from other pathovars of the species. For this aim, complete genome sequences of strains of different X. translucens pathovars were compared and the specific PCR primer pair XtuF/XtuR was designed. These primers were strictly specific to X. translucens pv. undulosa as the expected 229 bp DNA fragment was not amplified in the closely-related pathovars nor in other xanthomonads, wheat pathogenic bacteria, and other plant pathogenic bacteria. High sensitivity of the primer pair XtuF/XtuR allowed detection of pure DNA of the pathogen in a concentration as low as 4.5 pg/µl. The pathogen was also detected in water suspension at a concentration of 8.6 × 102 cfu/ml. The PCR test was capable of detecting the pathogen in extracts of naturally infected wheat seeds at a concentration of 3.5 × 104 cfu/g while culture plate method was able to detect the pathogen at a concentration of 50 × 105 cfu/g of the same seeds. The PCR test developed in this study is a step forward for precise detection and identification of X. translucens pv. undulosa to prevent outbreaks of the bacterial leaf streak disease.},

Information about the epigenetic regulators within the Fagaceae, a relevant family of trees and shrubs of the northern hemisphere ecosystems, is scarce. With the intent to characterize these proteins in Fagaceae, we searched for orthologs of DNA methyltransferases (DNMTs) and demethylases (DDMEs) and Histone modifiers involved in acetylation (HATs), deacetylation (HDACs), methylation (HMTs), and demethylation (HDMTs) in Fagus, Quercus, and Castanea genera. Blast searches were performed in the available genomes, and freely available RNA-seq data were used to de novo assemble transcriptomes. We identified homologs of seven DNMTs, three DDMEs, six HATs, 11 HDACs, 32 HMTs, and 21 HDMTs proteins. Protein analysis showed that most of them have the putative characteristic domains found in these protein families, which suggests their conserved function. Additionally, to elucidate the evolutionary history of these genes within Fagaceae, paralogs were identified, and phylogenetic analyses were performed with DNA and histone modifiers. We detected duplication events in all species analyzed with higher frequency in Quercus and Castanea and discuss the evidence of transposable elements adjacent to paralogs and their involvement in gene duplication. The knowledge gathered from this work is a steppingstone to upcoming studies concerning epigenetic regulation in this economically important family of Fagaceae.},

This study provides an in-depth look into the distribution and variety of prophages in Latilactobacillus curvatus (L. curvatus). This species is found in a wide variety of ecological niches and is routinely used as a meat starter culture., 
Methods: Fourty five L. curvatus genomes were screened for prophages. The intact predicted prophages and their chromosomal integration loci were described. Six L. curvatus lysogens were analysed for phage-mediated lysis post induction via UV light and/or mitomycin C. Their lysates were analysed for phage particles via viral DNA sequencing and transmission electron microscopy., 
Results: Two hundred and six prophage sequences of any completeness were detected within L. curvatus genomes. The 50 as intact predicted prophages show high levels of genetic diversity on an intraspecies level with conserved regions mostly in the replication and head/tail gene clusters. Twelve chromosomal loci, mostly tRNA genes, were identified, where intact L. curvatus phages were integrated. The six analysed L. curvatus lysogens showed strain-dependent lysis in various degrees after induction, yet only four of their lysates appeared to contain fully assembled virions with the siphovirus morphotype., 
Conclusion: Our data demonstrate that L. curvatus is a (pro)phage-susceptible species, harbouring multiple intact prophages and remnant sequences thereof. This knowledge provides a basis to study phage-host interaction influencing microbial communities in food fermentations.},

Both species shared a common gene pool representing 2884 genes out of a total 3244 genes. SNP-based phylogenetic analysis indicated higher SNP diversity among B. melitensis (3824) strains in comparison to B. abortus (540) strains, and a clear demarcation was identified between standard/vaccine and field strains. The analysis for virulence genes revealed that virB3, virB7, ricA, virB5, ipx5, wbkC, wbkB, and acpXL genes were highly conserved in most of the Brucella strains. Interestingly, virB10 gene was found to have high variability among the B. abortus strains. The cgMLST analysis revealed distinct sequence types for the standard/vaccine and field strains. B. abortus strains from north-eastern India fall within similar sequence type differing from other strains. In conclusion, the analysis revealed a highly shared core genome among two Brucella species. SNP analysis revealed B. melitensis strains exhibit high diversity as compared to B. abortus strains. Strains with absence or high polymorphism of virulence genes can be exploited for the development of novel vaccine candidates effective against both B. abortus and B. melitensis.},

 abstract = {Natural ecosystems can become significant reservoirs and/or pathways for antimicrobial resistance (AMR) dissemination, with the potential to affect nearby microbiological, animal, and ultimately human communities. This is further accentuated in environments that provide direct human exposure, such as drinking water. To date, however, few studies have investigated AMR dissemination potential and the presence of co-selective stressors (e.g., metals/metalloids) in groundwater environments of human health significance. Accordingly, the present study analysed samples from rural (drinking) groundwater supplies (i.e., private wells) in the Republic of Ireland, where land use is dominated by livestock grazing activities. In total, 48 Escherichia coli isolates tested phenotypically for antimicrobial susceptibility in an earlier study were further subject to whole genome sequencing (WGS) and corresponding water samples were further analysed for trace metal/metalloid concentrations. Eight isolates (i.e., 16.7\%) were genotypically resistant to antimicrobials, confirming prior phenotypic results through the identification of ten antimicrobial resistance genes (ARGs); namely: aph(3″)-lb (strA; n=7), aph(6)-Id (strA; n = 6), blaTEM (n = 6), sul2 (n = 6), tetA (n = 4), floR (n = 2), dfrA5 (n = 1), tetB (n = 1), and tetY (n = 1). Additional bioinformatic analysis revealed that all ARGs were plasmid-borne, except for two of the six sul2 genes, and that 31.2\% of all tested isolates (n = 15) and 37.5\% of resistant ones (n = 3) carried virulence genes. Study results also found no significant relationships between metal concentrations and ARG abundance. Additionally, just one genetic linkage was identified between ARGs and a metal resistance gene (MRG), namely merA, a mercury-resistant gene found on the same plasmid as blaTEM, dfrA5, strA, strB, and sul2 in the only isolate of inferred porcine (as opposed to bovine) origin. Overall, findings suggest that ARG (and MRG) acquisition may be occurring prior to groundwater ingress, and are likely a legacy issue arising from agricultural practices.},

However, it recently emerged as an opportunistic human pathogen. To date, the source of {\textless}italic{\textgreater}D. tsuruhatensis{\textless}/italic{\textgreater} infection is not clear. The majority of studies of {\textless}italic{\textgreater}D. tsuruhatensis{\textless}/italic{\textgreater} have focused on environmental or clinical strains, while investigations of {\textless}italic{\textgreater}D. tsuruhatensis{\textless}/italic{\textgreater} strains isolated from food sources are limited. In the present study, we report the case of {\textless}italic{\textgreater}D. tsuruhatensis{\textless}/italic{\textgreater} isolation from raw bovine milk. Classical bacteriology approaches, as well as next-generation sequencing and comparative genomics, were used to characterize the features of the {\textless}italic{\textgreater}D. tsuruhatensis{\textless}/italic{\textgreater} MR-6/3H strain. The MR-6/3H strain was resistant to 19 antimicrobials among 23 tested, including all aminoglycosides, phenicol, trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole, and almost all β-lactams. Phylogenetically, the MR-6/3H was close to clinical origin strains, including those previously isolated in Russia. Comparative genomics revealed the presence of putative antimicrobial resistance genes in the MR-6/3H isolate, mostly associated with efflux systems. Notably, genus-specific OXA-926-like β-lactamase was also detected. In all, 27 putative virulence factors were predicted, the majority of which were associated with motility, adherence, stress survival, siderophore synthesis, and immunomodulation. In the MR-6/3H genome, the five prophage regions were identified, including two with intact levels. Integrons and CRISPR-Cas systems were not detected in the MR-6/3H isolate. Thus, our findings suggest that raw milk can be the potential source of and transmission route for the dissemination of multidrug-resistant {\textless}italic{\textgreater}D. tsuruhatensis{\textless}/italic{\textgreater}.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

 abstract = {The bacterial foodborne enteropathogen Escherichia albertii, despite enjoying increased attention paid to its pathogenesis, global dissemination, and antimicrobial resistance capacity, remains difficult to identify from human foods. The primary objective of this study was to develop and test a selective and differential plating medium for the isolation of E. albertii from enteric pathogens commonly transmitted via fresh poultry meat, namely E. coli and Salmonella enterica. MacConkey agar supplemented with α-D-+-melibiose and the lactose analogue X-gal was prepared and used to differentially enumerate E. albertii, Salmonella, and E. coli from inoculated ground chicken meat. The medium, MXgMac agar, differentiated the inoculated pathogens with a greater degree of efficiency than did the previously developed E. albertii-selective medium xylose–rhamnose–melibiose (XRM) MacConkey agar, based on differential usage of the lactose analogue and melibiose. Chicken-derived feces and litter samples were subsequently tested using the medium and found not to contain E. albertii by 16S rRNA gene amplification. MXgMac agar facilitates improved differential recovery of E. albertii and other enteric pathogens from poultry meat versus other E. albertii selective/differential media.},

 abstract = {Bali cattle, domesticated from wild banteng (Bos javanicus), represent Indonesia’s valuable indigenous genetic resource. A detailed mitochondrial genome (mitogenome) sequence of Bali cattle is essential for population genetic studies and supporting sustainable breeding. This study aimed to assemble the complete mitogenome sequence of Bali cattle, characterize its genetic features, and investigate its phylogenetic position within the Bos genus. High-molecular-weight genomic DNA was extracted from a male Bali cattle blood, and mitogenome sequencing was conducted using long-read Oxford nanopore sequencing by combining adaptive sampling (NAS) and amplicon-based approaches. Both NAS and amplicon-based approaches can assemble a complete mitogenome sequence of Bali cattle. However, amplicon-based gives better accuracy and completeness. The complete mitogenome of Bali cattle spans 16,387 bp, comprising 13 PCGs, 22 transfer RNA (tRNA) genes, two ribosomal RNA (rRNA) genes, and a non-coding control region (CR), which showed similar structure observed in other Bos species. Phylogenetic analysis revealed that Bali cattle are grouped within the same clade as the B. javanicus species, with the closest relationship to Javan banteng (B. j. javanicus). Interestingly, a unique tandem repeat motif was exclusively identified in the CR of B. j. javanicus, including Bali cattle. This study offers novel insights into the comprehensive mitogenomic architecture of Bali cattle. Furthermore, discovering a unique tandem repeat motif offers potential as a marker for Bali cattle identification and its applications in forensic and product authentication.},

 abstract = {This study used metagenomic analysis to investigate the gut microbiota and resistome in piglets that were or were not challenged with enterotoxigenic Escherichia coli (ETEC) and had or had not received dietary supplementation with microencapsulated probiotics. The 72 piglets belonged to six groups that were either non-ETEC challenged (groups 1-3) or ETEC challenged (receiving 5ml of 109 CFU/ml pathogenic ETEC strain L3.2 one week following weaning at three weeks of age: groups 4-6). On five occasions at 2, 5, 8, 11, and 14 days of piglet age, groups 2 and 5 were supplemented with 109 CFU/ml of multi-strain probiotics (Lactiplantibacillus plantarum strains 22F and 25F, and Pediococcus acidilactici 72N) while group 4 received 109 CFU/ml of P. acidilactici 72N. Group 3 received 300mg/kg chlortetracycline in the weaner diet to mimic commercial conditions. Rectal faecal samples were obtained for metagenomic and resistome analysis at 2 days of age, and at 12 hours and 14 days after the timing of post-weaning challenge with ETEC. The piglets were all euthanized at 42 days of age. The piglets in groups 2 and 5 were enriched with several desirable microbial families, including Lactobacillaceae, Lachnospiraceae and Ruminococcaceae, while piglets in group 3 had increases in members of the Bacteroidaceae family and exhibited an increase in tetW and tetQ genes. Group 5 had less copper and multi-biocide resistance. Mobile genetic elements IncQ1 and IncX4 were the most prevalent replicons in antibiotic-fed piglets. Only groups 6 and 3 had the integrase gene (intl) class 2 and 3 detected, respectively. The insertion sequence (IS) 1380 was prevalent in group 3. IS3 and IS30, which are connected to dietary intake, were overrepresented in group 5. Furthermore, only group 5 showed genes associated with detoxification, with enrichment of genes associated with oxidative stress, glucose metabolism, and amino acid metabolism compared to the other groups. Overall, metagenomic analysis showed that employing a multi-strain probiotic could transform the gut microbiota, reduce the resistome, and boost genes associated with food metabolism.},

 abstract = {Strains belonging to the Weissella genus are frequently recovered from spontaneously fermented foods. Their functional, microbial-modulating, and probiotic traits enhance not only the sensorial properties but also the nutritional value, beneficial effects, and safety of fermented products. Sporadic cases of opportunistic pathogenicity and antibiotic resistance have deprived safety status from all Weissella species, which thus remain understudied. Our study increased the number of available high-quality and taxonomically accurate W. paramesenteroides genomes by 25\% (9 genomes reported, leading to a total of 36 genomes). We conducted a phylogenetic and comparative genomic analysis of the most dominant Weissella species (W. cibaria, W. paramesenteroides, W. viridescens, W. soli, W. koreensis, W. hellenica and W. thailadensis). The phylogenetic tree corroborated species assignment but also revealed phylogenetic diversity within the Weissella species, which is likely related to the adaptation of Weissella in different niches. Using robust alignment criteria, we showed the overall absence of resistance and virulence genes in Weissella spp., except for one W. cibaria isolate carrying blaTEM-181. Enrichment analysis showed the association of Weissella species several CAZymes, which are essential for biotechnological applications. Additionally, the combination of CAZyme metabolites with probiotics can potentially lead to beneficial effects for hosts, such as the inhibition of inflammatory processes and the reduction of cholesterol levels. Bacteriocins and mobile genetic elements MGEs (Inc11 plasmid and ISS1N insertion sequence) were less abundant, however W. thailadensis and W. viridescens showed significant association with specific bacteriocin-encoding genes. Lastly, an analysis of phenotypic traits underlined the need to carefully evaluate W. cibaria strains before use as food additives and suggested the possibility of employing W. paramesenteroides and W. hellenica in the fermentation process of vegetable products. More studies providing high-resolution characterization of Weissella strains from various sources are necessary to elucidate the safety of Weissella spp. and exploit their beneficial characteristics.},

 abstract = {Dairy products play a crucial role in human nutrition as they provide essential nutrients. However, the presence of diverse microorganisms in these products can pose challenges to food safety and quality. Here, we provide a comprehensive molecular characterization of a diverse collection of lactic acid bacteria (LAB) and staphylococci isolated from raw sheep’s milk. Whole-genome sequencing, phenotypic characterization, and bioinformatics were employed to gain insight into the genetic composition and functional attributes of these bacteria. Bioinformatics analysis revealed the presence of various genetic elements. Important toxin-related genes in staphylococci that contribute to their pathogenic potential were identified and confirmed using phenotypic assays, while adherence-related genes, which are essential for attachment to host tissues, surfaces in the dairy environment, and the creation of biofilms, were also present. Interestingly, the Staphylococcus aureus isolates belonged to sequence type 5, which largely consists of methicillin-susceptible isolates that have been involved in severe nosocomial infections. Although genes encoding methicillin resistance were not identified, multiple resistance genes (RGs) conferring resistance to aminoglycosides, macrolides, and fluroquinolones were found. In contrast, LAB had few inherently present RGs and no virulence genes, suggesting their likely safe status as food additives in dairy products. LAB were also richer in bacteriocins and carbohydrate-active enzymes, indicating their potential to suppress pathogens and effectively utilize carbohydrate substrates, respectively. Additionally, mobile genetic elements, present in both LAB and staphylococci, may facilitate the acquisition and dissemination of genetic traits, including RGs, virulence genes, and metabolic factors, with implications for food quality and public health. The molecular and phenotypic characterization presented herein contributes to the effort to mitigate risks and infections (e.g., mastitis) and enhance the safety and quality of milk and products thereof.},

 abstract = {Avian pathogenic \textit{Escherichia coli} (APEC) causes colibacillosis, the disease with the highest economic loss for the broiler industry. However, studies focusing on the prevalence and population structure of APEC in the broiler production pyramid are scarce. Here, we used genotyping and serotyping data to elucidate the APEC population structure and its changes in different broiler production stages along with whole-genome sequencing (WGS) in a subset of APEC isolates to determine transmission patterns amongst dominant APEC sequence types (STs) and characterize them in detail. Comparison of genotypes encountered in both APEC and avian fecal \textit{E. coli} (AFEC) provided further insights. Overall, APEC-related mortality, as the proportion of the total sampled mortality in the broiler production, was high (35\%), while phylogroup C and serogroup O78 were predominant amongst APEC isolates. We found a low (34.0\%) and high (53.3\%) incidence of colibacillosis in chicks and end-cycle broilers, respectively, which may be related to a shift in APEC genotypes, suggesting a trend from commensalism to pathogenicity across different broiler production stages. Despite considerable APEC genotypic diversity, there was substantial genotype overlap (40.9\%, overall) over the production stages and convergence of STs to the four clusters. Within these clusters, WGS data provided evidence of clonal transmission events and revealed an enriched virulence and resistance APEC repertoire. More specifically, sequenced APEC were assigned to defined pathotypes based on their virulence gene content while the majority (86\%) was genotypically multi-drug resistant. Interestingly, WGS-based phylogeny showed that a subset of APEC, which are cephalosporin-resistant, may originate directly from cephalosporin-resistant AFEC. Finally, exploration of the APEC plasmidome indicated that the small fraction of the APEC virulome carried by IncF plasmids is pivotal for the manifestation of the APEC pathotype; thus, plasmid exchange can promote pathogenicity in strains that are at the edge of the commensal and pathogenic states.},

The fly species Drosophila biauraria carries a maternally transmitted MK-inducing partiti-like virus, but it was unknown if it carries other MK-inducing endosymbionts. Here, we identified two male-killing Wolbachia strains (wBiau1 and wBiau2) from D. biauraria and compared their genomes to elucidate their evolutionary processes. The two strains were genetically closely related but had exceptionally different genome structures with considerable rearrangements compared with combinations of other Wolbachia strains. Despite substantial changes in the genome structure, the two Wolbachia strains did not experience gene losses that would disrupt the male-killing expression or persistence in the host population. The two Wolbachia-infected matrilines carried distinct mitochondrial haplotypes, suggesting that wBiau1 and wBiau2 have invaded D. biauraria independently and undergone considerable genome changes owing to unknown selective pressures in evolutionary history. This study demonstrated the presence of three male-killers from two distinct origins in one fly species and highlighted the diverse and rapid genome evolution of MK Wolbachia in the host.},

In that period, few ertapenem-resistant but meropenem-susceptible Klebsiella pneumoniae isolates belonging to sequence type (ST) 37 were retrieved from clinical samples. These strains produced the CTX-M-15 extended spectrum β-lactamase, OmpK35 was depleted due to a nonsense mutation, and a novel OmpK36 variant was identified. Yet, starting from 2010, Klebsiella pneumoniae carbapenemase (KPC)-producing ST512 isolates started prevailing and ST37 vanished from sight. Since 2018 the clinical use of the combination of ceftazidime–avibactam (CZA) has been introduced in clinical practice for the treatment of bacteria producing serine-β-lactamases, but KPC-producing, CZA-resistant K. pneumoniae are emerging. In 2021, four CZA-resistant ST37 isolates producing KPC variants were isolated from the same number of patients. blaKPC gene cloning in Escherichia coli was used to define the role of those KPC variants on CZA resistance, and whole genome sequencing was performed on these isolates and on three ST37 historical isolates from 2011. CZA resistance was due to mutations in the blaKPC genes carried on related pKpQIL-type plasmids, and three variants of the KPC enzyme have been identified in the four ST37 strains. The four ST37 isolates were closely related to each other and to the historical isolates, suggesting that ST37 survived without notice in our hospital for 10 years, waiting to re-emerge as a CZA-resistant K. pneumoniae clone. The ancestor of these contemporary isolates derives from ST37 wild-type porin strains, with no other mutations in chromosomal genes involved in conferring antibiotic resistance (parC, gyrA, ramR, mgrB, pmrB).},

 abstract = {The myriad of available hepatocyte in vitro models provides researchers the possibility to select hepatocyte-like cells (HLCs) for specific research goals. However, direct comparison of hepatocyte models is currently challenging. We systematically searched the literature and compared different HLCs, but reported functions were limited to a small subset of hepatic functions. To enable a more comprehensive comparison, we developed an algorithm to compare transcriptomic data across studies that tested HLCs derived from hepatocytes, biliary cells, fibroblasts, and pluripotent stem cells, alongside primary human hepatocytes (PHHs). This revealed that no HLC covered the complete hepatic transcriptome, highlighting the importance of HLC selection. HLCs derived from hepatocytes had the highest transcriptional resemblance to PHHs regardless of the protocol, whereas the quality of fibroblasts and PSC derived HLCs varied depending on the protocol used. Finally, we developed and validated a web application (HLCompR) enabling comparison for specific pathways and addition of new HLCs. In conclusion, our comprehensive transcriptomic comparison of HLCs allows selection of HLCs for specific research questions and can guide improvements in culturing conditions.},

 abstract = {Accurate liver disease modeling and drug toxicity testing still remain challenging as liver cells in vitro poorly resemble adult hepatocytes, as we previously demonstrated using whole transcriptome and cell identity analysis. To address this, we used our insights into hepatic modeling to develop hepatocyte-like liver organoids (HeLLOs), a novel human organoid model with mature hepatocyte functions superior to existing models. HeLLOs are easily established from (small) healthy or diseased liver tissues and rapidly expanded for an extended period in optimized culture conditions. Transcriptomic and functional analyses revealed that differentiated HeLLOs closely resemble fresh primary human hepatocytes (PHHs) and perform key hepatic functions such as gluconeogenesis, drug metabolism, and bile acid synthesis. We developed a HeLLO-based toxicity assay with higher sensitivity in predicting liver toxicity of known liver-toxic drugs compared to the gold-standard PHHs. By modeling disease-related mechanisms, such as bile acid transport, HeLLOs uncover transport-inhibition toxicity mechanisms of known liver toxic drugs. Single cell sequencing analysis of HeLLOs identified a heterogeneous cluster of cells with cholangiocyte-like and hepatocyte-like cells, overall resembling liver regenerative cells. As such, HeLLOs hold great promise for advancing liver disease modeling and drug testing. To our knowledge, HeLLOs are the best expandable liver model for predicting adverse drug reactions as well as modeling various liver disease mechanisms.},

 abstract = {American lobsters (Homarus americanus) stored in open tidal pounds can develop impoundment shell disease (ISD), resulting in decreased marketability of the lobsters on the live market. Little is known about ISD or the immunological responses of lobsters exhibiting this disease. The objective of this project was to identify genes from H. americanus hepatopancreas that are differentially expressed in response to ISD. Lobsters were separated into asymptomatic, moderately symptomatic, and severely symptomatic groups, which represent animals with 0\%, 5\%–20\%, and {\textgreater}20\% lesion coverage of the carapace, respectively. RNA-seq analysis found that 134 genes were differentially expressed between groups (false discovery rate (FDR) {\textless} 0.05). Most, 80, of these genes were found exclusively in the comparison between moderately symptomatic and asymptomatic groups. All animals clustered in their proposed groups based on the expression of the differently expressed genes (DEGs), and the asymptomatic group clustered as an out-group. The expression of most DEGs was higher in the asymptomatic group than the others, which could be related to a stronger response against the disease or differences in individual resistance against ISD development. Among these genes, we highlight eight chitin-related genes, one α-2-macroglobulin-like gene, one acute phase serum amyloid A gene, one pseudohaemocyanin gene, and one trypsin-1-like gene.},

 abstract = {The spike protein (SP) of SARS-CoV-2 (SC-2) is susceptible to high mutation and has contributed to the multiple waves of COVID-19 being experienced. Hence, targeting the SP remains a logical approach in the development of potent therapeutics against SARS-CoV-2. Here, a computational technique was adopted to identify broad-spectrum plant secondary metabolites with indigenous relevance in the management of respiratory infections against the SPs of the SC-2 wild- type (SC-2WT) and omicron variants. Following 100 ns molecular dynamic (MD) simulation and binding free energy calculation of the top five compounds identified through molecular docking, maysin (SC-2WT (-34.85 kcal/mol), omicron (-38.88 kcal/mol)) and geraniin (SC-2WT (-36.90 kcal/mol) omicron (-31.28 kcal/mol)) had better broad-spectrum activities for the investigated SPs than zafirlukast (SC-2WT (-33.73 kcal/mol) omicron (-22.38 kcal/mol)). Furthermore, 6-hydroxycyanidin-3-rutinoside (-42.97 kcal/mol) and kaempferol-7-glucoside (-37.11 kcal/mol) had the best affinity for the SPs of omicron and SC-2WT, respectively. Interestingly, except for Kaempferol-7-glucoside against omicron SP, all the top-ranked compounds were thermodynamically stable with the SP of both variants, and this observation was linked to the number, nature, and bond length in the resulting complexes in each case. Also, except for geraniin, all the top-ranked compounds had lower toxicity profiles compared to zafirlukast and this could be attributed to their phenolic moieties. Nevertheless, the in vitro and in vivo confirmation of the activities observed in this study is recommended, especially for maysin and geraniin with the best broad-spectrum activity, towards development of COVID-19 drug candidates.},

 abstract = {The acquisition of penicillin-binding protein (PBP) 2a in resistant strains of \textit{Staphylococcus aureus} allows for the continuous production of cell walls even after the inactivation of intrinsic PBPs. Thus, the discovery of novel therapeutics with enhanced modulatory activity on PBP2a is crucial, and plant secondary metabolites, such as phenolics, have found relevance in this regard. In this study, using computational techniques, phenolics were screened against the active site of PBP2a, and the ability of the lead phenolics to modulate PBP2a's active and allosteric sites was studied. The top-five phenolics (leads) identified through structure-activity-based screening, pharmacokinetics and synthetic feasibility evaluations were subjected to molecular dynamics simulations. Except for propan-2-one at the active site, the leads had a higher binding free energy at both the active and allosteric sites of PBP2a than amoxicillin. The leads, while promoting the thermodynamic stability of PBP2a, showed a more promising affinity at the allosteric site than the active site, with silicristin (-25.61 kcal/mol) and epicatechin gallate (-47.65 kcal/mol) having the best affinity at the active and allosteric sites, respectively. Interestingly, the modulation of Tyr446, the active site gatekeeper residue in PBP2a, was noted to correlate with the affinity of the leads at the allosteric site. Overall, these observations point to the leads' ability to inhibit PBP2a, either directly or through allosteric modulation with conventional drugs. Further confirmatory in vitro studies on the leads are underway.},

The results demonstrated various inhibitory capacities of the lead phenolics, with lysidicichin (−41.66 kcal/mol) and silicristin (−31.11 kcal/mol) being the most potent against PBP3, while epicatechin 3-O-(3-O-methylgallate) (−38.97 kcal/mol) and epigallocatechin-4-benzyl thioether (−37.01 kcal/mol) had higher affinities towards PBP5. Overall, epicatechin gallate had the best broad-spectrum of activity, as the compound was able to bind favourably to both targets. Additionally, the thermodynamic information confirmed the stability of the lead phenolics with both targets. Conclusively, while these observations are suggestive of the modulatory role of the lead phenolics on the growth of E. coli, further in vitro and in vivo validation of the activity elicited by the phenolics in this study is imperative, and efforts are underway in this direction.},

Thus, the development of new modulators with enhanced binding of PBP2x is highly encouraged. In this study, phenolics, due to their reported antibacterial activities, were screened against the active site of PBP2x using structure-based pharmacophore and molecular docking techniques, and the ability of the top-hit phenolics to inhibit the active and allosteric sites of PBP2x was refined through 120 ns molecular dynamic simulation. Except for gallocatechin gallate and lysidicichin, respectively, at the active and allosteric sites of PBP2x, the top-hit phenolics had higher negative binding free energy (ΔGbind) than amoxicillin [active site (− 19.23 kcal/mol), allosteric site (− 33.75 kcal/mol)]. Although silicristin had the best broad-spectrum effects at the active (− 38.41 kcal/mol) and allosteric (− 50.54 kcal/mol) sites of PBP2x, the high thermodynamic entropy (4.90 Å) of the resulting complex might suggest the need for its possible structural refinement for enhanced potency. Interestingly, silicristin had a predicted synthetic feasibility score of {\textless} 5 and quantum calculations using the DFT B3LYP/6-31G+ (dp) revealed that silicristin is less stable and more reactive than amoxicillin. These findings point to the possible benefits of the top-hit phenolics, and most especially silicristin, in the direct and synergistic treatment of infections caused by S. pneumoniae. Accordingly, silicristin is currently the subject of further confirmatory in vitro research.},

 abstract = {Frontotemporal dementia (FTD) is a neurodegenerative disorder characterised by impaired behaviour and language. It affects individuals between 45 and 65 years of age. The present study aims to identify potential phytochemicals against target receptor of FTD. Transcriptome data analysis guided computer-aided drug design (CADD) was conducted to investigate molecular interactions between active phytochemicals present in Indian spices and differentially expressed genes. In present study, samples for patients with FTD were obtained from GEO dataset [GSE92340]. The samples were pre-processed followed by differential gene expression analysis using DESeq2. The patient sample was analyzed for 1882 upregulated genes. Hub gene out of DEGs was identified using CytoHubba Plugin of Cytoscape based on eleven parameters (Degree, Edge Percolated Component (EPC), Maximum Neighbourhood Component (MNC), Density of Maximum Neighbourhood Component (DMNC), Maximal Clique Centrality (MCC), Bottleneck, EcCentricity, Closeness, Radiality, Betweenness, and Stress). HDAC1 gene was identified as hub gene and key target in case of FTD. CADD pipeline was used to identify phytochemicals against HDAC1 gene. A list of eighty-one phytochemicals found in Indian spices was analyzed for their drug likeness abilities using molinspiration and toxicity prediction using ProTox-II, which identified twenty-three phytochemicals as safe drug-like compounds. PatchDock was employed to examine interactions between phytochemical compounds and HDAC1. Molecular interactions revealed rosmarinic acid derived from rosemary (Salvia rosmarinus) as the most effective drug for FTD having lowest ACE value of −395 kcal/mol. In conclusion, this study demonstrates essential role of HDAC1 in pathogenesis of FTD and demonstrates the neuroprotective potential of rosmarinic acid against FTD.},

 abstract = {Chitin is the second most abundant polysaccharide worldwide as part of arthropods' exoskeletons and fungal cell walls. Low concentrations in soils and sediments indicate rapid decomposition through chitinolytic organisms in terrestrial and aquatic ecosystems. The enacting enzymes, so‐called chitinases, and their products, chitooligosaccharides, exhibit promising characteristics with applications ranging from crop protection to cosmetics, medical, textile, and wastewater industries. Exploring novel chitinolytic organisms is crucial to expand the enzymatical toolkit for biotechnological chitin utilization and to deepen our understanding of diverse catalytic mechanisms. In this study, we present two long‐read sequencing‐based genomes of highly similar Jeongeupia species, which have been screened, isolated, and biochemically characterized from chitin‐amended soil samples. Through metabolic characterization, whole‐genome alignments, and phylogenetic analysis, we could demonstrate how the investigated strains differ from the taxonomically closest strain Jeongeupia naejangsanensis BIO‐TAS4‐2T (DSM 24253). In silico analysis and sequence alignment revealed a multitude of highly conserved chitinolytic enzymes in the investigated Jeongeupia genomes. Based on these results, we suggest that the two strains represent a novel species within the genus of Jeongeupia, which may be useful for environmentally friendly N‐acetylglucosamine production from crustacean shell or fungal biomass waste or as a crop protection agent., In this study, a novel chitinolytic Jeongeupia species “wiesaeckerbachi” was isolated from soil samples, characterized biochemically, and sequenced with the long‐read platform PacBio Sequel IIe. In silico analysis unraveled genomic differences to the closest related type strain Jeongeupia naejangsanensis TAS4‐2 in addition to an usually extensive chitinolytic machinery.},

Chloroplast (Cp) genomes play a vital role in comprehending plant evolution, biodiversity, and phylogenetics. Snake fruit is a tropical fruit in the Indo-Malayan region. This work compares seven Salacca species Cp genomes to clarify their genetics and evolutionary connections. Cp genomes were constructed using sequencing data from the BGISeq-500 platform and the GetOrganelle assemblers. The assembled Cp genomes have a standard four-part structure and vary in length from 157,047 to 158,182 kilobase pairs (kbp). Comparative genomics analysis found the ycf1 gene to have the highest number of single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs), revealing missing amino acids in Salacca affinis. The Cp genomes showed a high prevalence of mononucleotide SSR motifs. With a few exceptions, especially Salacca wallichiana, most Cp genomes showed stable borders between the large single copy (LSC), inverted repeat (IR), and short single copy (SSC) sections. This research underscores the importance of Cp genome information for identifying species, a crucial tool for evolutionary studies and breeding purposes. Furthermore, it emphasizes the intimate genetic connection between Salacca and Cocos nucifera, which contrasts with Phoenix dactylifera. This thorough research provides vital insights into the genetics of Salacca species and highlights the usefulness of Cp genome data in subsequent analyses.},

AgrA modulating metabolites constitute a new approach to reducing resistance development. This study created a library of 1211 metabolites from 266 South African plants with antimicrobial action. Metabolites’ anti-QS activities were assessed using advanced computational methods. Molecular docking showed 5 top metabolites (hinokiflavone, asphodelin, elliptinone, mamegakinone, robustaflavone). Most leads conformed to the Lipinski’s rule of 5. Dynamics simulation revealed closest ∆Gbind for robustaflavone (-25.50 kcal/mol), and hinokiflavone (-20.94 kcal/mol) compared to the standard (-26.59 kcal/mol). Leads interacted with key residues (Asn62/201, Asp75/214, Arg94/233, Asn95/234) and high number of interactions that ensured thermodynamic stability and compactness. The identified leads could be key mechanistic contributors to the antimicrobial activity of their inherent plants. Both the plants and metabolites (robustaflavone, hinokiflavone) could be further explored following structural modification as QS inhibitors.},

 abstract = {Rhynchosporium commune is a fungal pathogen responsible for causing scald disease in barley, leading to significant yield losses and reduced grain quality in susceptible cultivars. Effector proteins secreted by R. commune play crucial roles in manipulating host defenses and facilitating infection. Hence, this study aimed to identify and characterize effector candidates (ECs) in R. commune using a comprehensive bioinformatics approach combined with experimental validation. Initially, a dataset of 12,211 genes from the R. commune strain UK7 genome was analyzed to identify potential ECs, resulting in the selection of 48 candidate proteins. These candidates were further validated using RNA-Seq analysis, which confirmed significant expression of 27 ECs during infection. Our analysis re-identified key effectors, including CZT06923 and CZT13833, with 100\% identity to NIP3 and NIP2, respectively, in R. commune. Novel ECs, such as CZT07600, CZT13755, and CZT13375, were identified with lower identity to NIP2, suggesting potential variants. Additionally, structural analysis revealed that CZT07873 EC indicates significant structural similarity to known fungal effector. qRT-PCR validation confirmed the differential expression of CZS93219 and CZT13755, with peak expression at 9 and 12 dpi, respectively. This comprehensive approach enhances our understanding of R. commune’s pathogenic mechanisms and provides insights into potential targets for developing disease management strategies in barley cultivation.},

 abstract = {Root nodules of legume plants are primarily inhabited by rhizobial nitrogen-fixing bacteria. Here, we propose two new \textit{Rhizobiales} species isolated from root nodules of common sainfoin (Onobrychis viciifolia), as shown by core-gene phylogeny, overall genome relatedness indices, and pan-genome analysis. Mesorhizobium onobrychidis sp. nov. actively induces nodules and achieves atmospheric nitrogen and carbon dioxide fixation. This species appears to be depleted in motility genes and is enriched in genes for direct effects on plant growth performance. Its genome reveals functional and plant growth-promoting signatures, like a large unique chromosomal genomic island with high density of symbiotic genetic traits. Onobrychidicola muellerharveyae gen. nov. sp. nov. is described as a type species of the new genus \textit{Onobrychidicola} in \textit{Rhizobiaceae}. This species comprises unique genetic features and plant growth-promoting traits (PGPTs), which strongly indicate its function in biotic stress reduction and motility. We applied a newly developed bioinformatics approach for \textit{in silico} prediction of PGPTs (PGPT-Pred), which supports the different lifestyles of the two new species and the plant growth-promoting performance of M. onobrychidis in the greenhouse trial. \textbf{IMPORTANCE} The intensive use of chemical fertilizers has a variety of negative effects on the environment. Increased utilization of biological nitrogen fixation (BNF) is one way to mitigate those negative impacts. In order to optimize BNF, suitable candidates for different legume species are required. Despite intensive search for new rhizobial bacteria associated with legumes, no new rhizobia have recently been identified from sainfoin (Onobrychis viciifolia). Here, we report on the discovery of two new rhizobial species associated with sainfoin, which are of high importance for the host and may help to increase sustainability in agricultural practices. We employed the combination of \textit{in silico} prediction and \textit{in planta} experiments, which is an effective way to detect promising plant growth-promoting bacteria.},

 abstract = {Fowlpox (FP) is an economically important viral disease of commercial poultry. The fowlpox virus (FPV) is primarily characterised by immunoblotting, restriction enzyme analysis in combination with PCR, and/or nucleotide sequencing of amplicons. Whole-genome sequencing (WGS) of FPV directly from clinical specimens prevents the risk of potential genome modifications associated with in vitro culturing of the virus. Only one study has sequenced FPV genomes directly from clinical samples using Nanopore sequencing, however, the study didn't compare the sequences against Illumina sequencing or laboratory propagated sequences. Here, the suitability of WGS for strain identification of FPV directly from cutaneous tissue was evaluated, using a combination of Illumina and Nanopore sequencing technologies. Sequencing results were compared with the sequence obtained from FPV grown in chorioallantoic membranes (CAMs) of chicken embryos. Complete genome sequence of FPV was obtained directly from affected comb tissue using a map to reference approach. FPV sequence from cutaneous tissue was highly similar to that of the virus grown in CAMs with a nucleotide identity of 99.8\%. Detailed polymorphism analysis revealed the presence of a highly comparable number of single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in the two sequences when compared to the reference genome, providing essentially the same strain identification information. Comparative genome analysis of the map to reference consensus sequences from the two genomes revealed that this field isolate had the highest nucleotide identity of 99.5\% with an FPV strain from the USA (Fowlpox virus isolate, FWPV-MN00.2, MH709124) and 98.8\% identity with the Australian FPV vaccine strain (FWPV-S, MW142017). Sequencing results showed that WGS directly from cutaneous tissues is not only rapid and cost-effective but also provides essentially the same strain identification information as in-vitro grown virus, thus circumventing in vitro culturing.},

 abstract = {SARS-CoV-2 is the RNA virus responsible for COVID-19, the prognosis of which has been found to be slightly worse in men. The present study aimed to analyze the expression of different mRNAs and their regulatory molecules (miRNAs and lncRNAs) to consider the potential existence of sex-specific expression patterns and COVID-19 susceptibility using bioinformatics analysis. The binding sites of all human mature miRNA sequences on the SARS-CoV-2 genome nucleotide sequence were predicted by the miRanda tool. Sequencing data was excavated using the Galaxy web server from GSE157103, and the output of feature counts was analyzed using DEseq2 packages to obtain differentially expressed genes (DEGs). Gene set enrichment analysis (GSEA) and DEG annotation analyses were performed using the ToppGene and Metascape tools. Using the RNA Interactome Database, we predicted interactions between differentially expressed lncRNAs and differentially expressed mRNAs. Finally, their networks were constructed with top miRNAs. We identified 11 miRNAs with three to five binding sites on the SARS-COVID-2 genome reference. MiR-29c-3p, miR-21-3p, and miR-6838-5p occupied four binding sites, and miR-29a-3p had five binding sites on the SARS-CoV-2 genome. Moreover, miR-29a-3p, and miR-29c-3p were the top miRNAs targeting DEGs. The expression levels of miRNAs (125, 181b, 130a, 29a, b, c, 212, 181a, 133a) changed in males with COVID-19, in whom they regulated ACE2 expression and affected the immune response by affecting phagosomes, complement activation, and cell-matrix adhesion. Our results indicated that XIST lncRNA was up-regulated, and TTTY14, TTTY10, and ZFY-AS1 lncRN as were down-regulated in both ICU and non-ICU men with COVID-19. Dysregulation of noncoding-RNAs has critical effects on the pathophysiology of men with COVID-19, which is why they may be used as biomarkers and therapeutic agents. Overall, our results indicated that the miR-29 family target regulation patterns and might become promising biomarkers for severity and survival outcome in men with COVID-19.},

@article{atac_identification_2024,
 abstract = {The proneural transcription factor atonal basic helix–loop–helix transcription factor 7 (ATOH7) is expressed in early progenitors in the developing neuroretina. In vertebrates, this is crucial for the development of retinal ganglion cells (RGCs), as mutant animals show an almost complete absence of RGCs, underdeveloped optic nerves, and aberrations in retinal vessel development. Human mutations are rare and result in autosomal recessive optic nerve hypoplasia (ONH) or severe vascular changes, diagnosed as autosomal recessive persistent hyperplasia of the primary vitreous (PHPVAR). To better understand the role of ATOH7 in neuroretinal development, we created ATOH7 knockout and eGFP-expressing ATOH7 reporter human induced pluripotent stem cells (hiPSCs), which were differentiated into early-stage retinal organoids. Target loci regulated by ATOH7 were identified by Cleavage Under Targets and Release Using Nuclease with sequencing (CUT\&RUN-seq) and differential expression by RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) of wildtype and mutant organoid-derived reporter cells. Additionally, single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) was performed on whole organoids to identify cell type-specific genes. Mutant organoids displayed substantial deficiency in axon sprouting, reduction in RGCs, and an increase in other cell types. We identified 469 differentially expressed target genes, with an overrepresentation of genes belonging to axon development/guidance and Notch signaling. Taken together, we consolidate the function of human ATOH7 in guiding progenitor competence by inducing RGC-specific genes while inhibiting other cell fates. Furthermore, we highlight candidate genes responsible for ATOH7-associated optic nerve and retinovascular anomalies, which sheds light to potential future therapy targets for related disorders.},

Its high throughput and decreasing cost have led to significant changes in outbreak investigations and surveillance of a wide variety of microbial pathogens. Despite the innumerable advantages of WGS, several drawbacks concerning data analysis and management, as well as a general lack of standardisation, hinder its integration in routine use. In this work, a bioinformatics workflow for (Illumina) WGS data is presented for bacterial characterisation including genome annotation, species identification, serotype prediction, antimicrobial resistance prediction, virulence-related genes and plasmid replicon detection, core-genome-based or single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP)-based phylogenetic clustering and sequence typing. Workflow was tested using a collection of 22 in-house sequences of Salmonella enterica isolates belonging to a local outbreak, coupled with a collection of 182 Salmonella genomes publicly available. No errors were reported during the execution period, and all genomes were analysed. The bioinformatics workflow can be tailored to other pathogens of interest and is freely available for academic and non-profit use as an uploadable file to the Galaxy platform.},

@article{avery_putative_2025,
 abstract = {Sortase enzymes are cysteine transpeptidases at the cell surface of Gram-positive bacteria. Localized to distinct foci on the cell membrane, class A sortases (SrtAs) recognize a cell wall sorting signal (CWSS), and, following cleavage at this specific binding motif, target proteins are ligated to precursors of the growing peptidoglycan layer. This activity of SrtA enzymes is utilized extensively in sortase-mediated ligation (SML) strategies for a variety of protein engineering applications. Typically, engineered variants of SrtA are used for SML experiments, considering the relatively low catalytic efficiency of this enzyme. Understandably, most biochemical studies are conducted with the isolated catalytic domain of SrtA enzymes from various bacteria, and the stereochemistry of the endogenous interaction between SrtA and its substrate is not well understood. Here, we used AlphaFold2 to create a model of the full-length SrtA enzyme from Streptococcus pyogenes (spySrtA) with or without either a peptide substrate or a portion of M protein, a cellular target. We ran triplicate 500 ns molecular dynamics simulations for each model embedded in a lipid bilayer, which revealed several stereochemical features of this system. Contact map analyses revealed specific interactions between catalytic domain positions of spySrtA and the lipid bilayer, as well as between the enzyme and M protein residues outside the canonical LPXTG pentapeptide CWSS. We also characterized a putative transmembrane domain interaction between spySrtA and M protein that we predict orients and stabilizes substrate binding. If present in vivo, we predict that these interactions may increase the catalytic efficiency of the enzyme for its substrates and could provide important stereochemical insights for SML uses.},

Animal contact is a major risk factor for C. parvum outbreaks which require thorough investigation through the use of molecular subtyping. Recently, a multi-locus variable-number tandem repeat analysis (MLVA) scheme was established for C. parvum, offering improved subtyping resolution compared to the commonly used single-locus 60 kDa glycoprotein gene (gp60) subtyping approach. Using the C. parvum MLVA scheme, the genetic diversity of known gp60 subtyped faecal DNA extracts collected between April 1st 2023 and March 31st 2024 was explored. A representative group of a common Scottish gp60 subtype (IIaA15G2R1, n = 28) was analysed by MLVA and found to consist of 8 distinct complete MLVA profiles, with 4-12-5-7-27-36-16 (n = 12) being the most common. Genetic diversity within samples involved in three historic animal contact outbreaks (Outbreaks A, B and C) was investigated. Outbreak A, involving a single gp60 subtype (IIaA19G1R1), consisted of only one MLVA profile (4-12-5-8-27-15-17). Outbreak B was caused by two gp60 subtypes (IIaA17G1R1 and IIaA15G2R1), which were further subdivided into four MLVA profiles, two per gp60 subtype (4-14-4-7-27-37-15 and 4-14-5-7-27-27-15, and 4-13-4-8-27-31-17 and 4-12-5-7-27-42-16, respectively). Lastly, Outbreak C, thought to have two-point sources of infection, involved one gp60 subtype (IIaA15G2R1), which was subdivided into four distinct MLVA profiles (4-12-5-7-27-36-16, 4-12-5-7-27-32-15, 4-12-5-7-27-30-15, and 4-14-5-7-36-33-15). Improved MLVA resolution allowed outbreak specimens with insufficient epidemiological data to be linked to a source through sharing a common MLVA profile.},

Using PCR amplification and Sanger sequencing of only a single marker, \textit{csp1} typing is readily available to most laboratories and highly reproducible. Here, I evaluate the usefulness of the \textit{csp1} marker for resistance detection and epidemiologic stratification among A. fumigatus isolates. After resolving nomenclature conflicts from published studies and adding novel \textit{csp1} types, the number of known types now adds up to 38. Their distribution mostly correlates with A. fumigatus population structure, and they are also meaningful for narrowly defined cases of azole resistance phenotypes. Isolates carrying the pandemic resistance allele TR$_{\textrm{34}}$/L98H show signs of interclade crossing of strains with t02 or t04A, into the t11 clade. Furthermore, absolute differences in voriconazole MIC values between t02/t04B versus t11 TR$_{\textrm{34}}$/L98H isolates indicate that the genetic background of resistance mutations may have a pivotal role in cross-resistance phenotypes and, thus, clinical outcome and environmental selection. Despite the general genetic similarity of isolates with identical \textit{csp1} types, outcrossing into other clades is also observed. The \textit{csp1} type alone, therefore, does not sufficiently discriminate genetic clades to be used as the sole marker in epidemiologic studies. \textbf{IMPORTANCE} Aspergillus fumigatus is a ubiquitously distributed saprophytic mold and a leading cause of invasive aspergillosis in human hosts. Pandemic azole-resistant strains have emerged on a global scale, which are thought to be propagated through use of azole-based fungicides in agriculture.

Hence, the present study aimed to establish a way of identifying flavonoids with anti-HBV activities. Flavonoid structures with anti-HBV activities were retrieved. A flavonol-based pharmacophore model was established using LigandScout v4.4. Screening was performed using the PharmIt server. A QSAR equation was developed and validated with independent sets of compounds. The applicability domain (AD) was defined using Euclidean distance calculations for model validation. The best model, consisting of 57 features, was generated. High-throughput screening (HTS) using the flavonol-based model resulted in 509 unique hits. The model’s accuracy was further validated using a set of FDA-approved chemicals, demonstrating a sensitivity of 71\% and a specificity of 100\%. Additionally, the QSAR model with two predictors, x4a and qed, exhibited predictive solid performance with an adjusted-R2 value of 0.85 and 0.90 of Q2. PCA showed essential patterns and relationships within the dataset, with the first two components explaining nearly 98\% of the total variance. Current HBV therapies tend to fail to provide a complete cure, emphasizing the need for new therapies. This study’s importance was to highlight flavonols as potential anti-HBV medicines, presenting a supplementary option for existing therapy. The QSAR model has been validated with two separate chemical sets, guaranteeing its reproducibility and usefulness for other flavonols by utilizing the predictive characteristics of X4A and qed. These results provide new possibilities for discovering future anti-HBV drugs by integrating modeling and experimental research.},

 abstract = {The mammalian suprachiasmatic nucleus (SCN), located in the ventral hypothalamus, synchronizes and maintains daily cellular and physiological rhythms across the body, in accordance with environmental and visceral cues. Consequently, the systematic regulation of spatiotemporal gene transcription in the SCN is vital for daily timekeeping. So far, the regulatory elements assisting circadian gene transcription have only been studied in peripheral tissues, lacking the critical neuronal dimension intrinsic to the role of the SCN as central brain pacemaker. By using histone-ChIP-seq, we identified SCN-enriched gene regulatory elements that associated with temporal gene expression. Based on tissue-specific H3K27ac and H3K4me3 marks, we successfully produced the first-ever SCN gene-regulatory map. We found that a large majority of SCN enhancers not only show robust 24-h rhythmic modulation in H3K27ac occupancy, peaking at distinct times of day, but also possess canonical E-box (CACGTG) motifs potentially influencing downstream cycling gene expression. To establish enhancer–gene relationships in the SCN, we conducted directional RNA-seq at six distinct times across the day and night, and studied the association between dynamically changing histone acetylation and gene transcript levels. About 35\% of the cycling H3K27ac sites were found adjacent to rhythmic gene transcripts, often preceding the rise in mRNA levels. We also noted that enhancers encompass noncoding, actively transcribing enhancer RNAs (eRNAs) in the SCN, which in turn oscillate, along with cyclic histone acetylation, and correlate with rhythmic gene transcription. Taken together, these findings shed light on genome-wide pretranscriptional regulation operative in the central clock that confers its precise and robust oscillation necessary to orchestrate daily timekeeping in mammals.},

The current investigation emphasizes on in-silico identification and comparative analysis of different fungal lactases present in Aspergillus fumigatus, Aspergillus oryzae, Botrytis cinerea, and Fusarium fujikuroi. Prediction of motifs and domains, chromosomal positioning, gene structure, gene ontology, sub-cellular localization and protein modeling were performed using different bioinformatics tools to have an insight into the structural and functional characteristics of β-galactosidases. Evolutionary and homology relationships were established by phylogenetic and synteny analyses. A total of 14 β-gal genes (GH-35) were identified in these species. Identified lactases, having 5 domains, were predicted to be stable, acidic, non-polar and extracellularly localized with roles in polysaccharide catabolic process. Results showed variable exonic/intronic ratios of the gene structures which were randomly positioned on chromosomes. Moreover, synteny blocks and close evolutionary relationships were observed between Aspergillus fumigatus and Aspergillus oryzae. Structural insights allowed the prediction of best protein models based on the higher ERRAT and Q-MEAN values. And RNA-sequencing analysis, performed on A. fumigatus, elucidated the role of β-gal in germ tube development. This study would pave the way for efficient fungal lactase production as it identified β-gal genes and predicted their various features and also it would provide a road-way to further the understanding of A. fumigatus pathogenicity via the expression insights of β-gal in germ tube development.},

These characteristics, together with the systematic position of ferns among vascular plants, make it of high interest for evolutionary, conservation and functional genomics studies. The transcriptome was constructed de novo and contained 36,430 transcripts, of which 17,706 had valid BLAST hits. A total of 19,539 transcripts showed at least one of the 7362 GO terms assigned to the transcriptome, whereas 6547 transcripts showed at least one of the 1359 KEGG assigned terms. A prospective analysis of functional annotation results provided relevant insights on genes involved in important functions such as growth and development as well as physiological adaptations. In this context, a catalogue of genes involved in the genetic control of plant development, during the vegetative to reproductive transition, in stress response as well as genes coding for transcription factors is given. Altogether, this study provides a first step towards understanding the gene expression of a significant fern species and the in silico functional and comparative analyses reported here provide important data and insights for further comparative evolutionary studies in ferns and land plants in general.},

 abstract = {In plants, exposure to high light irradiation induces various stress responses, which entail complex metabolic rearrangements. To explore these dynamics, we conducted time-course experiments spanning 2 min to 72 h with Arabidopsis thaliana under high and control light. Comparative metabolomics, transcriptomics, redox proteomics, and stable isotope labeling on leaf rosettes identified a series of synchronous and successive responses that provide a deeper insight into well-orchestrated mechanisms contributing to high-light acclimation. We observed transient transcriptome downregulation related to light harvesting and electron flow before the profound remodeling of the photosynthetic apparatus. Throughout the entire time course, redox homeostasis is tightly balanced between downregulation of production and enhanced transformation of NADPH accompanied by redistribution of reducing equivalents across several subcellular compartments. In both light conditions, C4 acids such as malate and fumarate are produced via anaplerosis. In carbon units, their accumulation in vacuoles surpasses plastidic levels of starch and intensifies notably under high light. In parallel, citrate synthesis from pyruvate is significantly hindered diurnally. Isotopic labeling in 2-oxoglutarate and glutamate suggests a moderate de novo synthesis of C5 acids from a vacuolar citrate reservoir during the light phase while they are largely renewed during the night. In the absence of a diurnal clockwise flow through the tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle, increased oxidation of photorespiratory glycine takes over as a source of reductants to fuel mitochondrial ATP production. These findings, along with previous research, contribute to a model integrating redox balance and linking increased carbon assimilation and nitrogen metabolism, especially in the context of an incomplete TCA cycle.},

@phdthesis{baldwin_evaluating_2019,
 abstract = {Chlorpyrifos (CPF) is an organophosphate pesticide used extensively in Canada and around the world. Due to its highly conserved mechanism of action involving inhibition of acetylcholinesterase (AChE), CPF has the ability to exert toxicity on non-target species in aquatic systems. In fish species, exposure to CPF has been associated with a range of adverse effects across physiological endpoints including abnormal development, inhibition of AChE, immunomodulation, and molecular level effects such as altered expression of specific genes and global transcriptomes. However, the literature on amphibians exposed to CPF is not as extensive despite the known global declines of amphibian species and the hypothesized links between these declines and anthropogenic pesticide contamination of aquatic systems worldwide. The overall objective of this thesis was to gain a better understanding of the sub-lethal effects of CPF exposure on the model amphibian, Xenopus laevis, across levels of biological organization from molecular to whole animal. 
The first study (Chapter 2) examined the molecular toxicity pathways and mechanisms of toxicity after short-term exposure of early life-stage (ELS) X. laevis to CPF using whole body transcriptome analyses. The ELS transcriptomic responses were then compared to apical outcomes of chronic exposure to CPF to determine if identified dysregulated pathways could provide early indicators of these adverse outcomes. Post-hatch individuals were exposed to nominal CPF concentrations of 0.4, 2, or 10 μg L-1. A subset of individuals were sampled at 96 hours (h) for whole-body transcriptomic analysis and remaining individuals were transferred to tanks for long-term exposure through to metamorphic climax ({\textasciitilde} 75 days). Pathway analysis revealed dysregulated pathways that were related to outcomes known to be associated with exposure to CPF such as altered serine hydrolase activity, impacted metabolic processes, and immune-related outcomes. Other dysregulated pathways with less precedence in the literature included vasculature development and sensory perception of light stimulus. Apical outcomes of chronic CPF exposure included inhibition of AChE activity, increased relative liver weight, and a decrease in percentage of individuals that reached metamorphic climax. Dysregulation of serine hydrolase associated pathways after ELS CPF exposure is in agreeance with the decrease in AChE (a serine hydrolase enzyme) activity observed in the brains of individuals at metamorphic climax. Additionally, an increase in relative liver weight after chronic CPF exposure could be related to dysregulation of ELS pathways associated with metabolic processes and immune function. In fact, several pathways related to immune function were depleted.
In Chapter 3, we more closely examined the potential immunotoxicity of sub-lethal CPF exposure. Post-metamorphic individuals were exposed 1 or 10 μg L-1 CPF (nominal) for 7 days (d), then administered a phosphate buffered sodium (PBS) control injection or a lipopolysaccharide (LPS) injection to stimulate an inflammatory response. At 24 h post-injection, morphometric indices were recorded and tissues were sampled for differential leukocyte counts (flow cytometry), liver pro-inflammatory cytokine expression (qPCR), and kidney histopathology. At 1 µg L−1 CPF, there was a decrease in circulating lymphocytes, an increase in circulating granulocytes, and an increase in the granulocyte:lymphocyte (GL) ratio regardless of immune state. Liver expression of pro-inflammatory cytokines TNF-α and CSF-1 was increased in individuals exposed to 10 µg L−1 CPF, independent of immune state. Exposure to 10 μg L-1 CPF increased kidney epithelial cell height (by 18 \%) and decreased lumen space in the convoluted tubules of the kidney. This study provided evidence that exposure to CPF can lead to changes in key biomarkers of immune status in amphibians in both immune-rested (PBS-injected) and immune-stimulated (LPS-injected) states. Additionally, we found that LPS was an effective mitogen in our study, capable of inducing a robust and measurable stress response in X. laevis. This response included a decrease in circulating lymphocytes, and increase in circulating monocytes, and an increase in the GL ratio. In addition, increased liver expression of pro-inflammatory cytokines TNF-α, IL-1β, and CSF-1 was induced by LPS injection. We conclude that LPS is an appropriate immunostimulatory agent in an immune challenge assay using X. laevis and that exposure to CPF does not appear to impact the response to LPS exposure. 
Overall, our findings show that exposure to environmentally relevant concentrations of CPF has the ability to impact amphibians at multiple levels of biological organization. A number of affected molecular pathways warrant further study in terms of the underlying mechanisms of CPF-mediated toxicity as well as the associated outcomes of CPF exposure in amphibians. This research provides novel data on the effects of CPF exposure to amphibians, which are generally overlooked and under-represented in the literature despite links between pesticide exposure and globally declining amphibian populations.},

However, the molecular mechanisms linking these mutations and their frequent secondary dosage amplification to tumor formation are still not fully understood. While ample evidence supports a crucial role for the MAPK pathway in tumor development, the primary effectors targeted by this pathway remain largely unexplored. Here we identify the transcriptional repressor Capicua (CIC) as a key target inactivated by KRAS/MAPK signaling in lung adenocarcinoma. We show that genetic loss of CIC recapitulates the phenotypic consequences of amplified KRAS signaling. Genetic disruption of CIC suppressed the requirement for Kras allelic imbalances and accelerated the transformation of bronchiolar Club cells. We also demonstrate that restoring CIC repressor activity impaired proliferation of CIC-deficient tumor cells and reverted resistance to MAPK pathway inhibitors. These results highlight the key role of CIC during lung tumor formation and suggest that selective pressure for effective CIC inactivation favors secondary amplification of KRAS/MAPK signaling in tumor cells.},

 abstract = {DNA repair is crucial for genome stability, in particular for plants which are exposed to high levels of damage arising from UV irradiation, soil pollutants and reactive oxygen species. Damage that affects both strands of the DNA duplex is harder to repair due to both the lack of a template strand and the potential for physical separation of fragmented chromosomes. As such, DNA double-strand breaks (DSBs) and interstrand DNA crosslinks (ICL) are particularly cytotoxic forms of damage. Here we report the functions of FANCONI ANAEMIA I (FANCI), an Arabidopsis thaliana homologue of the mammalian ICL repair protein. We show that in plant cells, as in mammals, FANCI forms a nuclear localised complex with FANCD2. Genetic analysis of plants lacking FANCI displays significant hypersensitivity to the DNA crosslinking reagent mitomycin C. Furthermore, mutation of FANCI in combination with mutations in a second ICL repair factor, METHYL METHANESULFONATE AND UV-SENSITIVE PROTEIN 81 (MUS81), results in increased levels of programmed cell death compared to the corresponding single mutants, revealing roles in maintaining plant genome stability. Sequence analysis of mutational repair of CRISPR-Cas9-induced DSBs revealed that FANCI promotes single nucleotide insertions and reduces longer deletions. This pattern of mutations may reflect roles for FA proteins in replication-coupled repair of a subset of DSBs. Taken together, this analysis finds evidence for multiple roles for FANCI in the maintenance of plant genome stability.},

 abstract = {SARS-CoV-2 continues to evolve, resulting in several ‘variants of concern’ with novel properties. The factors driving SARS-CoV-2 fitness and evolution in the human respiratory tract remain poorly defined. Here, we provide evidence that both viral and host factors co-operate to shape SARS-CoV-2 genotypic and phenotypic change. Through viral whole-genome sequencing, we explored the evolution of two clinical isolates of SARS-CoV-2 during passage in unmodified Vero-derived cell lines and in parallel, in well-differentiated primary nasal epithelial cell (WD-PNEC) cultures. We identify a consistent, rich genetic diversity arising in vitro, variants of which could rapidly rise to near-fixation with 2 passages.

 abstract = {SARS-CoV-2 can efficiently infect both children and adults, albeit with morbidity and mortality positively associated with increasing host age and presence of co-morbidities. SARS-CoV-2 continues to adapt to the human population, resulting in several variants of concern (VOC) with novel properties, such as Alpha and Delta. However, factors driving SARS-CoV-2 fitness and evolution in paediatric cohorts remain poorly explored. Here, we provide evidence that both viral and host factors co-operate to shape SARS-CoV-2 genotypic and phenotypic change in primary airway cell cultures derived from children. Through viral whole-genome sequencing, we explored changes in genetic diversity over time of two pre-VOC clinical isolates of SARS-CoV-2 during passage in paediatric well-differentiated primary nasal epithelial cell (WD-PNEC) cultures and in parallel, in unmodified Vero-derived cell lines. We identified a consistent, rich genetic diversity arising in vitro, variants of which could rapidly rise to near fixation within two passages. Within isolates, SARS-CoV-2 evolution was dependent on host cells, with paediatric WD-PNECs showing a reduced diversity compared to Vero (E6) cells. However, mutations were not shared between strains. Furthermore, comparison of both Vero-grown isolates on WD-PNECs disclosed marked growth attenuation mapping to the loss of the polybasic cleavage site (PBCS) in Spike, while the strain with mutations in Nsp12 (T293I), Spike (P812R) and a truncation of Orf7a remained viable in WD-PNECs. Altogether, our work demonstrates that pre-VOC SARS-CoV-2 efficiently infects paediatric respiratory epithelial cells, and its evolution is restrained compared to Vero (E6) cells, similar to the case of adult cells. We highlight the significant genetic plasticity of SARS-CoV-2 while uncovering an influential role for collaboration between viral and host cell factors in shaping viral evolution and ultimately fitness in human respiratory epithelium.},

 abstract = {Bovine mastitis is a considerable challenge within the dairy industry, causing significant financial losses and threatening public health. The increased occurrence of methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) has provoked difficulties in managing bovine mastitis. Bacteriophage therapy presents a novel treatment strategy to combat MRSA infections, emerging as a possible substitute for antibiotics. This study evaluated the therapeutic potency of a novel bacteriophage cocktail against MRSA mastitis. Two new bacteriophages (vB\_SauR\_SW21 and vB\_SauR\_SW25) with potent lytic activity against MRSA were isolated and characterized. The one-step growth curve displayed a rapid latent period (20–35 min) and substantial burst size (418 and 316 PFU/ cell). In silico analyses have confirmed the absence of antimicrobial resistance or virulence factor-encoding genes within their genomes. According to the results, combining these phages augmented their host range and virulence. The phage cocktail significantly reduced bacterial burden in a BALB/c mastitis model, demonstrating efficacy comparable to antibiotic treatment. Moreover, its administration led to decreased concentrations of IL-1β and TNF-α compared to the negative control group. The bacteriophage cocktail (SW21-SW25) exhibits a promising profile for therapeutic applications and may represent a novel substitute to antibiotics for managing MRSA bovine mastitis.},

Main methods: A manually curated library of 521 phytochemicals (from 19 medicinal plants) was virtually screened using Mcule server and binding interactions were studied using DS Visualiser. Docking thresholds were set based on the scores of standard controls and rigorous ADMET properties were used to finally get the potential inhibitors. Free binding energies of the docked complexes were calculated employing MM-GBSA method. MM-GBSA informed our choice for MD simulation studies performed against NSP9 to study the stability of the drug-receptor interaction. NSP9 structure comparison was also performed. Key findings: Extensive screening of the molecules identified 5 leads for NSP9, 23 for Furin, 18 for ORF3a, and 19 for interleukin-6. Ochnaflavone and Licoflavone B, obtained from Lonicera japonica (Japanese Honeysuckle) and Glycyrrhiza glabra (Licorice), respectively, were identified to have the highest potential multi-target inhibition properties for NSP9, furin, ORF3a, and IL-6. Additionally, molecular dynamics simulation supports the robust stability of Ochnaflavone and Licoflavone B against NSP9 at the active sites via hydrophobic interactions, H-bonding, and H-bonding facilitated by water. Significance: These compounds with the highest drug-like ranking against multiple viral and host targets have the potential to be drug candidates for the treatment of SARS-CoV-2 infection that may possibly act on multiple pathways simultaneously to inhibit viral entry and replication as well as disease progression.},

Here, we investigated multidrug-resistant Klebsiella pneumoniae, a common pathogen of chimpanzees and humans. We screened antibiotic-resistant K. pneumoniae from 48 chimpanzee stools and 38 termite mounds (\textit{n} = 415 samples) collected in protected areas in Senegal. The microsatellite method was used to identify chimpanzee individuals (\textit{n} = 13). Whole-genome sequencing was performed on K. pneumoniae complex isolates to identify antibiotic-resistant genes and characterize clones. We found a high prevalence of carbapenem-resistant K. pneumoniae among chimpanzee isolates (18/48 samples from 7/13 individuals) and ceftriaxone resistance among both chimpanzee individuals (19/48) and termite mounds (7/415 termites and 3/38 termite mounds). The \textit{bla}$_{\textrm{OXA-48}}$ and the \textit{bla}$_{\textrm{KPC-2}}$ genes were carried by international pOXA-48 and pKPC-2 plasmids, respectively. The ESBL plasmid carried \textit{bla}$_{\textrm{CTX-M-15}}$, \textit{bla}$_{\textrm{TEM-1B}}$, and \textit{bla}$_{\textrm{OXA-1}}$ genes. Genome sequencing of 56 isolates identified two major clones associated with hospital-acquired infections of K. pneumoniae (ST307 and ST147) in chimpanzees and termites, suggesting circulation of strains between the two species, as chimpanzees feed on termites. The source and selection pressure of these clones in this environment need to be explored.},

 abstract = {As phosphorus is one of the most limiting nutrients in many natural and agricultural ecosystems, plants have evolved strategies that cope with its scarcity. Genetic approaches have facilitated the identification of several molecular elements that regulate the phosphate (Pi) starvation response (PSR) of plants, including the master regulator of the transcriptional response to phosphate starvation PHOSPHATE STARVATION RESPONSE1 (PHR1). However, the chromatin modifications underlying the plant transcriptional response to phosphate scarcity remain largely unknown. Here, we present a detailed analysis of changes in chromatin accessibility during phosphate starvation in \textit{Arabidopsis thaliana} root cells. Root cells undergo a genome-wide remodeling of chromatin accessibility in response to Pi starvation that is often associated with changes in the transcription of neighboring genes. Analysis of chromatin accessibility in the \textit{phr1 phl2} double mutant revealed that the transcription factors PHR1 and PHL2 play a key role in remodeling chromatin accessibility in response to Pi limitation. We also discovered that PHR1 and PHL2 play an important role in determining chromatin accessibility and the associated transcription of many genes under optimal Pi conditions, including genes involved in the PSR. We propose that a set of transcription factors directly activated by PHR1 in Pi-starved root cells trigger a second wave of epigenetic changes required for the transcriptional activation of the complete set of low-Pi-responsive genes.},

 abstract = {Whole-genome duplication is an evolutionary force that drives speciation in all living kingdoms and is notably prevalent in plants. The evolutionary history of plants involved at least two genomic duplications that significantly expanded the plant morphology and physiology spectrum. Many important crops are polyploids, showing valuable features relative to morphological and stress response traits. After genome duplication, diploidization processes facilitate genomic adjustments to restore disomic inheritance. However, little is known about the chromatin changes triggered by nuclear DNA content alterations. Here, we report that synthetically induced genome duplication leads to chromatinization and significant changes in gene expression, resulting in a transcriptional landscape resembling a natural tetraploid. Interestingly, synthetic diploidization elicits only minor alterations in transcriptional activity and chromatin accessibility compared to the more pronounced effects of tetraploidization. We identified epigenetic factors, including specific histone variants, that showed increased expression following genome duplication and decreased expression after genome reduction. These changes may play a key role in the epigenetic mechanisms underlying the phenotypic complexity after tetraploidization in plants. Our findings shed light on the mechanisms that modulate chromatin accessibility remodeling and gene transcription regulation underlying plant genome adaptation in response to changes in genome size.},

@mastersthesis{barreira_predictability_2024,
 abstract = {Predicting genomic evolution, which is influenced by selection, genetic drift, and population 
history, is a central question in evolutionary biology. This study investigates the genetic basis of 
adaptation in Drosophila subobscura populations that were initially collected from two 
contrasting European latitudes and years, and subsequently underwent independent lab 
adaptation. The goal was to test the predictability of evolution at the genomic level, 
complementing previous research done on phenotypic changes of those populations. 
First approach, I utilised the latest tools and reference genome to recreate existing analysis 
pipelines. I observed some evidence of convergent and parallel evolution, distinct from the 
major signal composed of drift and divergence. No common candidate SNPs were observed 
between populations indicating low repeatability of changes at such level. I also noted major 
genomic changes likely due to selection pressures acting on chromosomal inversion frequencies 
(CIF) across populations. 
After that analysis, I developed custom analysis tools, CAR (coverage adjusted rho) and CDD 
(convergence divergence detection), which analyse more nucleotide data points and differentiate 
between parallel, convergent, and divergent selection. This approach confirmed indication of 
changes in CIF and identified selection peaks across populations, even though the peak regions 
could not be functionally annotated. Most notably, I observed large genomic regions showing 
convergence - likely associated with inversions - while divergence was widespread across the 
genome, likely as a result of genetic drift. I also used these algorithms to successfully detect a 
component of parallel evolution, when comparing populations. 
An ontological functional analysis of candidate regions did not reveal similar motifs across 
populations, suggesting that predictability in evolution might be partially limited to larger 
structures like inversions. Future research with higher coverage data and more comprehensive 
genomic annotation may provide deeper insights into the underlying mechanisms of genomic 
evolution, thereby enhancing the predictability of such changes.},

For its control, strategies that include chemicals are usually used; so, the description of entomopathogens would be very useful for the formulation of biopesticides. In this regard, two different baculoviruses affecting \textit{S. ornithogalli} were isolated in Colombia, with one of them being an NPV and the other a GV. Ultrastructural, molecular, and biological characterization showed that both isolates possess the 38 core genes and are novel species in \textit{Baculoviridae}, named as \textit{Spodoptera ornithogalli nucleopolyhedrovirus} (SporNPV) and \textit{Spodoptera ornithogalli granulovirus} (SporGV). The bioassays carried out in larvae of \textit{S. ornithogalli} and \textit{S. frugiperda} showed infectivity in both hosts but being higher in the first. In addition, it was observed that SporGV potentiates the insecticidal action of SporNPV (maximum value in ratio 2.5:97.5). Both viruses are individually infective but coexist in nature, producing mixed infections with a synergistic effect that improves the performance of the NPV and enables the transmission of the GV, which presents a slowly killing phenotype.},

 abstract = {Objectives
This study aimed to elucidate the genomic background of a carbapenemase-producing Klebsiella quasipneumoniae subsp. similipneumoniae that colonized and infected a patient during hospitalization.
Methods
The isolates recovered from a surveillance swab (isolate CV39) and a subsequent surgical site infection (isolate 415/18) in the same patient were identified, and antimicrobial susceptibility was tested. Biofilm production and genome restriction typing (XbaI-PFGE) were subsequently performed. Last, the first isolate obtained was whole-genome sequenced (WGS) using the MiSeq platform, and online tools were applied for bioinformatic analysis of the relevant information.
Results
Both CV39 and 415/18 were categorized as multidrug-resistant, they exhibited low biofilm production ability, and presented a high genetic similarity (92.9\%) by XbaI-PFGE typing. In view of this, the first isolate was submitted to WGS, which demonstrated that CV39 belonged to the sequence type ST138, expressing the K1 and O5 serotypes. Moreover, it presented genes codifying resistance to all beta-lactams, fosfomycin, fluoroquinolones, and quaternary ammonium compounds, as well as virulence systems comprising fimbriae, iron uptake, and immune bypass. Despite four plasmid incompatibility groups being detected, the IncM1 was identified as responsible for the blaKPC-2 mobilization. Finally, the CV39 genome is closely related to other ST138-K1-K. quasipneumoniae strains isolated around the world.
Conclusions
These results revealed the potential of a colonization scenario by a KPC-2-producing K1 K. quasipneumoniae in progressing to an infectious process in an impaired patient, which may help programs intended to combat antimicrobial resistance.},

 abstract = {Recently, the quest for the mythical fountain of youth has produced extensive research programs that aim to extend the healthy lifespan of humans. Despite advances in our understanding of the aging process, the surprisingly extended lifespan and cancer resistance of some animal species remain unexplained. The p53 protein plays a crucial role in tumor suppression, tissue homeostasis, and aging. Long-lived, cancer-free African elephants have 20 copies of the \textit{TP}53 gene, including 19 retrogenes (38 alleles), which are partially active, whereas humans possess only one copy of \textit{TP}53 and have an estimated cancer mortality rate of 11-25\%. The mechanism through which p53 contributes to the resolution of the Peto's paradox in Animalia remains vague. Thus, in this work, we took advantage of the available datasets and inspected the p53 amino acid sequence of phylogenetically related organisms that show variations in their lifespans. We discovered new correlations between specific amino acid deviations in p53 and the lifespans across different animal species. We found that species with extended lifespans have certain characteristic amino acid substitutions in the p53 DNA-binding domain that alter its function, as depicted from the Phenotypic Annotation of p53 Mutations, using the PROVEAN tool or SWISS-MODEL workflow. In addition, the loop 2 region of the human p53 DNA-binding domain was identified as the longest region that was associated with longevity. The 3D model revealed variations in the loop 2 structure in long-lived species when compared with human p53. Our findings show a direct association between specific amino acid residues in p53 protein, changes in p53 functionality, and the extended animal lifespan, and further highlight the importance of p53 protein in aging.},

However, it replaces soil with hydroponics and the sun with LED lights. Compared with the field, wheat grown indoors showed a much higher yield potential and bread-making quality parameters. Many mineral concentrations were higher due to the unrestricted water supply and nutrients in hydroponics. However, concentrations declined with increasing yields. The microbiome richness inside the grains of wheat grown without soil indoors was still within the range of wheat grown in the field. However, taxa were different among cultivars and treatments. There were differences in the presence of undefined secondary metabolites between indoor and outdoor wheat and across the indoor experiments. Regardless of the growing environment, immunoreactive proteins were present. Indoor-grown wheat had a higher share of ω5-gliadins but lower shares of γ-gliadins and low‐molecular‐weight glutenin subunits, which may affect the gluten protein immunoreactive potential for individuals with wheat-related disorders (allergy and celiac disease). Growing wheat without soil and sunlight indoors can produce high-yielding, high-quality grains. However, the food quality and health aspects associated with gluten proteins might deteriorate with a further, theoretically possible, yield increase in a controlled growing environment.},

 abstract = {Social insects’ nests harbor intruders known as inquilines,1 which are usually related to their hosts.2,3 However, distant non-social inquilines may also show convergences with their hosts,4,5 although the underlying genomic changes remain unclear. We analyzed the genome of the wingless and blind bee louse fly Braula coeca, an inquiline kleptoparasite of the western honey bee, Apis mellifera.6,7 Using large phylogenomic data, we confirmed recent accounts that the bee louse fly is a drosophilid8,9 and showed that it had likely evolved from a sap-breeder ancestor associated with honeydew and scale insects’ wax. Unlike many parasites, the bee louse fly genome did not show significant erosion or strict reliance on an endosymbiont, likely due to a relatively recent age of inquilinism. However, we observed a horizontal transfer of a transposon and a striking parallel evolution in a set of gene families between the honey bee and the bee louse fly. Convergences included genes potentially involved in metabolism and immunity and the loss of nearly all bitter-tasting gustatory receptors, in agreement with life in a protective nest and a diet of honey, pollen, and beeswax. Vision and odorant receptor genes also exhibited rapid losses. Only genes whose orthologs in the closely related Drosophila melanogaster respond to honey bee pheromone components or floral aroma were retained, whereas the losses included orthologous receptors responsive to the anti-ovarian honey bee queen pheromones. Hence, deep genomic convergences can underlie major phenotypic transitions during the evolution of inquilinism between non-social parasites and their social hosts.},

 abstract = {Spermatogenesis is a complex biological process encompasses several stages of cellular divisions, ultimately resulting in producing mature spermatozoa capable of fertilization. Numerous factors involved in the precise regulation of the spermatogenesis, and any disruptions or alterations in these regulatory mechanisms can lead to spermatogenesis arrest, which may result in male infertility. Among these factors, genetic influences play essential role in regulating the process. This study aimed to identify genes that are differentially expressed in relation to spermatogenesis arrest. Testicular biopsy samples were collected from 22 non-obstructive azoospermic patients diagnosed with spermatogenesis arrest (cases) and nine obstructive azoospermic patients (controls). RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) was performed on five samples from the 22 non-obstructive azoospermic patients and compared to previously published transcriptomic data from obstructive azoospermic patients, which served as the control group. Differential expression analysis of the RNA-seq data identified 1,915 differentially expressed genes, comprising 337 upregulated and 1,578 downregulated genes. Among these, several key candidate genes were identified for further analysis, including the upregulation of FOS, FOSB, RGS1, and CXCL8, as well as the downregulation of TNP2, SPRR2C, LINC02314, and C16orf78. RT-qPCR validation confirmed the RNA-seq findings for these genes in the tested samples. Subsequently, RT-qPCR was performed on the remaining 17 non-obstructive (n = 17) and obstructive azoospermic samples (n = 9) collected in this study. The results from these additional samples were consistent with the RNA-seq data, further supporting the findings. Using gene ontology (GO) analysis and published literature, we linked these genes with spermatogenesis arrest, identifying promising targets that could serve as potential biomarkers for this condition in the future.},

 abstract = {Astyanax mexicanus is a well-known model species, that has two morphotypes, cavefish, from subterranean rivers and surface fish, from surface rivers. They are morphologically distinct due to many troglomorphic traits in the cavefish, such as the absence of eyes. Most studies on A. mexicanus are focused on eye development and protein-coding genes involved in the process. However, lncRNAs did not get the same attention and very little is known about them. This study aimed to fill this knowledge gap, identifying, describing, classifying, and annotating lncRNAs expressed in the embryo’s eye tissue of cavefish and surface fish. To do so, we constructed a concise workflow to assemble and evaluate transcriptomes, annotate protein-coding genes, ncRNAs families, predict the coding potential, identify putative lncRNAs, map them and predict interactions. This approach resulted in the identification of 33,069 and 19,493 putative lncRNAs respectively mapped in cavefish and surface fish. Thousands of these lncRNAs were annotated and identified as conserved in human and several species of fish. Hundreds of them were validated in silico, through ESTs. We identified lncRNAs associated with genes related to eye development. This is the case of a few lncRNAs associated with sox2, which we suggest being isomorphs of the SOX2-OT, a lncRNA that can regulate the expression of sox2. This work is one of the first studies to focus on the description of lncRNAs in A. mexicanus, highlighting several lncRNA targets and opening an important precedent for future studies focusing on lncRNAs expressed in A. mexicanus.},

 abstract = {Epithelial ovarian cancer (EOC) is the most lethal disease of the female reproductive tract, and although most patients respond to the initial treatment with platinum (cPt)-based compounds, relapse is very common. We investigated the role of epigenetic changes in cPt-sensitive and -resistant EOC cell lines and found distinct differences in their enhancer landscape. Clinical data revealed that two genes (JAK1 and FGF10), which gained large enhancer clusters in resistant EOC cell lines, could provide novel biomarkers for early patient stratification with statistical independence for JAK1. To modulate the enhancer remodeling process and prevent the acquisition of cPt resistance in EOC cells, we performed a chromatin-focused RNAi screen in the presence of cPt. We identified subunits of the Nucleosome Remodeling and Deacetylase (NuRD) complex as critical factors sensitizing the EOC cell line A2780 to platinum treatment. Suppression of the Methyl-CpG Binding Domain Protein 3 (MBD3) sensitized cells and prevented the establishment of resistance under prolonged cPt exposure through alterations of H3K27ac at enhancer regions, which are differentially regulated in cPt-resistant cells, leading to a less aggressive phenotype. Our work establishes JAK1 as an independent prognostic marker and the NuRD complex as a potential target for combinational therapy.},

@article{bawin_cuscuta_2024,
 abstract = {The Cuscuta genus comprises obligate parasitic plants that have an unusually wide host range. Whether Cuscuta uses different infection strategies for different hosts or whether the infection strategy is mechanistically and enzymatically conserved remains unknown. To address this, we investigated molecular events during the interaction between field dodder (Cuscuta campestris) and two host species of the Solanum genus that are known to react differently to parasitic infection. We found that host gene induction, particularly of cell wall fortifying genes, coincided with a differential induction of genes for cell wall degradation in the parasite in the cultivated tomato (Solanum lycopersicum) but not in a wild relative (Solanum pennellii). This indicates that the parasite can adjust its gene expression in response to its host. This idea was supported by the increased expression of C. campestris genes encoding an endo-β-1,4-mannanase in response to exposure of the parasite to purified mono- and polysaccharides in a host-independent infection system. Our results suggest multiple key roles of the host cell wall in determining the outcome of an infection attempt.},

Further analysis of the genome revealed that Lactobacillus delbrueckii ssp. lactis strain named A4 could play the role of a probiotic endosymbiont because of the presence of intact genetic sequences determining antioxidant properties, exopolysaccharides synthesis, adhesion properties, and biofilm formation, as well as an antagonistic activity against some pathogens which is not due to pH or bacteriocins production. Additionally, the genomic analysis revealed significant potential for stress tolerance, such as extreme pH, osmotic stress, and high temperature. To our knowledge, this is the first report of a potentially endosymbiotic Lactobacillus delbrueckii ssp. lactis strain adapted to and playing beneficial roles for its host.},

MicroRNA-21 is among the strongest upregulated microRNAs in human COVID-19 and in mice with acute inflammatory lung damage, and it is the strongest expressed microRNA in pulmonary macrophages. Chemical linkage of a microRNA-21 inhibitor to trimannose achieves rapid and specific delivery to macrophages upon inhalation in mice. RCS-21 reverses pathological activation of macrophages and prevents pulmonary dysfunction and fibrosis after acute lung damage in mice. In human lung tissue infected with SARS-CoV-2 ex vivo, RCS-21 effectively prevents the exaggerated inflammatory response.

Recent evidence indicates a role of inflammation in promoting VS growth. Therefore, our study aimed to identify cytokines, which are associated with larger VSs. The expression of different cytokines in VS tumor samples and VS primary cultures was investigated. Additionally, the concentration of cytokines in cell culture supernatants of VS primary cultures and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) of VS patients and healthy controls were determined. Correlation analysis of cytokine levels with tumor volume, growth rate, Koos grade, age, and hearing was examined with Spearman’s-rank test. The mRNA expression of CC-chemokine ligand (CCL) 18, growth differentiation factor (GDF) 15, and interferon regulatory factor 4 correlated positively with tumor volume. Moreover, the amount of GDF15 in the cell culture supernatant of primary cells correlated positively with tumor volume. The concentrations of the cytokines CCL2, CCL5, and CCL18 and transforming growth factor beta (TGFB) 1 in the CSF of the patients were significantly different from those in the CSF controls. Inhibition of immune cell infiltration could be a putative approach to prevent and control VS growth.},

 abstract = {SARS-CoV-2 is a highly contagious respiratory virus and the causative agent for COVID-19. The severity of disease varies from mildly symptomatic to lethal and shows an extraordinary correlation with increasing age, which represents the major risk factor for severe COVID-19 1 . However, the precise pathomechanisms leading to aggravated disease in the elderly are currently unknown. Delayed and insufficient antiviral immune responses early after infection as well as dysregulated and overshooting immunopathological processes late during disease were suggested as possible mechanisms. Here we show that the age-dependent increase of COVID-19 severity is caused by the disruption of a timely and well-coordinated innate and adaptive immune response due to impaired interferon (IFN) responses. To overcome the limitations of mechanistic studies in humans, we generated a mouse model for severe COVID-19 and compared the kinetics of the immune responses in adult and aged mice at different time points after infection. Aggravated disease in aged mice was characterized by a diminished IFN-γ response and excessive virus replication. Accordingly, adult IFN-γ receptor-deficient mice phenocopied the age-related disease severity and supplementation of IFN-γ reversed the increased disease susceptibility of aged mice. Mimicking impaired type I IFN immunity in adult and aged mice, a second major risk factor for severe COVID-19 2–4 , we found that therapeutic treatment with IFN-λ in adult and a combinatorial treatment with IFN-γ and IFN-λ in aged Ifnar1 -/- mice was highly efficient in protecting against severe disease. Our findings provide an explanation for the age-dependent disease severity of COVID-19 and clarify the nonredundant antiviral functions of type I, II and III IFNs during SARS-CoV-2 infection in an age-dependent manner. Based on our data, we suggest that highly vulnerable individuals combining both risk factors, advanced age and an impaired type I IFN immunity, may greatly benefit from immunotherapy combining IFN-γ and IFN-λ.},

We report findings from a large-scale replicated EW field trial across a typical maize-soybean rotation on an experimental farm in the heart of the United Sates Corn Belt over 4 y (2016 to 2020). We show an average combined loss of major cations (Ca2+ and Mg2+) from crushed basalt applied each fall over 4 y (50 t ha−1 y−1) gave a conservative time-integrated cumulative CDR potential of 10.5 ± 3.8 t CO2 ha−1.

Yield enhancements with EW were achieved with significantly (P {\textless} 0.05) increased key micro- and macronutrient concentrations (including potassium, magnesium, manganese, phosphorus, and zinc), thus improving or maintaining crop nutritional status. We observed no significant increase in the content of trace metals in grains of maize or soybean or soil exchangeable pools relative to controls.

@article{belair_botryosphaeriaceae_2023,
 abstract = {The Botryosphaeriaceae family comprises numerous fungal pathogens capable of causing economically meaningful diseases in a wide range of crops. Many of its members can live as endophytes and turn into aggressive pathogens following the onset of environmental stress events. Their ability to cause disease may rely on the production of a broad set of effectors, such as cell wall-degrading enzymes, secondary metabolites, and peptidases. Here, we conducted comparative analyses of 41 genomes representing six Botryosphaeriaceae genera to provide insights into the genetic features linked to pathogenicity and virulence. We show that these Botryosphaeriaceae genomes possess a large diversity of carbohydrate-active enzymes (CAZymes; 128 families) and peptidases (45 families). Botryosphaeria, Neofusicoccum, and Lasiodiplodia presented the highest number of genes encoding CAZymes involved in the degradation of the plant cell wall components. The genus Botryosphaeria also exhibited the highest abundance of secreted CAZymes and peptidases. Generally, the secondary metabolites gene cluster profile was consistent in the Botryosphaeriaceae family, except for Diplodia and Neoscytalidium. At the strain level, Neofusicoccum parvum NpBt67 stood out among all the Botryosphaeriaceae genomes, presenting a higher number of secretome constituents. In contrast, the Diplodia strains showed the lowest richness of the pathogenicity- and virulence-related genes, which may correlate with their low virulence reported in previous studies. Overall, these results contribute to a better understanding of the mechanisms underlying pathogenicity and virulence in remarkable Botryosphaeriaceae species. Our results also support that Botryosphaeriaceae species could be used as an interesting biotechnological tool for lignocellulose fractionation and bioeconomy.},

@article{ben-oz_dual_2023,
 abstract = {p53-mediated cell cycle arrest during DNA damage is dependent on the induction of p21 protein, encoded by the CDKN1A gene. p21 inhibits cyclin-dependent kinases required for cell cycle progression to guarantee accurate repair of DNA lesions. Hence, fine-tuning of p21 levels is crucial to preserve genomic stability. Currently, the multilayered regulation of p21 levels during DNA damage is not fully understood. Herein, we identify the human RNA binding motif protein 42 (RBM42) as a regulator of p21 levels during DNA damage. Genome-wide transcriptome and interactome analysis reveals that RBM42 alters the expression of p53-regulated genes during DNA damage. Specifically, we demonstrate that RBM42 facilitates CDKN1A splicing by counteracting the splicing inhibitory effect of RBM4 protein. Unexpectedly, we also show that RBM42, underpins translation of various splicing targets, including CDKN1A. Concordantly, transcriptome-wide mapping of RBM42-RNA interactions using eCLIP further substantiates the dual function of RBM42 in regulating splicing and translation of its target genes, including CDKN1A. Collectively, our data show that RBM42 couples splicing and translation machineries to fine-tune gene expression during DNA damage response.},

 abstract = {Suberin is a hydrophobic biopolymer that acts as an internal and external diffusion and transpiration barrier in plants. It is involved in two phases of wound healing, i.e. initial closing layer formation and subsequent wound periderm development. Transcriptomic and metabolomic analyses of wounded potato leaf tissue revealed preferential induction of cell wall modifying processes during closing layer formation, accompanied by a highly active defense response. To address the importance of suberin in this process, we generated loss of function mutants by CRISPR-Cas9 editing the suberin transporter gene StABCG1. Both wound-induced StABCG1 transcript levels and suberin formation around wounded leaf tissue were reduced in CRISPR-lines. Moreover, wound-induced tissue damage was characterized by browning of wound-adjacent areas. Transcriptome analyses of these areas revealed up-regulation of genes encoding defense proteins and enzymes of the phenylpropanoid pathway. Levels of hydroxycinnamic acid amides, acting in defense and in cell wall reinforcement, were drastically enhanced in CRISPR compared to control plants. These results suggest that the reduction in suberin formation around wounded tissue leads to a loss of barrier function, resulting in tissue browning due to enhanced exposure to oxygen.},

@article{bennett-keki_sex-biased_2023,
 abstract = {Differences in lifespan between males and females are found across many taxa and may be determined, at least in part, by differential responses to diet. Here we tested the hypothesis that the higher dietary sensitivity of female lifespan is mediated by higher and more dynamic expression in nutrient-sensing pathways in females. We first reanalysed existing RNA-seq data, focusing on 17 nutrient-sensing genes with reported lifespan effects. This revealed, consistent with the hypothesis, a dominant pattern of female-biased gene expression, and among sex-biased genes there tended to be a loss of female-bias after mating. We then tested directly the expression of these 17 nutrient-sensing genes in wild-type third instar larvae, once-mated 5- and 16-day-old adults. This confirmed sex-biased gene expression and showed that it was generally absent in larvae, but frequent and stable in adults. Overall, the findings suggest a proximate explanation for the sensitivity of female lifespan to dietary manipulations. We suggest that the contrasting selective pressures to which males and females are subject create differing nutritional demands and requirements, resulting in sex differences in lifespan. This underscores the potential importance of the health impacts of sex-specific dietary responses.},

Beta-glucans, structural polysaccharides found in yeast cell walls, have emerged as promising modulators of immune function and microbial ecology. Cava lees, a by-product of sparkling wine production composed of \&lt;i\&gt;Saccharomyces cerevisiae\&lt;/i\&gt; cell walls, represent a rich source of beta-glucans that could be upcycled for nutritional and therapeutic applications.\&lt;h4\&gt;Methods\&lt;/h4\&gt;Twenty-four Wistar rats (12 males, 12 females) were randomly divided into control and treatment groups. The treatment group received daily doses of 2,000 mg lees/kg body weight for 14 days. Shotgun metagenomic analysis was performed to assess microbial composition and functional changes.\&lt;h4\&gt;Results\&lt;/h4\&gt;A 14-day cava lees supplementation study revealed significant shifts in gut microbiota composition and function. Baseline microbiota was dominated by Bacillota (64-72\%) and Bacteroidota (23-32\%) with sex-specific differences at the family level. Post-supplementation analysis showed increased Shannon diversity across both sexes, with beneficial enrichment of \&lt;i\&gt;Bifidobacteriaceae\&lt;/i\&gt; and \&lt;i\&gt;Rikenellaceae\&lt;/i\&gt; families and reduction of \&lt;i\&gt;Eubacteriaceae\&lt;/i\&gt;. While global metabolic profiles remained stable, targeted functional pathways were significantly changed, including butyrate production genes. Females exhibited particularly elevated secondary bile acid modification genes (Mann-Whitney-Wilcoxon test \&lt;i\&gt;p\&lt;/i\&gt; = 0.032), and male oxidative stress response pathways (Mann-Whitney-Wilcoxon test \&lt;i\&gt;p\&lt;/i\&gt; = 0.016) showing both a potentially sex-dependent responses to dietary intervention.\&lt;h4\&gt;Conclusion\&lt;/h4\&gt;Working with healthy individuals provides a clear understanding of the normal, baseline microbiota composition and function before any intervention. These findings suggest a degree of plasticity of the gut microbiome and its responsiveness to dietary modifications. Beta-glucans from cava lees appear to create a favorable environment for beneficial bacteria, with sex-specific changes of certain bacterial families and functions. These findings provide a foundation for future translational research in humans. Nonetheless, to establish their true impact on human health, these observations in rodent models must be validated through appropriately designed human clinical studies.},

 abstract = {Gut microbiota enable wood-feeding insects to digest recalcitrant diets. Two DNA-based analyses were performed. Amplicon sequencing of gut microbiota samples from Cryptocercus punctulatus showed inter-individual heterogeneity with visually distinct ordination patterns; however, no statistically significant differences were detected. Shotgun metagenomics was used to compare the taxonomic and functional profiles of C. punctulatus gut microbiota with those of other xylophagous Dictyoptera. Despite taxonomic differences, C. punctulatus microbiota revealed functional convergence with termites (Mastotermes darwiniensis and Nasutitermes sp.). Carbohydrate metabolism was performed by different bacterial phyla across all insects. All insect species possessed metabolic potential for cellulose, hemicellulose, pectin, and starch digestion, but lignin degradation capabilities were not detected. Termites showed higher abundance of chitin and xylan degradation pathways and nitrogen fixation genes, though nitrogen fixation was also present in Cryptocercus cockroaches. Genes for oxidative stress tolerance were present across all species but were most abundant in cockroaches, particularly, Cryptocercus. All insects harbored antibiotic resistance genes, with highest levels found in cockroaches. These findings indicate that metabolic requirements for wood digestion shape gut microbial community assembly across xylophagous insects, with distinct microbial taxa contributing to cellulose and hemicellulose breakdown. Moreover, the widespread presence of antibiotic resistance genes raises concerns about the potential transmission of antibiotic resistance within insect-associated microbiomes.},

This study examines the combined effects of ocean acidification (OA), ocean warming (OW), and microplastics (MP) loaded with chlorpyrifos (CPF), a broad-spectrum organophosphate insecticide, on sea urchin larvae, evaluating growth and molecular endpoints. Experimental treatments simulated future ocean conditions predicted for 2100, exposing larvae to varying temperature and pH levels, alongside CPF-contaminated MP. RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) was utilized to assess gene expression changes, revealing significant transcriptional shifts in metabolic, cellular, and developmental pathways. Morphological responses showed reduced larval growth, exacerbated under OA and OW conditions. Molecular analyses identified key upregulated pathways associated with stress response, including nitrogen metabolism and extracellular matrix remodelling, while downregulated genes involved DNA stability, cell cycle regulation, and enzymatic activities. These findings suggest a dual compensatory and deleterious response to combined stressors. Notably, temperature acted as a modulator of stressor effects, amplifying oxidative stress and metabolic costs at higher temperatures. Potential biomarkers, such as genes involved in actin regulation and embryonic development, were identified, offering possible tools for early detection of environmental stress. This study highlights the compounded impacts of anthropogenic and climate-induced stressors on marine invertebrates, emphasizing the need for integrative molecular approaches in ecotoxicology. Our findings contribute to the understanding of organismal adaptation and vulnerability in the face of global climate change and pollution, informing conservation strategies for marine ecosystems.},

Although molecular data exist for L. erratica, none were available for L. gryllorum. To address this gap, gregarine specimens were isolated from an A. domesticus colony and examined using integrated morphological and molecular approaches. Hybrid genome sequencing with Illumina and Nanopore platforms yielded a high-quality L. gryllorum assembly, which enabled the design of specific 18S primers and subsequent phylogenetic analyses that revealed 91.6–92.6\% similarity to the L. erratica reference. Genome annotation revealed a partial ubiquinol-cytochrome c reductase, consistent with previous observations of reduced mitochondrial function in eugregarines. Functional annotation using eggNOG, InterProScan, and KEGG mapping uncovered genes involved in amino acid, carbohydrate, and nucleotide metabolism, while GO analysis highlighted a diverse functional repertoire. Data mining of NCBI cricket sequencing datasets further identified additional putative Leidyana 18S sequences in various Gryllidae hosts, confirming a broader host range. Eventually, phylogenomic analyses placed L. gryllorum within the Gregarinoidea clade near the root of terrestrial gregarines, supporting its status as an early-diverging lineage.},

@article{bessonov_ectyper_2021,
 abstract = {\textit{Escherichia coli} is a priority foodborne pathogen of public health concern and phenotypic serotyping provides critical information for surveillance and outbreak detection activities. Public health and food safety laboratories are increasingly adopting whole-genome sequencing (WGS) for characterizing pathogens, but it is imperative to maintain serotype designations in order to minimize disruptions to existing public health workflows. Multiple \textit{in silico} tools have been developed for predicting serotypes from WGS data, including SRST2, SerotypeFinder and EToKi EBEis, but these tools were not designed with the specific requirements of diagnostic laboratories, which include: speciation, input data flexibility (fasta/fastq), quality control information and easily interpretable results. To address these specific requirements, we developed ECTyper (https://github.com/phac-nml/ecoli\_serotyping) for performing both speciation within \textit{Escherichia} and \textit{Shigella}, and \textit{in silico} serotype prediction. We compared the serotype prediction performance of each tool on a newly sequenced panel of 185 isolates with confirmed phenotypic serotype information. We found that all tools were highly concordant, with 92-97 \% for O-antigens and 98-100 \% for H-antigens, and ECTyper having the highest rate of concordance. We extended the benchmarking to a large panel of 6954 publicly available \textit{E. coli} genomes to assess the performance of the tools on a more diverse dataset. On the public data, there was a considerable drop in concordance, with 75-91 \% for O-antigens and 62-90 \% for H-antigens, and ECTyper and SerotypeFinder being the most concordant. This study highlights that \textit{in silico} predictions show high concordance with phenotypic serotyping results, but there are notable differences in tool performance. ECTyper provides highly accurate and sensitive \textit{in silico} serotype predictions, in addition to speciation, and is designed to be easily incorporated into bioinformatic workflows.},

 abstract = {{\textless}h2{\textgreater}Summary{\textless}/h2{\textgreater}{\textless}p{\textgreater}TFIID is an essential basal transcription factor, crucial for RNA polymerase II (pol II) promoter recognition and transcription initiation. The TFIID complex consists of the TATA binding protein (TBP) and 13 TBP-associated factors (TAFs) that contain intrinsically disordered regions (IDRs) with currently unknown functions. Here, we show that a conserved IDR drives TAF2 to nuclear speckle condensates independently of other TFIID subunits. Quantitative mass spectrometry analyses reveal TAF2 proximity to RNA splicing factors including specific interactions of the TAF2 IDR with SRRM2 in nuclear speckles. Deleting the IDR from TAF2 does not majorly impact global gene expression but results in changes of alternative splicing events. Further, genome-wide binding analyses suggest that the TAF2 IDR impedes TAF2 promoter association by guiding TAF2 to nuclear speckles. This study demonstrates that an IDR within the large multiprotein complex TFIID controls nuclear compartmentalization and thus links distinct molecular processes, namely transcription initiation and RNA splicing.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

This study aims to investigate the long-term epidemiology of Verona integron-encoded metallo-β-lactamase (VIM)-producing E. coli in the health district of Bolzano, Northern Italy, by examining the phenotypic and genotypic characteristics of 26 isolates obtained during 2005–2020. Isolates were identified with matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization time-of-flight, susceptibility testing was by Vitek 2, Sensititre, and Etest; carbapenemase activity was confirmed by Etest and Carbapenemase Inactivation Method (CIM) test; and the VIM-antigen was identified by the NG-Test CARBA 5. Genome sequencing was performed on an Illumina MiSeq platform. Carbapenem minimum inhibitory concentrations varied across methodologies, and overall category agreement between phenotypic methods was low. All 23 sequenced isolates contained blaVIM-1. Eleven (47.8\%) isolates belonged to the clonal lineage ST131, with fimH30 being the most common subclone. In Bolzano ST131-fimH30 was present as early as 2005. While the ST131 clonal lineage predominated for the first 10 years, various clonal lineages were present, especially in subsequent years, indicating the concurrent circulation of multiple clonal lineages. Future efforts should focus on the implementation of surveillance methods, including genomic analysis, as well as the use of updated infection control strategies and antibiotic stewardship programs to prevent the spread of these carbapenem-resistant strains.},

During the pandemic, cases of COVID-19 were aggravated by secondary infections because of impaired immunity and medical interventions, which was clearly evident in the second wave of COVID-19 in India. The potential dangers and clinical difficulties of bacterial and fungal secondary infections in COVID-19 patients necessitate microbial exploration of the URT. In this regard, mass spectrometry (MS)-based proteome data of nasopharyngeal swab samples from COVID-19 patients was used to investigate the metaproteome. The MS datasets were searched against a comprehensive protein sequence database of common URT pathogens using multiple search platforms (MaxQuant, MSFragger, and Search GUI/PeptideShaker). The detected microbial peptides were verified using PepQuery, which analyses peptide-spectrum pairs to give statistical output for determining confident microbial peptides. Finally, a protein sequence database was generated using the list of verified microbial peptides for identification and quantitation of microbial peptides and proteins, respectively. The taxonomic analysis of the detected peptides revealed several opportunistic pathogens like Streptococcus pneumoniae, Rhizopus microsporus, Clavispora lusitaniae , and Syncephalastrum racemosum among others. Using parallel reaction monitoring (PRM), we validated a few identified microbial peptides in clinical samples. The analysis also revealed proteins belonging to species like Pseudomonas fluorescens, Enterobacter , and Clostridium to be up-regulated in severe COVID-19 samples. Thus, MS can serve as a powerful tool for untargeted detection of a wide range of microorganisms. Metaproteomic analysis in COVID-19 patients for early identification and characterisation of co-infecting microorganisms can significantly impact the diagnosis and treatment of patients.},

Despite significant progress in clinical research, conventional surgical and clinical interventions remain the primary treatment options for meningioma. Several proteomics and transcriptomics studies have identified potential markers and altered biological pathways; however, comprehensive exploration and data integration can help to achieve an in-depth understanding of the altered pathobiology. This study applied integrated meta-analysis strategies to proteomic and transcriptomic datasets comprising 48 tissue samples, identifying around 1832 common genes/proteins to explore the underlying mechanism in high-grade meningioma tumorigenesis. The in silico pathway analysis indicated the roles of extracellular matrix organization (EMO) and integrin binding cascades in regulating the apoptosis, angiogenesis, and proliferation responsible for the pathobiology. Subsequently, the expression of pathway components was validated in an independent cohort of 32 fresh frozen tissue samples using multiple reaction monitoring (MRM), confirming their expression in high-grade meningioma. Furthermore, proteome-level changes in EMO and integrin cell surface interactions were investigated in a high-grade meningioma (IOMM-Lee) cell line by inhibiting integrin-linked kinase (ILK). Inhibition of ILK by administrating Cpd22 demonstrated an anti-proliferative effect, inducing apoptosis and downregulating proteins associated with proliferation and metastasis, which provides mechanistic insight into the disease pathophysiology.},

 abstract = {When exposed single-stranded DNA accumulates at stalled or collapsed replication forks, the replication stress response is triggered to prevent genome instability. Leishmania are parasitic eukaryotes where gene expression is universally polycistronic and whose plastic genomes facilitate rapid adaptations in response to stress, with evidence implicating intrinsic replication stress as a source. Little is known about the Leishmania replication stress response. In this study, we reveal the global dynamics of the replication stress response in L. major promastigotes by performing ChIP-seq on three key replication stress response proteins, γH2A, RPA1 and RAD9, in the absence and presence of replication stress. We show that common ‘hotspots’ of replication stress correlate with DNA replication initiation and transcription termination in Leishmania . When DNA replication is stalled, replication stress response factors accumulate at early S-phase origins, with a signal pattern reminiscent of bidirectional replication fork progression. Under conditions of chronic replication stress, increased accumulation of replication stress response factors emerges at wider sites of transcription initiation, suggesting Leishmania may possess compensatory strategies to limit the effects of replication stress and ensure DNA replication can complete under these conditions. In contrast, chronic replication stress enhances RSR factor accumulation at transcription termination sites, highlighting these regions as key replication stress ‘hotspots’ in Leishmania . Lastly, variations in RPA dynamics in ATR-deficient cells uncover crucial roles of this protein kinase in managing polycistronic transcription and DNA replication, particularly under replication stress, in Leishmania . {\textless}h4{\textgreater}Summary{\textless}/h4{\textgreater} Strict controls operate to precisely copy an organism’s DNA. However, cells need ways to rapidly adapt and respond to stimuli. In some cases, these beneficial adaptations come from problems during replication. Leishmania parasites cause serious neglected infections in humans and animals across the world’s tropics and sub-tropics. Remarkably, recent evidence suggests that Leishmania DNA experiences enhanced stress during replication that can drive its ability to rapidly adapt in response to stress. How L eishmania respond to DNA replication stress is still poorly understood. Here, using a genome-wide approach to map the locations of key proteins that manage DNA replication stress and maintain genome integrity, we show ‘hotspots’ of DNA replication stress coincide with start sites of DNA replication and regions of transcription termination.},

We recently experienced an outbreak of Escherichia coli culture lysis in our Melbourne-based structural biology labs that halted protein production despite our use of T1-resistant (TonA/FhuA-disrupted) strains. Genetic analysis of the isolated phage yielded a 45,053 bp genome showing 80–90\% identity with multiple Rtp-like siphophages, and transmission electron microscopy images were consistent with this classification. Further analysis revealed that our isolate was nearly identical to a highly virulent lytic coliphage MSK, recently isolated in Hangzhou, China, whose host receptor has not been determined. Sequence and structural modelling analysis of its putative receptor-binding protein suggested that its terminal receptor was likely to be LptD, an essential outer membrane protein involved in lipopolysaccharide transport. Based on a recent report of spontaneously arising mutations that blocked infection by other LptD-dependent bacteriophages, we designed a targeted genomic LptD loop deletion that successfully generated resistance to vB\_EcoS\_OzMSK in E. coli BL21(DE3) without apparent detriment to fitness. Here, we report a CRISPR-based, single-plasmid solution that will benefit other labs or facilities experiencing challenges due to LptD-dependent lytic phage outbreaks.},

 abstract = {DNA methyltransferase inhibitors (DNMTi) approved for older AML patients are clinically tested in combination with histone deacetylase inhibitors (HDACi). The mechanism of action of these drugs is still under debate. In colon cancer cells, 5-aza-2′-deoxycytidine (DAC) can downregulate oncogenes and metabolic genes by reversing gene body DNA methylation, thus implicating gene body methylation as a novel drug target. We asked whether DAC-induced gene body demethylation in AML cells is also associated with gene repression, and whether the latter is enhanced by HDACi. Transcriptome analyses revealed that a combined treatment with DAC and the HDACi panobinostat or valproic acid affected significantly more transcripts than the sum of the genes regulated by either treatment alone, demonstrating a quantitative synergistic effect on genome-wide expression in U937 cells. This effect was particularly striking for downregulated genes. Integrative methylome and transcriptome analyses showed that a massive downregulation of genes, including oncogenes (e.g., MYC) and epigenetic modifiers (e.g., KDM2B, SUV39H1) often overexpressed in cancer, was associated predominantly with gene body DNA demethylation and changes in acH3K9/27. These findings have implications for the mechanism of action of combined epigenetic treatments, and for a better understanding of responses in trials where this approach is clinically tested.},

 abstract = {The human silencing hub (HUSH) complex is a transcription-dependent, epigenetic repressor complex that provides a genome-wide immunosurveillance system for the recognition and silencing of newly-integrated retroelements. The core HUSH complex of TASOR, MPP8 and Periphilin, represses these retroelements through SETDB1-mediated H3K9me3 deposition and MORC2-dependent chromatin compaction. HUSH-dependent silencing is RNA-mediated, yet no HUSH component contains a recognised RNA-binding domain. Here we used an unbiased approach to identify which HUSH component was able to bind RNA and determine whether RNA-binding was essential for HUSH function. We identify Periphilin as the major RNA-binding component of the HUSH complex and show that Periphilin's N-terminal domain is essential for both RNA binding and HUSH function. Periphilin binding to RNA was independent of its interaction with TASOR or MPP8, as its N-terminal domain was sufficient for RNA targeting. The artificial tethering of Periphilin to a HUSH-insensitive, nascent transcript, enabled the HUSH-dependent silencing of the transcript. This tethering of Periphilin allowed the RNA-binding region of Periphilin to be removed such that only its C-terminal domain was required for oligomerisation and interaction with TASOR. We therefore show that Periphilin is the predominant RNA-binding protein of the HUSH complex and this RNA-binding is essential for HUSH activity.The Human Silencing Hub (HUSH) complex provides a genome-wide immunosurveillance system which protects our genome from invading foreign retroelements, such as HIV-like viruses. HUSH is an epigenetic repressor complex that must distinguish these foreign invaders from our own host genes, and immediately silence the invaders. This silencing by HUSH is dependent on RNA transcription, implying at least one of the three core HUSH components binds RNA. Here we identify Periphilin as the major RNA-binding protein of the HUSH complex. We show that RNA-binding by Periphilin is essential for HUSH activity and that artificially recruiting Periphilin to an RNA transcript silences that transcript.},

 abstract = {Introduction
Catecholamines such as adrenaline and noradrenaline are key regulators of cardiac function in response to increased demand due to stress, illness, or injury, and are used as therapeutic drugs in intensive care medicine. Continuous overactivation of adrenergic receptors, e.g. in heart failure, clearly aggravates detrimental cardiac remodeling, however, whether transient adrenergic stimulation causes persistent myocardial injury remains debated. In this study, we asked whether the structural alterations of the heart induced by adrenergic stimulation are reversible and investigated the molecular mechanisms involved in the remodeling and reverse remodeling process.
Methods and results
Wild-type mice were assigned to 14 days treatment with isoprenaline and phenylephrine (IsoPE), treatment with IsoPE and subsequent recovery, or healthy control groups. IsoPE induced substantial cardiac fibrosis and hypertrophy without signs of functional impairment during echocardiography. RNA sequencing from cardiomyocyte nuclei isolated by flow cytometry revealed marked changes in gene expression after IsoPE treatment (295 differentially expressed genes) related to transforming growth factor signaling, vasculature development, or extracellular matrix organization. Analysis of enhancer regions that were linked to differentially expressed genes identified AP-1 family members Jun and Fos as key drivers of these processes and predicted their direct target genes in cardiomyocytes. IsoPE induced marked changes in the gene expression of adrenergic receptors and their downstream signaling pathways in cardiomyocytes that may be related to receptor desensitization. Within two weeks after IsoPE withdrawal, structural remodeling of the heart recovered and {\textasciitilde}95 \% of genes that were differentially expressed with IsoPE treatment returned to baseline expression.
Conclusion
We demonstrate here that prolonged catecholamine treatment at doses that induce left ventricular hypercontractility, but no overt heart failure, resulted in significant yet reversible cardiac injury. Immediate early transcription factors such as Jun and Fos were identified as main drivers of IsoPE induced pathological gene expression in cardiomyocytes.},

 abstract = {The influx of whole genome sequencing (WGS) data in the public health and clinical diagnostic sectors has created a need for data analysis methods and bioinformatics expertise, which can be a bottleneck for many laboratories. At Sciensano, the Belgian national public health institute, an intuitive and user-friendly bioinformatics tool portal was implemented using Galaxy, an open-source platform for data analysis and workflow creation. The Galaxy @Sciensano instance is available to both internal and external scientists and offers a wide range of tools provided by the community, complemented by over 50 custom tools and pipelines developed in-house. The tool selection is currently focused primarily on the analysis of WGS data generated using Illumina sequencing for microbial pathogen typing, characterization and outbreak detection, but it also addresses specific use cases for other data types. Our Galaxy instance includes several custom-developed 'push-button' pipelines, which are user-friendly and intuitive stand-alone tools that perform complete characterization of bacterial isolates based on WGS data and generate interactive HTML output reports with key findings. These pipelines include quality control, de novo assembly, sequence typing, antimicrobial resistance prediction and several relevant species-specific assays. They are tailored for pathogens with active genomic surveillance programs, and clinical relevance, such as Escherichia coli, Listeria monocytogenes, Salmonella spp. and Mycobacterium tuberculosis. These tools and pipelines utilize internationally recognized databases such as PubMLST, EnteroBase, and the NCBI National Database of Antibiotic Resistant Organisms, which are automatically synchronized on a regular basis to ensure up-to-date results. Many of these pipelines are part of the routine activities of Belgian national reference centers and laboratories, some of which use them under ISO accreditation. This resource is publicly available for noncommercial use at https://galaxy.sciensano.be/and can help other laboratories establish reliable, traceable and reproducible bioinformatics analyses for pathogens encountered in public health settings.},

 abstract = {{\textless}p{\textgreater}Organophosphorus nerve agents (OPNA) are hazardous environmental exposures to the civilian population and have been historically weaponized as chemical warfare agents (CWA). OPNA exposure can lead to several neurological, sensory, and motor symptoms that can manifest into chronic neurological illnesses later in life. There is still a large need for technological advancement to better understand changes in brain function following OPNA exposure. The human-relevant {\textless}italic{\textgreater}in vitro{\textless}/italic{\textgreater} multi-electrode array (MEA) system, which combines the MEA technology with human stem cell technology, has the potential to monitor the acute, sub-chronic, and chronic consequences of OPNA exposure on brain activity. However, the application of this system to assess OPNA hazards and risks to human brain function remains to be investigated. In a concentration-response study, we have employed a human-relevant MEA system to monitor and detect changes in the electrical activity of engineered neural networks to increasing concentrations of the sarin surrogate 4-nitrophenyl isopropyl methylphosphonate (NIMP). We report a biphasic response in the spiking (but not bursting) activity of neurons exposed to low (i.e., 0.4 and 4 μM) versus high concentrations (i.e., 40 and 100 μM) of NIMP, which was monitored during the exposure period and up to 6 days post-exposure. Regardless of the NIMP concentration, at a network level, communication or coordination of neuronal activity decreased as early as 60 min and persisted at 24 h of NIMP exposure. Once NIMP was removed, coordinated activity was no different than control (0 μM of NIMP). Interestingly, only in the high concentration of NIMP did coordination of activity at a network level begin to decrease again at 2 days post-exposure and persisted on day 6 post-exposure. Notably, cell viability was not affected during or after NIMP exposure. Also, while the catalytic activity of AChE decreased during NIMP exposure, its activity recovered once NIMP was removed. Gene expression analysis suggests that human iPSC-derived neurons and primary human astrocytes resulted in altered genes related to the cell’s interaction with the extracellular environment, its intracellular calcium signaling pathways, and inflammation, which could have contributed to how neurons communicated at a network level.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

 abstract = {Recombinantly produced proteins are indispensable tools for medical applications. Since the majority of them are glycoproteins, their N-glycosylation profiles are major determinants for their activity, structural properties and safety. For therapeutical applications, a glycosylation pattern adapted to product and treatment requirements is advantageous. Physcomitrium patens (Physcomitrella, moss) is able to perform highly homogeneous complex-type N-glycosylation. Additionally, it has been glyco-engineered to eliminate plant-specific sugar residues by knock-out of the β1,2-xylosyltransferase and α1,3-fucosyltransferase genes (Δxt/ft). Furthermore, Physcomitrella meets wide-ranging biopharmaceutical requirements such as GMP compliance, product safety, scalability and outstanding possibilities for precise genome engineering. However, all plants, in contrast to mammals, lack the capability to perform N-glycan sialylation. Since sialic acids are a common terminal modification on human N glycans, the property to perform N-glycan sialylation is highly desired within the plant-based biopharmaceutical sector. In this study, we present the successful achievement of protein N-glycan sialylation in stably transformed Physcomitrella. The sialylation ability was achieved in a Δxt/ft moss line by stable expression of seven mammalian coding sequences combined with targeted organelle-specific localization of the encoded enzymes responsible for the generation of β1,4 galactosylated acceptor N glycans as well as the synthesis, activation, transport and transfer of sialic acid. Production of free (Neu5Ac) and activated (CMP-Neu5Ac) sialic acid was proven. The glycosidic anchor for the attachment of terminal sialic acid was generated by the introduction of a chimeric human β1,4 galactosyltransferase gene under the simultaneous knock-out of the gene encoding the endogenous β1,3 galactosyltransferase. Functional complex-type N-glycan sialylation was confirmed via mass spectrometric analysis of a stably co-expressed recombinant human protein.},

In BRAF V600E-mutated malignant melanoma, a frequent mechanism of acquired resistance to BRAF inhibitors involves alternative splicing (AS) of BRAF. The resulting shortened BRAF protein constitutively dimerizes and conveys drug resistance. Here, we have analysed AS in SK-MEL-239 melanoma cells and a BRAF inhibitor (vemurafenib)-resistant derivative that expresses an AS, shortened BRAF V600E transcript. Transcriptome analysis showed differential expression of spliceosome components between the two cell lines. As there is no consensus approach to analysing AS events, we used and compared four common AS softwares based on different principles, DEXSeq, rMATS, ASpli, and LeafCutter. Two of them correctly identified the BRAF V600E AS in the vemurafenib-resistant cells. Only 12 AS events were identified by all four softwares. Testing the AS predictions experimentally showed that these overlapping predictions are highly accurate. Interestingly, they identified AS caused alterations in the expression of melanin synthesis and cell migration genes in the vemurafenib-resistant cells. This analysis shows that combining different AS analysis approaches produces reliable results and meaningful, biologically testable hypotheses.},

To compare MACE to standard RNA-Seq on fresh tissue, four healthy conjunctiva from four subjects were collected during vitreoretinal surgery, halved and immediately transferred to RNA lysis buffer without prior fixation and then processed for either standard RNA-Seq or MACE RNA-Seq analysis. To assess the impact of FFPE preparation on MACE, a third part was fixed in formalin and processed for paraffin embedding, and its transcriptional profile was compared with the unfixed specimens analyzed by MACE. To investigate the impact of FFPE storage time on MACE results, 24 FFPE-treated conjunctival samples from 24 patients were analyzed as well. Nineteen thousand six hundred fifty-nine transcribed genes were detected by both MACE and standard RNA-Seq on fresh tissue, while 3251 and 2213 transcripts were identified explicitly by MACE or RNA-Seq, respectively. Standard RNA-Seq tended to yield longer detected transcripts more often than MACE technology despite normalization, indicating that the MACE technology is less susceptible to a length bias. FFPE processing revealed negligible effects on MACE sequencing results. Several quality-control measurements showed that long-term storage in paraffin did not decrease the diversity of MACE libraries. We noted a nonlinear relation between storage time and the number of raw reads with an accelerated decrease within the first 1000 days in paraffin, while the numbers remained relatively stable in older samples. Interestingly, the number of transcribed genes detected was independent on FFPE storage time. RNA of sufficient quality and quantity can be extracted from FFPE samples to obtain comprehensive transcriptome profiling using MACE technology. We thus present MACE as a novel opportunity for utilizing FFPE samples stored in histological archives.},

In this study we compare its expression profile to conjunctival papilloma (Pap) and healthy conjunctival tissue (Ctrl) and develop a classification tool to differentiate these entities. Seven conjunctival SCC, seven Pap and ten Ctrl were formalin-fixed and paraffin-embedded (FFPE) and analyzed using Massive Analysis of cDNA Ends (MACE) RNA sequencing. Differentially expressed genes (DEG) and gene ontology (GO) clusters were explored and the abundance of involved cell types was quantified by xCell. Finally, a classification model was developed to distinguish SCC from Pap and Ctrl. Among the most prominent DEG in SCC a plethora of keratins were upregulated when compared to Pap and Ctrl. xCell analysis revealed an enrichment of immune cells, including activated dendritic cells and T-helper type 1 cells (Th1), in SCC when compared to Ctrl. The generated classification model could reliably discriminate between the three entities according to the expression pattern of 30 factors. This study provides a transcriptome-wide gene expression profile of rare conjunctival SCC. The analysis identifies distinct keratins, as well as dendritic and Th1 cells as important mediators in SCC. Finally, the provided gene expression classifier may become an aid to the conventional histological classification of conjunctival tumors in uncertain cases.},

In this study, we address molecular and cellular alterations in the vitreous of PDR patients as a means towards assessing the potential contribution of hyalocytes to disease pathogenesis.},

 abstract = {To decipher the transcriptional signature of macrophages of the human vitreous, also known as hyalocytes, and compare it to the profiles of other myeloid cell populations including human blood-derived monocytes, macrophages and brain microglia. This study involves a total of 13 patients of advanced age with disorders of the vitreoretinal interface undergoing vitrectomy at the University Eye Hospital Freiburg between 2018 and 2019. Vitreal hyalocytes were analyzed by fluorescence-activated cell sorting (FACS) and isolated as CD45+CD11b+CX3CR1+Mat-Mac+ cells using a FACS-based sorting protocol. RNA extraction, library preparation and RNA sequencing were performed and the sequencing data was analyzed using the Galaxy web platform. The transcriptome of human hyalocytes was compared to the transcriptional profile of human blood-derived monocytes, macrophages and brain microglia obtained from public databases. Protein validation for selected factors was performed by immunohistochemistry on paraffin sections from three human donor eyes. On average, 383 ± 233 hyalocytes were isolated per patient, resulting in 128 pg/µl ± 76 pg/µl total RNA per sample. RNA sequencing revealed that SPP1, FTL, CD74 and HLA-DRA are among the most abundantly expressed genes in hyalocytes, which was confirmed by immunofluorescence for CD74, FTL and HLA-DRA. Gene ontology (GO) enrichment analysis showed that biological processes such as “humoral immune response”, “leukocyte migration” and “antigen processing and presentation of peptide antigen” (adjusted p \&lt; 0.001) are dominating in vitreal hyalocytes. While the comparison of the gene expression profiles of hyalocytes and other myeloid cell populations showed an overall strong similarity (R2 \&gt; 0.637, p \&lt; 0.001), hyalocytes demonstrated significant differences with respect to common leukocyte-associated factors. In particular, transcripts involved in the immune privilege of the eye, such as POMC, CD46 and CD86, were significantly increased in hyalocytes compared to other myeloid cell subsets. Human hyalocytes represent a unique and distinct innate immune cell population specialized and adapted for the tissue-specific needs in the human vitreous. Vitreal hyalocytes are characterized by a strong expression of genes related to antigen processing and presentation as well as immune modulation. Thus, hyalocytes may represent an underestimated mediator in vitreoretinal disease and for the immune privilege of the eye.},

 abstract = {Rice (Oryza sativa L.) is a vital global crop with a predominant presence in Asia, including Thailand. However, it faces a significant threat from bacterial blight disease, primarily caused by Xanthomonas oryzae pv. oryzae (Xoo). This research aims to provide valuable insights into the genetic virulence factors and genomic variations of Xoo strains isolated in Thailand. Furthermore, we present the first complete genomic database of Thai Xoo, offering a comprehensive resource for studying pathogen diversity, tracking virulence evolution and supporting disease management strategies in rice production. Our phylogenetic analysis unveils that the 20 Thai strains align with the Asian strains, setting them apart from African and US strains. Remarkably, the average nt identity values, in comparison with Xanthomonas oryzae type strain 35933 (XO35933), consistently exceed 99\%. These strains can be classified into three assigned ribosomal sequence types. Our investigation into the pangenome and the phylogenetic relationships of these 20 Xoo genomes reveals a diverse genetic landscape, with the pangenome comprising 11,872 orthologous gene clusters, of which roughly 30\% form the core genome. Notably, all of these genomes exhibit a clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats-Cas I-C array, indicative of their adaptive immune mechanisms. All strains belonged to BXO1 type LPS cassette with high identity. Furthermore, our analysis identifies two distinct types of plasmids, namely, Xanthomonas oryzae pv. oryzicola strain GX01 plasmid pXOCgx01 (A46, A57, A83, A112, D and E) and the X. oryzae strain AH28 plasmid pAH28 (A97). This genomic resource will be valuable for advancing research on surveillance, prevention, management and comparative studies of this critical pathogen in the future.},

Salmon lice have a life cycle consisting of eight life stages. Sex determination by eye is only possible from the sixth stage onwards. A molecular sex determination has not been carried out so far, even though few individual sex-linked SNPs have been reported. In the present study, we used known sex-specific SNPs as a basis to sequence the complete sex-specific gene variants and used the sequence information to develop a sex determination assay. This assay could be used to determine the developmental speed of the two sexes already in the earliest life stages. Additionally, we sampled salmon lice in the nauplius II stage, determined the sex of each individual, pooled their RNA according to their sex, and used RNA sequencing to search for differences in gene expression and further sex-specific SNPs. We succeeded in developing a sex-determination assay that works on DNA or RNA from even the earliest larval stages of the salmon louse after hatching. At these early developmental stages, male salmon lice develop slightly quicker than females. We detected several previously unknown, sex-specific SNPs in our RNA-data seq, but only very few genes showed a differential expression between the sexes. Potential connections between SNPs, gene expression, and development are discussed.},

This work reports the 3.8-Mb genome of Bacillus altitudinis B12, a highly efficient PLA- and keratin-degrading bacterium, with potential for environmental friendly biotechnological applications in the feed, fertilizer, detergent, leather, and pharmaceutical industries. The whole genome sequence of B. altitudinis B12 revealed that this strain (which had been previously misclassified as Bacillus pumilus B12) is closely related to the B. altitudinis strains ER5, W3, and GR-8. A total of 4056 coding sequences were annotated using the RAST server, of which 2484 are core genes of the pan genome of B. altitudinis and 171 are unique to this strain. According to the sequence analysis, B. pumilus B12 has a predicted secretome of 353 proteins, among which a keratinase and a PLA depolymerase were identified by sequence analysis. The presence of these two enzymes could explain the characterized PLA and keratin biodegradation capability of the strain.},

While many metaproteomic workflows are available, the impact of method choice on results remains unclear. Here, we carried out the first community-driven, multi-lab comparison in metaproteomics: the critical assessment of metaproteome investigation study (CAMPI). Based on well-established workflows, we evaluated the effect of sample preparation, mass spectrometry, and bioinformatic analysis using two samples: a simplified, lab-assembled human intestinal model and a human fecal sample. We observed that variability at the peptide level was predominantly due to wet-lab workflows, with a smaller contribution of bioinformatic pipelines. These peptide-level differences largely disappeared at protein group level. While differences were observed for predicted community composition, similar functional profiles were obtained across workflows. CAMPI demonstrates the robustness of present-day metaproteomics research, serves as a template for multi-lab studies in metaproteomics, and provides publicly available data sets for benchmarking future developments.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

Recent studies demonstrated that P. tricornutum can produce functional monoclonal antibodies, such application is currently limited by the production yield that hinders industrialization. Therefore, it is necessary to understand and control the cell biology of P. tricornutum to improve the Biologics production yield. Transcriptomic analyses have recently been used by the pharmaceutical industry to improve the production of Biologics in mammalian cells, especially Biologics titer and cell productivity. Hence, in the present work, we performed a meta-analysis of seven publicly available RNA-Seq datasets from different strains of P. tricornutum, for which the culture conditions were chosen as similar as possible. We analyzed the differential expression of genes that are involved in biological processes that are well known to potentially impact the bioproduction and critical quality attributes of Biologics. Therefore, the expression of genes involved in the N-glycan biosynthesis, protein export and secretion, protein quality control and proteasome, as well as those encoding proteases were analyzed and compared. The results pave the way towards optimizing Biologics production in P. tricornutum and highlight that the Pt4, Pt3 Ov and Pt8 strains seem to be the most promising P. tricornutum strains.},

Conditional knockout of Dot1l in mouse cerebellar granule cells (Dot1l-cKOAtoh1) led to a smaller external granular layer with fewer precursors of granule neurons. Dot1l-cKOAtoh1 mice had impaired proliferation and differentiation of granular progenitors, which resulted in a smaller cerebellum. Mutant mice showed mild ataxia in motor behavior tests. In contrast, Purkinje cell-specific conditional knockout mice showed no obvious phenotype. Genome-wide transcription analysis of Dot1l-cKOAtoh1 cerebella using microarrays revealed changes in genes that function in cell cycle, cell migration, axon guidance, and metabolism. To identify direct DOT1L target genes, we used genome-wide profiling of H3K79me2 and transcriptional analysis. Analysis of differentially methylated regions (DR) and differentially expressed genes (DE) revealed in total 12 putative DOT1L target genes in Dot1l-cKOAtoh1 affecting signaling (Tnfaip8l3, B3galt5), transcription (Otx1), cell migration and axon guidance (Sema4a, Sema5a, Robo1), cholesterol and lipid metabolism (Lss, Cyp51), cell cycle (Cdkn1a), calcium-dependent cell-adhesion or exocytosis (Pcdh17, Cadps2), and unknown function (Fam174b).

Additionally, epigenetic chromatin modifications, like histone methylation, have an important role for establishing and maintaining specific cell fates within this process. The vast majority of histone methylation occurs on the flexible histone tail, which is accessible to histone modifiers, erasers, and histone reader proteins. In contrast, H3K79 methylation is located in the globular domain of histone 3 and is implicated in different developmental functions. H3K79 methylation is evolutionarily conserved and can be found in a wide range of species from Homo sapiens to Saccharomyces cerevisiae. The modification occurs in different cell populations within organisms, including neural progenitors. The location of H3K79 methylation in the globular domain of histone 3 makes it difficult to assess.

Gain and loss of FOXI1 function are associated with human diseases, including Pendred syndrome, male infertility, renal acidosis, and cancers. Foxi1 was predominantly studied in the context of ISC specification, however, reports indicate additional functions in early and ectodermal development. Here, we re-investigated the functions of Foxi1 in Xenopus laevis embryonic mucociliary epidermis developpment and found a novel function for Foxi1 in the generation of Notch-ligand expressing mucociliary multipotent progenitors (MPPs). We demonstrate that MPPs are a distinct sub-population of epidermal cells in which Foxi1 has two concentration-dependent functions: At low levels, Foxi1 maintains ectodermal competence in MPPs through transcriptional and epigenetic mechanisms, while at high levels, Foxi1 induces a multi-step process of ISC specification and differentiation in cooperation with Ubp1 and Dmrt2. We further describe how foxi1 expression is affected through auto- and Notch-regulation, and how this developmental program affects mucociliary patterning. Together, we reveal novel functions for MPPs and Foxi1 in Xenopus mucociliary epidermis formation, relevant to our understanding of vertebrate development and human disease.},

 abstract = {The type VIIb protein secretion system (T7SSb) is found in Bacillota (firmicute) bacteria and has been shown to mediate interbacterial competition. EssC is a membrane-bound ATPase that is a critical component of the T7SSb and plays a key role in substrate recognition. Prior analysis of available genome sequences of the foodborne bacterial pathogen Listeria monocytogenes has shown that although the T7SSb was encoded as part of the core genome, EssC could be found as one of seven different sequence variants. While each sequence variant was associated with a specific suite of candidate substrate proteins encoded immediately downstream of essC, many LXG-domain proteins were encoded across multiple essC sequence variants. Here, we have extended this analysis using a diverse collection of 37 930 L . monocytogenes genomes. We have identified a rare eighth variant of EssC present in ten L. monocytogenes lineage III genomes. These genomes also encode a large toxin of the rearrangement hotspot (Rhs) repeat family adjacent to essC8, along with a probable immunity protein and three small accessory proteins.

@article{bowran_novel_2023,
 abstract = {{\textless}h4{\textgreater}ABSTRACT{\textless}/h4{\textgreater} The Type VIIb protein secretion system (T7SSb) is found in Bacillota (firmicute) bacteria and has been shown to mediate interbacterial competition. EssC is a membrane-bound ATPase that is a critical component of the T7SSb and plays a key role in substrate recognition. Prior analysis of available genome sequences of the foodborne bacterial pathogen Listeria monocytogenes has shown that although the T7SSb was encoded as part of the core genome, EssC could be found as one of seven different sequence variants. While each sequence variant was associated with a specific suite of candidate substrate proteins encoded immediately downstream of essC , many LXG-domain proteins were encoded across multiple essC sequence variants. Here we have extended this analysis using a diverse collection of 37,930 L. monocytogenes genomes. We have identified a rare eighth variant of EssC present in ten L. monocytogenes Lineage III genomes. These genomes also encode a large toxin of the rearrangement hotspot (Rhs) repeat family adjacent to essC8 , along with a probable immunity protein and three small accessory proteins. We have further identified nine novel LXG-domain proteins, and four additional chromosomal hotspots across L. monocytogenes genomes where LXG proteins can be encoded. The eight L. monocytogenes EssC variants were also found in other Listeria species, with additional novel EssC types also identified. Across the genus, species frequently encoded multiple EssC types, indicating that T7SSb diversity is a primary feature of the genus Listeria . {\textless}h4{\textgreater}DATA SUMMARY{\textless}/h4{\textgreater} All genome sequences used in this study are available via Genbank, and the assembly accession numbers are provided in Table S1. This file also lists relevant metadata (name, source category, country, year and clonal complex). {\textless}h4{\textgreater}IMPACT STATEMENT{\textless}/h4{\textgreater} Listeria monocytogenes is a soil-borne saprophytic bacterium and a food-borne pathogen of humans. Decomposing plant matter and the human GI tract are rich in diverse microbial species and to colonise these niches L. monocytogenes must be able to compete with other bacteria. The type VII secretion system (T7SS) of Bacillota has been shown to secrete protein toxins that target other bacteria. In this study we have analysed a diverse collection of L. monocytogenes genome sequences to study the diversity of the Listeria T7SS and its putative effector proteins. We show that the EssC component of the L. monocytogenes T7SS is highly diverse, clustering into one of eight sequence variants. Each EssC variant is associated with a specific toxin candidate, and the EssC8 variant T7SS likely secretes a novel rearrangement hotspot (Rhs) repeat toxin. We also identify multiple new LXG-families of T7SS toxins and describe genomic hotspots where they are encoded. We find no link between EssC variants and clinical outcome. In agreement with this, analysis of EssC variability in available genomes of other Listeria species showed that all eight L. monocytogenes EssC variants are present in non-monocytogenes Listeria species.},

We use up-to-date models of the gravitational wave power spectra to compare constraints on the parameters of the phase transition for the three different available PTA measurements and to work out a refined estimate of the cosmological magnetic field that should result from this transition. We find that the PTA data, combined with a constraint from the abundance of primordial black holes, are consistent with a possibility of a moderate strength first-order phase transition during quark confinement and yield a rather precise prediction for the initial parameters of the magnetic field, with the magnetic field energy density in near equipartition with photon energy density and correlation length close to one co-moving parsec.},

 abstract = {Cyanobacteria are highly promising microorganisms in forthcoming biotechnologies. Besides the systematic development of molecular tools for genetic engineering, the design of chassis strains and novel reactor concepts are in focus. The latter includes capillary biofilm reactors (CBR), which offer a high surface area-to-volume ratio and very high cell densities. In this context, Tolypothrix sp. PCC 7712 was found to be highly suited for this reactor system due to maximal surface coverage, extraordinarily strong biofilm attachment, and high biomass formation. Here, we provide the genome sequence of Tolypothrix sp. PCC 7712 to potentially allow targeted strain engineering. Surprisingly, it was almost identical to an available incomplete genome draft of Tolypothrix sp. PCC 7601. Thus, we completely sequenced this strain as well and compared it in detail to strain PCC 7712. Comparative genome analysis revealed 257 and 80 unique protein-coding sequences for strains PCC 7601 and PCC 7712, respectively. Clustering genomes based on average nucleotide identity (ANI) and 16S rRNA homology showed 99.98\% similarity and only minor distance, respectively, between the two strains in contrast to 21 other cyanobacterial genomes. Despite these high similarities, both strains differ in the ability to fix atmospheric nitrogen and show specific sequence variations, which are discussed in the paper.},

 abstract = {Objectives
This study reports the genomic characterization of the multidrug resistant Salmonella Newport strain 195\_20 recovered from the diarrheic faeces of a foal in Brazil and co-harbouring the mcr-9, blaCMY-2 and qnrB19 antibiotic resistance genes.
Methods
Bacterial isolate positive for mobile colistin resistance gene (mcr-9) was submitted to antimicrobial susceptibility testing by disk diffusion and broth microdilution for colistin and polymyxin B. The isolate was submitted to whole genome sequencing by Illumina technology and Nanopore Sequencing. Conjugation assays, plasmid sizes determined by S1-PFGE and plasmid content were investigated by hybrid assembly after MinIon long reads sequencing.
Results
Isolate 195\_20 was identified as sequence type ST45, resistant to penicillin and cephalosporins (ampicillin, ceftazidime, ceftriaxone and cefotaxime), aminoglycosides (streptomycin and gentamicin), phenicol (chloramphenicol), quinolones and fluoroquinolones (nalidixic acid, ciprofloxacin, and pefloxacin), folate pathway antagonists (sulfonamides and trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole), and tetracycline. A transferable IncHI2/IncHI2A plasmid sized ca. 262kb was found to carry the mcr-9 gene in a module consisting of IS903-mcr-9-wbuC-IS26. In addition, an 174kb IncC and a 48kb IncN plasmid were also identified in the 195\_20 isolate, carrying blaCMY-2 and qnrB19, respectively.
Conclusions
Not surprisingly, isolate 195\_20 was susceptible to polymyxins, possibly due to absence of qseBC regulatory operon. Presence of mobile colistin resistance (mcr-9), third-generation cephalosporins (blaCMY-2) and quinolone (qnrB19) resistance determinants in zoonotic pathogens from animals in close contact with humans alerts for the possible route of transmission between these different reservoirs.},

 abstract = {Harmful algal blooms plague bodies of freshwater globally. These blooms are often composed of outgrowths of cyanobacteria capable of producing the heptapeptide Microcystin-LR (MC-LR) which is a well-known hepatotoxin. Recently, MC-LR has been detected in aerosols generated from lake water. However, the risk for human health effects due to MC-LR inhalation exposure have not been extensively investigated. In this study, we exposed a fully differentiated 3D human airway epithelium derived from 14 healthy donors to MC-LR-containing aerosol once a day for 3 days. Concentrations of MC-LR ranged from 100 pM to 1 µM. Although there were little to no detrimental alterations in measures of the airway epithelial function (i.e. cell survival, tissue integrity, mucociliary clearance, or cilia beating frequency), a distinct shift in the transcriptional activity was found. Genes related to inflammation were found to be upregulated such as C-C motif chemokine 5 (CCL5; log2FC = 0.57, p = 0.03) and C-C chemokine receptor type 7 (CCR7; log2FC = 0.84, p = 0.03). Functionally, conditioned media from MC-LR exposed airway epithelium was also found to have significant chemo-attractive properties for primary human neutrophils. Additionally, increases were found in the concentration of secreted chemokine proteins in the conditioned media such as CCL1 (log2FC = 5.07, p = 0.0001) and CCL5 (log2FC = 1.02, p = 0.046). These results suggest that MC-LR exposure to the human airway epithelium is capable of inducing an inflammatory response that may potentiate acute or chronic disease.},

 abstract = {Microcystin-LR (MC-LR) is one of a large family of cyanotoxins which are naturally produced by cyanobacteria within harmful algal blooms occurring in bodies of water globally. Early findings of the toxicity of such blooms stemmed from fatalities of livestock drinking from affected water. Since then, various toxins have been identified such as the microcystins. Microcystin-LR has been studied as a representative congener due to its abundance and toxicity. While there have been extensive studies of microcystin-LR by oral route exposure, we have turned our attention to inhalation route exposure due to the recent findings of microcystin-containing lake and sea-spray aerosol. We have shown inflammatory outcomes in the airways of mice and in human cell culture models after microcystin aerosol exposure, and have found a consistent molecular patterns similar to those of Type 1/Type 17 driven neutrophilic asthma. Here we address the hypothesis that MC-LR will increase the inflammatory mediators of neutrophilic asthma leading to worsening symptoms. This is tested and characterized in both in vitro and in vivo models. We found that asthma symptoms and molecular signatures of inflammation are both worsened by MC-LR exposure in a mouse model of neutrophilic asthma. We found that 3D human airway cell culture models reconstructed from asthmatic donor cells are similarly affected, however healthy donor cells are nearly unaltered by comparison. Aggregating these findings with RNA sequencing data from all models, we developed a hypothetical molecular mechanism which relies on MC-LR mediated amplification of existing inflammatory signaling. We test this in a human reporter cell line of NF-κB activity and further demonstrate the mechanism by inhibitor testing. This study sheds light on the risk to asthmatic patients living near or recreating on affected bodies of water. Beyond asthma, we believe this study provides crucial insight into the findings over the last 40 years concerning disparate outcomes of MC-LR exposure as the result of exposure will be dependent on the signaling state of the tissue upon exposure.},

Precision medicine approaches offer hope, and ex vivo drug response profiling of patient-derived tumor cells emerges as a promising tool to identify effective therapies for individual patients. Here, we establish ex vivo culture conditions to propagate Ewing sarcoma and CIC::DUX4 sarcoma as tumoroids. These models retain their original molecular and functional characteristics, including recurrent ARID1A mutations in CIC::DUX4 sarcoma, and serve as tumor avatars for large-scale drug testing. Screening a large drug library on a small living biobank of such tumors not only reveals distinct differences in drug response between the two entities, but also identifies a dependency of CIC::DUX4 sarcoma cells on MCL1. Mechanistically, MCL1 is identified as a direct transcriptional target of the CIC::DUX4 fusion oncogene. Genetic and pharmacological inhibition of MCL1 induces rapid apoptosis in CIC::DUX4 sarcoma cells and inhibits tumor growth in a xenograft model. Thus, MCL1 represents a potential therapeutic target for CIC::DUX4 sarcoma. Overall, our study highlights the feasibility of drug response profiling for individual sarcoma cases and suggests that further clinical assessments of its benefit are warranted.},

Using single-cell transcriptomics, chromatin accessibility profiling, lineage tracing, birthdating, transplantation across developmental stages and perturbation sequencing in mouse embryos, we investigated how progenitor competence influences the maturation and differentiation of these neurons. We found that the temporal progression of neurogenesis shapes maturation competence in ganglionic eminence progenitors, influencing how their progeny progress toward mature states. By contrast, differentiation competence—defined as the ability of progenitors to produce diverse transcriptomic identities—was maintained throughout neurogenesis. Chromatin remodeling, together with a regulatory module composed of the transcription factor NFIB and its target genes, influenced maturation competence in late-born neurons. These findings reveal how transcriptional programs and chromatin accessibility govern neuronal maturation and the diversification of GABAergic neuron subtypes during neurodevelopment.},

In \textit{D. discoideum}, oscillatory cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP) signaling drives collective behavior and induces a temporal developmental gene expression program. How collective cAMP oscillations emerge or how they encode temporal transcriptional information is still poorly understood. To address this, we identified a transcription factor required for the initiation of collective behavior. Hbx5 activity is cAMP dependent and provides a sensitive single-cell readout for cAMP signaling. Extensive stochastic pulsatile cAMP signaling is found to precede collective oscillations. Stochastic signaling induces Hbx5-dependent transcriptional feedback, which enhances signal sensitivity and cell-cell coupling. This results in the emergence of synchronized collective oscillations, which subsequently activates the GtaC transcription factor and triggers shifts in developmental gene expression. Our results suggest this temporal coordination is encoded by changes in the amplitude of cAMP oscillations and differential sensitivity of these transcription factors to the cAMP-regulated kinase ErkB.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

 abstract = {Cardiomyopathy is one of the major causes of heart failure that affects approximately 26 million patients worldwide. In a healthy situation, the heart depends on fatty acid oxidation (FAO) to maintain its energy demand. In failing hearts, the heart reverts to a fetal-like metabolic state in which FAO is downregulated and the heart switches to glucose metabolism. Peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor alpha (PPARA), a regulator of FAO, has recently been found to be hypoacetylated and its downstream effectors downregulated in dilated cardiomyopathy. However, the exact mechanisms remain largely unknown. The main purpose of this internship was to identify the specific FAO expression patterns in a large heterogenic patient cohort and investigate the involvement of PPARA regulation. The secondary goal was to set up a transcriptomic pipeline within Galaxy, a user-friendly bioinformatics platform, and test whether this platform can be used in diagnostics in the future. Differential expression analysis and gene enrichment of RNA-sequencing data show a type-specific FAO expression pattern of DCM and LVH versus HCM and confirm a downregulation of FAO related processes. Public RNA-sequencing data after the use of a bezafibrate, a PPARA agonist, which has been integrated, shows the upregulation of genes that are downregulated in our data. Combined, the results confirm the downregulation of FAO, but indicate a disease-type-specific FAO expression pattern. The results from the Galaxy pipeline show that this pipeline is suitable for transcriptomic analyses. Furthermore, we highlight the potential therapeutic role of bezafibrate in cardiomyopathy.},

 abstract = {Chromatin properties are regulated by complex networks of epigenome modifications. Currently, it is unclear how these modifications interact and if they control downstream effects such as gene expression. We employed promiscuous chromatin binding of a zinc finger fused catalytic domain of DNMT3A to introduce DNA methylation in HEK293 cells at many CpG islands (CGIs) and systematically investigated the dynamics of the introduced DNA methylation and the consequent changes of the epigenome network. We observed efficient methylation at thousands of CGIs, but it was unstable at about 90\% of them, highlighting the power of genome-wide molecular processes that protect CGIs against DNA methylation. Partially stable methylation was observed at about 1000 CGIs, which showed enrichment in H3K27me3. Globally, the introduced DNA methylation strongly correlated with a decrease in gene expression indicating a direct effect. Similarly, global but transient reductions in H3K4me3 and H3K27ac were observed after DNA methylation but no changes were found for H3K9me3 and H3K36me3. Our data provide a global and time-resolved view on the network of epigenome modifications, their connections with DNA methylation and the responses triggered by artificial DNA methylation revealing a direct repressive effect of DNA methylation in CGIs on H3K4me3, histone acetylation, and gene expression.},

 abstract = {While cytosine-C5 methylation of DNA is an essential regulatory system in higher eukaryotes, the presence and relevance of 6-methyladenine (m6dA) in human cells is controversial. To study the role of m6dA in human DNA, we introduced it in human cells at a genome-wide scale at GANTC and GATC sites by expression of bacterial DNA methyltransferases and observed concomitant reductions in cell viability, in particular after global GANTC methylation. We identified several genes that are directly regulated by m6dA in a GANTC context. Upregulated genes showed m6dA-dependent reduction of H3K27me3 suggesting that the PRC2 complex is inhibited by m6dA. Genes downregulated by m6dA showed enrichment of JUN family transcription factor binding sites. JUN binds m6dA containing DNA with reduced affinity suggesting that m6dA can reduce the recruitment of JUN transcription factors to target genes. Our study documents that global introduction of m6dA in human DNA has physiological effects. Furthermore, we identified a set of target genes which are directly regulated by m6dA in human cells, and we defined two molecular pathways with opposing effects by which artificially introduced m6dA in GANTC motifs can directly control gene expression and phenotypes of human cells.},

MEFV, which encodes the inflammasome sensor pyrin, is mutated in two autoinflammatory diseases, familial Mediterranean fever (FMF) and pyrin-associated autoinflammation with neutrophilic dermatosis (PAAND). Here, we developed SpeckSeq, a method that combines DNA bar-coding, ASC speck–based single-cell sorting and next-generation sequencing to systematically identify hypermorphic MEFV variants in response to different stimuli. SpeckSeq identified 49 GoF mutations separated into two distinct groups containing either PAAND variants or FMF variants. SpeckSeq was validated using patients’ cells and supported a reclassification of MEFV variant pathogenicity, leading to novel diagnoses. As a large-scale mutagenesis approach, using human genetics as a guide, SpeckSeq revealed structural and functional pyrin features, including a putative ligand-accommodating cavity in the B30.2 domain. Altogether, SpeckSeq classifies VUS to refine molecular diagnostics and improve our knowledge on the pyrin inflammasome.},

It has a high potential for basic research and biotechnological applications, e.g., it can be used for the cell-free production of (labeled) heterologous proteins, for synthetic biological applications, and for the production of various compounds. However, the ploidy level in V. natriegens remains unknown. At nine time points throughout the growth curve, we analyzed the numbers of origins and termini of both chromosomes with qPCR and the relative abundances of all genomic sites with marker frequency analyses. During the lag phase until early exponential growth, the origin copy number and origin/terminus ratio of chromosome 1 increased severalfold, but the increase was lower for chromosome 2. This increase was paralleled by an increase in cell volume. During the exponential phase, the origin/terminus ratio and cell volume decreased again. This highly dynamic and fast regulation has not yet been described for any other species. In this study, the gene dosage increase in origin-adjacent genes during the lag phase is discussed together with the nonrandom distribution of genes on the chromosomes of V. natriegens. Taken together, the results of this study provide the first comprehensive overview of the chromosome dynamics in V. natriegens and will guide the optimization of molecular biological characterization and biotechnological applications.},

 abstract = {The salmon louse, Lepeophtheirus salmonis, is an ectoparasitic crustacean that annually inflicts substantial losses to the aquaculture industry in the northern hemisphere and poses a threat to the wild populations of salmonids. The salmon louse life cycle consists of eight developmental stages each separated by a molt. Fushi Tarazu Factor-1 (FTZ-F1) is an ecdysteroid-regulated gene that encodes a member of the NR5A family of nuclear receptors that is shown to play a crucial regulatory role in molting in insects and nematodes. Characterization of an FTZ-F1 orthologue in the salmon louse gave two isoforms named αFTZ-F1 and βFTZ-F1, which are identical except for the presence of a unique N-terminal domain (A/B domain). A comparison suggest conservation of the FTZ-F1 gene structure among ecdysozoans, with the exception of nematodes, to produce isoforms with unique N-terminal domains through alternative transcription start and splicing. The two isoforms of the salmon louse FTZ-F1 were expressed in different amounts in the same tissues and showed a distinct cyclical expression pattern through the molting cycle with βFTZ-F1 being the highest expressed isoform. While RNA interference knockdown of βFTZ-F1 in nauplius larvae and in pre-adult males lead to molting arrest, knockdown of βFTZ-F1 in pre-adult II female lice caused disruption of oocyte maturation at the vitellogenic stage. No apparent phenotype could be observed in αFTZ-F1 knockdown larvae, or in their development to adults, and no genes were found to be differentially expressed in the nauplii larvae following αFTZ-F1 knockdown. βFTZ-F1 knockdown in nauplii larvae caused both down and upregulation of genes associated with proteolysis and chitin binding and affected a large number of genes which are in normal salmon louse development expressed in a cyclical pattern. This is the first description of FTZ-F1 gene function in copepod crustaceans and provides a foundation to expand the understanding of the molecular mechanisms of molting in the salmon louse and other copepods.},

 abstract = {Genome annotation is central to today's proteomic research as it draws the outlines of the proteomic landscape. Traditional models of open reading frame (ORF) annotation impose two arbitrary criteria: a minimum length of 100 codons and a single ORF per transcript. However, a growing number of studies report expression of proteins from allegedly non-coding regions, challenging the accuracy of current genome annotations. These novel proteins were found encoded either within non-coding RNAs, 5' or 3' untranslated regions (UTRs) of mRNAs, or overlapping a known coding sequence (CDS) in an alternative ORF. OpenProt is the first database that enforces a polycistronic model for eukaryotic genomes, allowing annotation of multiple ORFs per transcript. OpenProt is freely accessible and offers custom downloads of protein sequences across 10 species. Using OpenProt database for proteomic experiments enables novel proteins discovery and highlights the polycistronic nature of eukaryotic genes. The size of OpenProt database (all predicted proteins) is substantial and need be taken in account for the analysis. However, with appropriate false discovery rate (FDR) settings or the use of a restricted OpenProt database, users will gain a more realistic view of the proteomic landscape. Overall, OpenProt is a freely available tool that will foster proteomic discoveries.},

Although there are already several vaccines licensed, as novel variants develop, understanding the immune response induced by vaccination and natural infection is key for the development of future vaccines. \textbf{Methods}: In this study, we have used flow cytometry and next-generation sequencing to assess the longitudinal CD8$^{\textrm{+}}$ T-cell response against natural infection and vaccination in convalescent and vaccinated individuals, from early activation to immune memory establishment. Moreover, we have characterized the T-cell receptor clonality and diversity at different stages post-infection and post-vaccination. \textbf{Results}: We have found no significant differences in CD8$^{\textrm{+}}$ T-cell activation during the first three weeks post-infection compared to the first three weeks after first vaccination. Conversely, natural infection resulted in sustained high levels of T-cell activation at four weeks post-infection, a point in which we observed a decline in T-cell activation post-vaccination despite boosting with a second vaccination shot. Moreover, additional vaccination did not result in enhanced T-cell activation. Of note, we have observed variations in the memory subset structure at every stage of disease and vaccination. Overall, both infection and immunization induced a highly diverse T-cell receptor repertoire, which was observed both between study groups and between patients inside a given group. \textbf{Conclusions}: These data contribute to expand our knowledge about the immune response to SARS-CoV-2 infection and vaccination and call for additional strategies to enhance T-cell responses by booster immunization.},

Here, we report that phosphorylation of the pivotal pathway protein FANCD2 by CHK1 triggers its FBXL12-dependent proteasomal degradation, facilitating FANCD2 clearance at stalled replication forks. This promotes efficient DNA replication under conditions of CYCLIN E- and drug-induced replication stress. Reconstituting FANCD2-deficient fibroblasts with phosphodegron mutants failed to re-establish fork progression. In the absence of FBXL12, FANCD2 becomes trapped on chromatin, leading to replication stress and excessive DNA damage. In human cancers, FBXL12, CYCLIN E, and FA signaling are positively correlated, and FBXL12 upregulation is linked to reduced survival in patients with high CYCLIN E-expressing breast tumors. Finally, depletion of FBXL12 exacerbated oncogene-induced replication stress and sensitized cancer cells to drug-induced replication stress by WEE1 inhibition. Collectively, our results indicate that FBXL12 constitutes a vulnerability and a potential therapeutic target in CYCLIN E-overexpressing cancers.},

Moreover, this first wave of transcription results in RNAPII blockages behind the replication fork, leading to changes in alternative splicing.

In the present study, we comprehensively investigated how the three PIMs simultaneously alter transcriptional gene regulation during early human Th17 cell differentiation.

Further, PIMs modulate Th cell signaling, potentially via STAT1 and STAT3. Overall, our study highlights the inhibitory role of PIMs in human Th17 cell differentiation, thereby suggesting their association with autoimmune phenotypes.},

Phylogenetic analyses (full-­length 16S rRNA gene and whole-­genome sequence) revealed the strain to belong to the genus Prevotella, but to be distant from recognized species, with the closest relationship to Prevotella veroralis. Unambiguous identification also proved possible by MALDI-­TOF MS. The genomic DNA G+C content was 41.5 mol\%. Strain A2879T was moderately saccharolytic and proteolytic. The most abundant cellular long-­chain fatty acids were anteiso-C­ 15 : 0 and iso-C­ 15 : 0. In view of these data, strain A2879T is considered to represent a novel species within the genus Prevotella, for which the name Prevotella vespertina sp. nov. is proposed.

 abstract = {To date, Certrevirus is one of two genera of bacteriophage (phage), with phages infecting Pectobacterium atrosepticum, an economically important phytopathogen that causes potato blackleg and soft rot disease. This study provides a detailed description of Pectobacterium phage CB7 (vB\_PatM\_CB7), which specifically infects P. atrosepticum. Host range, morphology, latent period, burst size and stability at different conditions of temperature and pH were examined. Analysis of its genome (142.8 kbp) shows that the phage forms a new species of Certrevirus, sharing sequence similarity with other members, highlighting conservation within the genus. Conserved elements include a putative early promoter like that of the Escherichia coli sigma70 promoter, which was found to be shared with other genus members. A number of dissimilarities were observed, relating to DNA methylation and nucleotide metabolism. Some members do not have homologues of a cytosine methylase and anaerobic nucleotide reductase subunits NrdD and NrdG, respectively. Furthermore, the genome of CB7 contains one of the largest numbers of homing endonucleases described in a single phage genome in the literature to date, with a total of 23 belonging to the HNH and LAGLIDADG families. Analysis by RT-PCR of the HNH homing endonuclease residing within introns of genes for the large terminase, DNA polymerase, ribonucleotide reductase subunits NrdA and NrdB show that they are splicing competent. Electrospray ionization-tandem mass spectrometry (ESI-MS/MS) was also performed on the virion of CB7, allowing the identification of 26 structural proteins\&mdash;20 of which were found to be shared with the type phages of the genera of Vequintavirus and Seunavirus. The results of this study provide greater insights into the phages of the Certrevirus genus as well as the subfamily Vequintavirinae.},

Therefore, evaluation of novel antimicrobial drugs is needed to identify potential treatments with better outcomes. We evaluated the in vitro activity of novel antimicrobial drugs/combinations against 97 KPC-producing Klebsiella pneumoniae isolates recovered from different hospitals in Brazil during 2021–2022. Clonality, resistance and virulence genes were detected by whole-genome sequencing. The majority of the isolates (54.6\%) were classified as extensively drug resistant or multidrug resistant (44.3\%); one isolate showed a pandrug resistance phenotype. The most active antimicrobial agents were meropenem-vaborbactam, cefiderocol, and ceftazidime-avibactam, with sensitivities higher than 90\%; resistance to ceftazidime-avibactam was associated with KPC-33 or KPC-44 variants. Colistin and polymyxin B were active against 58.6\% of the isolates. The 97 isolates were distributed into 17 different sequence types, with a predominance of ST11 (37.4\%). Although high in vitro susceptibility rates were detected for meropenem-vaborbactam and cefiderocol, only ceftazidime-avibactam is currently available in Brazil. Our findings showed limited susceptibility to antimicrobial drugs employed for infection treatment of carbapenem-resistant K. pneumoniae, underscoring the urgent need for stringent policies for antimicrobial stewardship to preserve the activity of such drugs.},

 abstract = {Pseudomonas aeruginosa, an opportunistic pathogen causing infections in immunocompromised patients, usually shows pronounced antimicrobial resistance. In recent years, the frequency of carbapenemases in P. aeruginosa has decreased, which allows use of new beta-lactams/combinations in antimicrobial therapy. Therefore, the in vitro evaluation of these drugs in contemporary isolates is warranted. We evaluated the antimicrobial susceptibility and genomic aspects of 119 clinical P. aeruginosa isolates from 24 different hospitals in Brazil in 2021–2022. Identification was performed via MALDI-TOF-MS, and antimicrobial susceptibility was identified through broth microdilution, gradient tests, or disk diffusion. Whole-genome sequencing was carried out using NextSeq equipment. The most active drug was cefiderocol (100\%), followed by ceftazidime–avibactam (94.1\%), ceftolozane–tazobactam (92.4\%), and imipenem–relebactam (81.5\%). Imipenem susceptibility was detected in 59 isolates (49.6\%), and the most active aminoglycoside was tobramycin, to which 99 (83.2\%) isolates were susceptible. Seventy-one different sequence types (STs) were detected, including twelve new STs described herein. The acquired resistance genes blaCTX-M-2 and blaKPC-2 were identified in ten (8.4\%) and two (1.7\%) isolates, respectively. Several virulence genes (exoSTUY, toxA, aprA, lasA/B, plcH) were also identified. We found that new antimicrobials are effective against the diverse P. aeruginosa population that has been circulating in Brazilian hospitals in recent years.},

 abstract = {Neuroblastoma (NB) is the most frequent extracranial solid tumour in childhood. The clinical diagnosis of NB is difficult due to the age of the patient and the vague appearance of the symptoms. Moreover, there are two groups of aggressive NBs, one with MYCN amplification and the other with an 11q deletion. Some genes could be a candidate suppressor for NB, e.g., the DLG2 gene that resides within the 11q-deleted region. The DLG2 gene has a large number of exons and multiple isoforms depending on the alternative splicing process. Moreover, these isoforms can include the L27 domain or not. This study aimed to analyse, by applying bioinformatic tools, if isoform 2, which does not have L27 domain, could be a candidate suppressor for this disease. RNA-seq samples from different human cell lines were collected from NCBI and a quality analysis was performed. The filtered samples were run in R and Python programs to do a visualization of the exon expression level and the prediction of Rsubread for exon-exon junctions. The results showed that isoform 2 of DLG2 gene was not expressed in the samples of NB, which is a promising result for being a candidate suppressor of NB. Furthermore, the prediction of exon-exon junctions by Rsubread was confirmed to be very accurate. In conclusion, this study shows that isoform 2 of DLG2 gene could be a candidate tumour suppressor in NB that could, in the future, be used as a target to help to detect earlier the presence of NB and increase the life expectancy of children who suffer from this disease.},

 abstract = {β-glucuronidases (GUS) of intestinal bacteria remove glucuronic acid from glucoronides, reversing phase II metabolism of the liver and affecting the level of active deconjugated metabolites deriving from drugs or xenobiotics. Two hundred seventy-nine non-redundant GUS sequences are known in the gut microbiota, classified in seven structural categories (NL, L1, L2, mL1, mL2, mL1,2, and NC) with different biocatalytic properties. In the present study, the intestinal metagenome of 60 healthy subjects from five geographically different cohorts was assembled, binned, and mined to determine qualitative and quantitative differences in GUS profile, potentially affecting response to drugs and xenobiotics. Each metagenome harbored 4-70 different GUS, altogether accounting for 218. The amount of intestinal bacteria with at least one GUS gene was highly variable, from 0.7 to 82.2\%, 25.7\% on average. No significant difference among cohorts could be identified, except for the Ethiopia (ETH) cohort where GUS-encoding bacteria were significantly less abundant. The structural categories were differently distributed among the metagenomes, but without any statistical significance related to the cohorts. GUS profiles were generally dominated by the category NL, followed by mL1, L2, and L1. The GUS categories most involved in the hydrolysis of small molecules, including drugs, are L1 and mL1. Bacteria contributing to these categories belonged to \textit{Bacteroides ovatus}, \textit{Bacteroides dorei}, \textit{Bacteroides fragilis}, \textit{Escherichia coli}, \textit{Eubacterium eligens}, \textit{Faecalibacterium prausnitzii}, \textit{Parabacteroides merdae}, and \textit{Ruminococcus gnavus}. Bacteria harboring L1 GUS were generally scarcely abundant ({\textless}1.3\%), except in three metagenomes, where they reached up to 24.3\% for the contribution of \textit{E. coli} and \textit{F. prausnitzii.} Bacteria harboring mL1 GUS were significantly more abundant (mean = 4.6\%), with \textit{Bacteroides} representing a major contributor. Albeit mL1 enzymes are less active than L1 ones, \textit{Bacteroides} likely plays a pivotal role in the deglucuronidation, due to its remarkable abundance in the microbiomes. The observed broad interindividual heterogeneity of GUS profiles, particularly of the L1 and mL1 categories, likely represent a major driver of pharmacomicrobiomics variability, affecting drug response and toxicity. Different geographical origins, genetic, nutritional, and lifestyle features of the hosts seemed not to be relevant in the definition of glucuronidase activity, albeit they influenced the richness of the GUS profile.},

Recently, studies have demonstrated the capacity of \textit{Komagataeibacter} spp. in the biotransformation of inhibitors found in lignocellulosic hydrolysates, aromatic lignin-derived monomers (LDMs) and acetate. In general, detoxification and BC synthesis from lignocellulosic inhibitors requires a carbon flow from acetyl-coA towards tricarboxylic acid and gluconeogenesis, respectively. However, the related molecular aspects have not yet been identified in \textit{Komagataeibacter} spp. In this study, we isolated a cellulose-producing bacterium capable of synthesizing BC in a minimal medium containing crude glycerol, a by-product from the biodiesel production process. The isolate, affiliated to \textit{Komagataeibacter} genus, synthesized cellulose in a minimal medium containing glucose (3.3 ± 0.3 g/L), pure glycerol (2.2 ± 0.1 g/L) and crude glycerol (2.1 ± 0.1 g/L). Genome assembly and annotation identified four copies of bacterial cellulose synthase operon and genes for redirecting the carbon from the central metabolic pathway to gluconeogenesis. According to the genome annotations, a BC production route from acetyl-CoA, a central metabolic intermediate, was hypothesized and was validated using acetate. We identified that when \textit{K. rhaeticus} ENS9b was grown in a minimal medium supplemented with acetate, BC production was not observed. However, in the presence of readily utilizable substrates, such as spent yeast hydrolysate, acetate supplementation improved BC synthesis.},

Among the genes that were upregulated or downregulated in response to \textit{Alu} overexpression in IMR90, but not in HeLa cells, we found a highly significant enrichment of pathways involved in cell cycle progression and mitotic entry. Accordingly, \textit{Alu} overexpression was found to promote transition from G1 to S phase, as revealed by flow cytometry.

@phdthesis{cantarella_insights_2020,
 abstract = {A large portion of the human genome is composed of repeated sequences, with Alu retrotransposons representing the most abundant repetitive elements. Alu sequences belong to the class of the Short Interspersed Nuclear Elements (SINEs) and depend on the Long Interspersed Nuclear Elements (LINEs) for their mobilization into the genome. The efficiency of Alu amplification during primate evolution suggests a positive driving force for their accumulation, bringing up to 1 million copies in the human genome. For unclear reasons, the majority of Alu sequences is repressed by tight epigenetic silencing, which is released in response to cell stresses such as virus infection and cancer progression. Adenovirus 5 (Ad5) is known to cause an increase of Alu transcription in HeLa, myelogenous leukemia and embryonic kidney cell lines, even though the virus factors that are responsible for this transcriptional enhancement have not been identified yet. Potential candidates could be represented by oncovirus proteins that induce a global remodeling of the host epigenetic landscape. For example, the Adenovirus early E1A protein interacts with the host tumor suppressor Rb, the lysine acetylase p300 and the p400 ATP-dependent chromatin remodeling complex, resulting in the induction of quiescent fibroblasts to enter the S-phase of the cell cycle. 
The exceptional success of Alu expansion and their retention even at the cost of a strong epigenetic silencing, which is released by virus infection, led us to investigate the molecular mechanism of Alus activation and their potential involvement in various cell processes.  
Firstly, genome-wide Alu profiling was performed in quiescent human primary fibroblasts infected with the Ad5 dl1500 mutant, which only expresses the oncovirus small E1A protein. A total of 1880 Polymerase III (Pol III) transcribed Alus were detected through high throughput RNA-sequencing (RNA-seq), revealing a 4-fold increase of the average Alu expression induced by small E1A.   
With the aim of identifying small E1A-host protein interactions that are crucial for the activation of Alu expression, the host proteins Rb, p300 and p400 were put under investigation. Alu expression profiling was performed in cells infected with small E1A mutants that are not capable to bind Rb, p300 or p400. RNA-seq and RT-qPCR data revealed that the small E1A-p400 binding mutant was the least efficient in activating Alu expression, whereas a milder effect was reported for small E1A-Rb and small E1A-p300 binding mutants. Moreover, ChIP-sequencing (ChIP-seq) analyses of dl1500 infected fibroblasts revealed an enrichment of H3K4me1 within the body of small E1A-induced Alus. Our data point toward the existence of H3K4me1 Alu loci that are recognized by p400 bound by small E1A, resulting in Alu transcription in response to virus infection. 
Secondly, two Alu sequences were stably overexpressed in one primary and one cancer cell line (human fibroblasts and HeLa cells, respectively) and differential gene expression in Alu-overexpressing cells was performed through RNA-seq data analysis. Among the two Alu- overexpressing fibroblast cell lines, 330 genes were detected as Differentially Expressed (DE), whereas only two genes were differentially expressed in HeLa cells. Interestingly, DE genes detected in Alu-overexpressing fibroblasts were significantly enriched in pathways belonging to cell cycle progression and mitotic entry. The promotion of cell cycle was also supported by a significantly higher percentage of cells in the S-phase compared to control samples as revealed by flow cytometry.  
The studies conducted in this work identify Ad5 small E1A as one of the virus factors that enhance Alu transcription, possibly through binding with the p400 complex. Interestingly, the overexpression of two Alu sequences in human fibroblasts leads to the stimulation of cell cycle progression, resulting in the same phenotype as previously observed in Ad5 infected fibroblasts. This brings us to speculate that the overexpression of Alu sequences during stress response to viral infection could be exploited by Ad5 to sustain cell proliferation.},

 abstract = {Providencia stuartii is a member of the Morganellaceae family, notorious for its intrinsic resistance to several antibiotics, including last-resort drugs such as colistin and tigecycline. Between February and March 2022, a four-patient outbreak sustained by P. stuartii occurred in a hospital in Rome. Phenotypic analyses defined these strains as eXtensively Drug-Resistant (XDR). Whole-genome sequencing was performed on the representative P. stuartii strains and resulted in fully closed genomes and plasmids. The genomes were highly related phylogenetically and encoded various virulence factors, including fimbrial clusters. The XDR phenotype was primarily driven by the presence of the blaNDM-1 metallo-β-lactamase alongside the rmtC 16S rRNA methyltransferase, conferring resistance to most β-lactams and every aminoglycoside, respectively. These genes were found on an IncC plasmid that was highly related to an NDM-IncC plasmid retrieved from a ST15 Klebsiella pneumoniae strain circulating in the same hospital two years earlier. Given its ability to acquire resistance plasmids and its intrinsic resistance mechanisms, P. stuartii is a formidable pathogen. The emergence of XDR P. stuartii strains poses a significant public health threat. It is essential to monitor the spread of these strains and develop new strategies for their control and treatment.},

 abstract = {Centromeres are epigenetically specified by the histone H3 variant CENP-A and typically associated with highly repetitive satellite DNA. We previously discovered natural satellite-free neocentromeres in Equus caballus and Equus asinus. Here, through ChIP-seq with an anti-CENP-A antibody, we found an extraordinarily high number of centromeres lacking satellite DNA in the zebras Equus burchelli (15 of 22) and Equus grevyi (13 of 23), demonstrating that the absence of satellite DNA at the majority of centromeres is compatible with genome stability and species survival and challenging the role of satellite DNA in centromere function. Nine satellite-free centromeres are shared between the two species in agreement with their recent separation. We assembled all centromeric regions and improved the reference genome of E. burchelli. Sequence analysis of the CENP-A binding domains revealed that they are LINE-1 and AT-rich with four of them showing DNA amplification. In the two zebras, satellite-free centromeres emerged from centromere repositioning or following Robertsonian fusion. In five chromosomes, the centromeric function arose near the fusion points, which are located within regions marked by traces of ancestral pericentromeric sequences. Therefore, besides centromere repositioning, Robertsonian fusions are an important source of satellite-free centromeres during evolution. Finally, in one case, a satellite-free centromere was seeded on an inversion breakpoint. At 11 chromosomes, whose primary constrictions seemed to be associated with satellite repeats by cytogenetic analysis, satellite-free neocentromeres were instead located near the ancestral inactivated satellite-based centromeres; therefore, the centromeric function has shifted away from a satellite repeat containing locus to a satellite-free new position.},

 abstract = {From January 2019 to April 2020, 32 KPC-producing, ceftazidime-avibactam (CZA)-resistant Klebsiella pneumoniae strains were isolated in a university hospital in Rome, Italy. These strains belonged to the sequence type 512 (ST512), ST101, and ST307 high-risk clones. Nine different CZA-resistant KPC-3 protein variants were identified, five of them never previously reported (KPC-66 to KPC-70). Among the nine, KPC-31, KPC-39, KPC-49, KPC-66, KP-68, KPC-69, and KPC-70 showed amino acid substitutions, insertions, and deletions in the Ω loop of the protein. KPC-29 has a duplication, while the novel KPC-67 has a triplication, of the KDD triplet in the 270-loop, a secondary loop of the KPC-3 protein. Genomics performed on contemporary resistant and susceptible clones underlined that these novel mutations emerged in \textit{bla}$_{\textrm{KPC-3}}$ genes located on conserved plasmids: in ST512, all \textit{bla}$_{\textrm{KPC-3}}$ mutant genes were located in pKpQIL plasmids, while the three novel \textit{bla}$_{\textrm{KPC-3}}$ mutants identified in ST101 were on FIIk-FIA(HI1)-R plasmids. Selection also promoted multiplication of the carbapenemase gene copy number by transposition, recombination, and fusion of resident plasmids. When expressed in Escherichia coli recipient cells cloned in the high-copy-number pTOPO vector, the Ω loop mutated variants showed the CZA-resistant phenotype associated with susceptibility to carbapenems, while KPC variants with insertions in the 270-loop showed residual activity on carbapenems. The investigation of CZA resistance mechanisms offered the unique opportunity to study vertical, horizontal, and oblique evolutionary trajectories of K. pneumoniae high-risk clones.},

 abstract = {Chloroviruses exhibit a close relationship with their hosts with the phenotypic aspect of their ability to form lytic plaques having primarily guided the taxonomy. However, with the isolation of viruses that are only able to complete their replication cycle in one strain of \textit{Chlorella variabilis}, systematic challenges emerged. In this study, we described the genomic features of 53 new chlorovirus isolates and used them to elucidate part of the evolutionary history and taxonomy of this clade. Our analysis revealed new chloroviruses with the largest genomes to date ({\textgreater}400 kbp) and indicated that four genomic features are statistically different in the viruses that only infect the Syngen 2-3 strain of \textit{C. variabilis} (OSy viruses). We found large regions of dissimilarity in the genomes of viruses PBCV-1 and OSy-NE5 when compared with the other genomes. These regions contained genes related to the interaction with the host cell machinery and viral capsid proteins, which provided insights into the evolution of the replicative and structural modules in these giant viruses. Phylogenetic analysis using hallmark genes of \textit{Nucleocytoviricota} revealed that OSy-viruses evolved from the NC64A-viruses, possibly emerging as a result of the strict relationship with their hosts. Merging phylogenetics and nucleotide identity analyses, we propose strategies to demarcate viral species, resulting in seven new species of chloroviruses. Collectively, our results show how genomic data can be used as lines of evidence to demarcate viral species. Using the chloroviruses as a case study, we expect that similar initiatives will emerge using the basis exhibited here.IMPORTANCEChloroviruses are a group of giant viruses with long dsDNA genomes that infect different species of \textit{Chlorella-}like green algae. They are host-specific, and some isolates can only replicate within a single strain of \textit{Chlorella variabilis}. The genomics of these viruses is still poorly explored, and the characterization of new isolates provides important data on their genetic diversity and evolution. In this work, we describe 53 new chlorovirus genomes, including many isolated from alkaline lakes for the first time. Through comparative genomics and molecular phylogeny, we provide evidence of genomic gigantism in chloroviruses and show that a subset of viruses became highly specific for their hosts at a particular point in evolutionary history. We propose criteria to demarcate species of chloroviruses, paving the way for an update in the taxonomy of other groups of viruses. This study is a new and important piece in the complex puzzle of giant algal viruses.},

In the face of these variations, plants sense temperature to adjust their functions and minimize the negative consequences. Transcriptome responses underlie changes in growth, development, and biochemistry (thermomorphogenesis and acclimation to extreme temperatures). We are only beginning to understand temperature sensation by plants. Multiple thermosensors convey complementary temperature information to a given signaling network to control gene expression. Temperature-induced changes in protein or transcript structure and/or in the dynamics of biomolecular condensates are the core sensing mechanisms of known thermosensors, but temperature impinges on their activities via additional indirect pathways. The diversity of plant responses to temperature anticipates that many new thermosensors and eventually novel sensing mechanisms will be uncovered soon.},

The integration of tandem mass spectrometry molecular networking and bioassay-guided fractionation unveiled this strain as a prolific factory of surfactins and nobilamides.

Among these, four major compounds were isolated, including the known TL-119 and nobilamide I, as well as the two new nobilamides T1 and S1. TL-119 and nobilamide S1 exhibited potent antibiotic activity against various multidrug-resistant Staphylococcus strains and other Gram-positive pathogens, including the foodborne pathogen Listeria monocytogenes. Finally, in silico analysis of Bacillus halotolerans BCP32 genome revealed nobilamide biosynthesis to be directed by a previously unknown heptamodular nonribosomal peptide synthetase.},

Species identification was performed using Sanger sequencing of the 16S rRNA gene and Whole-Genome Sequencing (WGS) for both strains. Genomic analyses for the two isolates, BLAST similarity search, and phylogeny for the 16S rDNA sequences lead to an assignment to the species Pannonibacter phragmitetus. However, by performing ANIb, ANIm, tetranucleotide correlation, and DNA-DNA digital hybridization, analyses of the two draft genomes showed that they were very different from those of the species P. phragmitetus.

 abstract = {Cell membranes are thought of as barriers to extracellular RNA (exRNA) uptake. While naked exRNAs can be spontaneously internalized by certain cells, functional cytosolic delivery has been rarely observed. Here, we show that extracellular ribonucleases (RNases)-primarily from cell culture supplements-have obscured the study of exRNA functionality. When ribonuclease inhibitor (RI) is added to cell cultures, naked exRNAs can trigger pro-inflammatory responses in dendritic cells and macrophages, largely via endosomal Toll-like receptors (TLRs). Moreover, naked exRNAs can escape endosomes, engaging cytosolic RNA sensors. In addition, naked extracellular mRNAs can be spontaneously internalized and translated by various cell types in an RI-dependent manner. In vivo, RI co-injection amplifies naked-RNA-induced activation of splenic lymphocytes and myeloid leukocytes. Furthermore, naked RNA is inherently pro-inflammatory in RNase-poor compartments like the peritoneal cavity. These findings demonstrate that naked RNA is bioactive without requiring vesicular encapsulation, making a case for nonvesicular-exRNA-mediated intercellular communication.},

Phylogenetic analyses revealed that both Machilidae and Machilinae are paraphyletic; Pedetontinus included in this analysis formed a well-supported monophyletic clade, whereas the sampled Pedetontus species were not recovered as a monophyletic clade. Divergence time estimates indicate that Archaeognatha originated during the Late Carboniferous (301.15 Mya, 95\% HPD: 298.88–303.67 Mya), with subsequent diversification spanning from the Mesozoic era to the present. The adaptive radiation of epiphytic bryophytes and potential coevolutionary interactions between plants and insects are proposed to have significantly contributed to the diversification of Archaeognatha. Based on multiple lines of evidence, we propose that the current morphological criteria for species delineation within Pedetontus (Pd.) require revision to better reflect its evolutionary history. In the branch-site model analysis, when Pd. silvestrii—collected from temperate regions—was designated as the foreground branch, two positively selected sites were detected at the 66th position of the Cytb and the 34th position of ATP6. When Pd. hainanensis and Pd. bawanglingensis—collected from tropical regions—were used as the foreground branches, six positively selected sites were identified at the 622nd position of Cytb, the 499th position of ATP6, and the 623rd, 873rd, 1106th, and 1141st positions of COI.},

 abstract = {Archaeognatha (bristletails) represent an evolutionarily significant but understudied insect group. Notably, the morphological identification method proposed by Mendes for Archaeognatha has certain limitations, which may lead to the underestimation or misidentification of some cryptic species. To address this issue, we employed an integrated strategy that combines morphological and molecular identification methods. Therefore, this study aimed to (1) identify cryptic diversity within Pedetontus silvestrii using mitogenomic data; (2) clarify phylogenetic relationships among Archaeognatha lineages; and (3) estimate divergence times for key taxonomic splits. We analyzed mitochondrial genomes from six P. silvestrii populations (Liaoning, Jilin, and Hebei Provinces) alongside 14 published Archaeognatha genomes. Key findings include the following: (1) Integrative analyses of genetic distances, phylogenetic reconstruction, bPTP-based molecular species delimitation, and divergence time estimation collectively revealed four evolutionarily distinct lineages within P. silvestrii. (2) Machilidae and Machilinae were non-monophyletic, whereas Petrobiellinae showed close affinity to Meinertellidae. (3) Archaeognatha originated {\textasciitilde}301.19 Mya (Late Carboniferous); the Machilinae–Petrobiinae split occurred approximately 153.99 Mya (Jurassic). This study underscores the critical importance of mitogenomic analysis in elucidating cryptic biodiversity, while emphasizing the necessity of integrating morphological identification with molecular characterization for comprehensive species delineation in future taxonomic investigations.},

 abstract = {In plants, posttranscriptional gene silencing (PTGS) is induced by small RNAs (sRNAs) generated from various dsRNA precursors. To assess the impact of dsRNA origin, we compared downregulation of GFP expression triggered by inverted repeat (IR), antisense (AS) and unterminated sense (UT) transcripts transiently expressed from the estradiol-inducible promoter. The use of homogeneously responding tobacco BY-2 cell lines allowed monitoring the onset of silencing and its reversibility. In this system, IR induced the strongest and fastest silencing accompanied by dense DNA methylation. At low induction, silencing in individual cells was binary (either strong or missing), suggesting that a certain threshold sRNA level had to be exceeded. The AS variant specifically showed a deviated sRNA-strand ratio shifted in favor of antisense orientation. In AS lines and weakly induced IR lines, only the silencer DNA was methylated, but the same target GFP sequence was not, showing that DNA methylation accompanying PTGS was influenced both by the level and origin of sRNAs, and possibly also by the epigenetic state of the locus. UT silencing appeared to be the least effective and resembled classical sense PTGS. The best responding UT lines behaved relatively heterogeneously possibly due to complexly arranged T-DNA insertions. Unlike IR and AS variants that fully restored GFP expression upon removal of the inducer, only partial reactivation was observed in some UT lines. Our results pointed out several not yet described phenomena and differences between the long-known silencer variants that may direct further research and affect selection of proper silencer variants for specific applications.},

The medical uses of sage essential oil terpenoids have made these secondary metabolites a focus of medical/pharmaceutical chemistry research. In the present work, the common sage genome was resequenced and assembled, and the protein-encoding gene content was annotated. The terpenoid biosynthesis gene repertoire, which includes 75 terpene synthase and 67 terpenoid backbone biosynthesis pathway genes, was predicted and located on assembly scaffolds, revealing tandem duplication blocks on the chromosomes. Variant analysis identified 188 variable single-nucleotide loci in the coding sequences of sage terpenoid biosynthesis genes. A total of 24,570 single-nucleotide polymorphisms were identified in the common sage total exome, representing a database of potential variable loci for targeted genotyping research. Given that terpene synthase activity is highly prone to modulation by point mutations and that the genotype plays an important role in the complex traits of terpenoid composition, single-nucleotide polymorphisms located in coding sequences constitute candidate functional markers that can be associated with terpenoid compositional traits in future research.},

ST48 is a particularly concerning sequence type and an emerging international clone linked to global spread and MDR infections. This study examines the comprehensive genomic epidemiology of the local and global populations of K. pneumoniae ST48 strains using whole genomes sequence data. We performed phenotypic and genotypic characterization of a K. pneumoniae strain S3C and conducted molecular epidemiological analyses of local ST48 isolates in Bangladesh, followed by pan-genome and phylogenetic analyses of 397 global ST48 strains. The S3C strain was resistant to 17 out of 19 tested antibiotics and was a moderate biofilm former. Whole genome sequencing identified it as ST48 clonal type, with 13 acquired antibiotic resistance genes, 76 virulence-associated genes, and multiple mobile genetic elements. Comparative analysis of Bangladeshi ST48 strains indicated a high prevalence of MDR genes, particularly bla$_{\textrm{CTX-M-15}}$, and a diverse array of virulence factors associated with biofilm formation, siderophore production, capsular biosynthesis and others. Pan-genome analysis of Bangladeshi ST48 strains revealed 8,030 genes, with 56.26\% classified as core genes. In contrast, global ST48 strains had 16,307 genes, with 75.3\% as accessory genes, highlighting extensive genomic plasticity. The phylogenetic analysis revealed that isolates from different regions clustered within the major clade, indicating the global dissemination of this sequence type. Our findings underscore the substantial genomic diversity and high resistance levels of K. pneumoniae ST48, emphasizing the need for targeted infection control measures and continuous surveillance.},

Kutzneria, a rare actinobacteria belonging to the family Pseudonocardiaceae has abundance of secondary metabolite biosynthetic gene clusters (BGCs) and is one of important source of natural products and worthy of priority investigation. Currently, Kutzneria chonburiensis SMC256T has been the latest type-strain of the genus and its genome sequence has not been reported yet. Therefore, we present the first report of new complete genome sequence of SMC256T (genome size of 10.4 Mbp) with genome annotation and feature comparison between SMC256T and other publicly available Kutzneria species. The results from comparative and functional genomic analyses regarding the phylogenomic and the clusters of orthologous groups of proteins (COGs) analyses indicated that SMC256T is most closely related to Kutzneria sp. 744, Kutzneria kofuensis, Kutzneria sp. CA-103260 and Kutzneria buriramensis. Furthermore, a total of 322 BGCs were also detected and showed diversity among the Kutzneria genomes. Out of which, 38 clusters showing the best hit to the most known BGCs were predicted in the SMC256Tgenome. We observed that six clusters responsible for biosynthesis of antimicrobials/antitumor metabolites were strain-specific in Kutzneria chonburiensis. These putative metabolites include virginiamycin S1, lysolipin I, esmeraldin, rakicidin, aclacinomycin and streptoseomycin. Based on these findings, the genome of Kutzneria chonburiensis contains distinct and unidentified BGCs different from other members of the genus, and the use of integrative genomic-based approach would be a useful alternative effort to target, isolate and identify putative and undiscovered secondary metabolites suspected to have new and/or specific bioactivity in the Kutzneria.},

Here, we reveal that fission yeast Mrc1 (CLASPIN in humans) binds H3-H4 tetramers and operates as a central coordinator of symmetric parental histone inheritance. Mrc1 mutants in a key connector domain disrupted segregation of parental histones to the lagging strand comparable to Mcm2 histone-binding mutants. Both mutants showed clonal and asymmetric loss of H3K9me-mediated gene silencing. AlphaFold predicted co-chaperoning of H3-H4 tetramers by Mrc1 and Mcm2, with the Mrc1 connector domain bridging histone and Mcm2 binding. Biochemical and functional analysis validated this model and revealed a duality in Mrc1 function: disabling histone binding in the connector domain disrupted lagging-strand recycling while another histone-binding mutation impaired leading strand recycling. We propose that Mrc1 toggles histones between the lagging and leading strand recycling pathways, in part by intra-replisome co-chaperoning, to ensure epigenetic transmission to both daughter cells.},

Although this TF family has been examined in a multitude of plants, the R2R3-MYB TFs in Ficus carica, a Mediterranean fruit species, have yet to be characterized. This study identified and classified 63 R2R3-MYB genes (FcMYB1 to FcMYB63) in the F. carica genome. We analyzed these genes for physicochemical properties, conserved motifs, phylogenetic relationships, gene architecture, selection pressure, and gene expression profiles and networks. The genes were classified into 29 clades, with members of the same clade showing similar exon–intron structures and motif compositions. Of the 54 orthologous gene pairs shared with mulberry (Morus notabilis), 52 evolved under negative selection, while two pairs (FcMYB55/MnMYB20 and FcMYB59/MnMYB31) experienced diversifying selection. RNA-Seq analysis showed that FcMYB26, FcMYB33, and FcMYB34 were significantly overexpressed in fig fruit peel during maturation phase III. Weighted gene co-expression network analysis (WGCNA) indicated that these genes are part of an expression module associated with the anthocyanin pathway. RT-qPCR validation confirmed these findings and revealed that the Tunisian cultivars 'Zidi' and 'Soltani' have cultivar-specific R2R3-FcMYB genes highly overexpressed during the final stage of fruit maturation and color acquisition. These genes likely influence cultivar-specific pigment synthesis. This study provides a comprehensive overview of the R2R3-MYB TF family in fig, offering a framework for selecting genes related to fruit peel color in breeding programs.},

 abstract = {The cortical plate (CP) is composed of excitatory and inhibitory neurons, the latter of which originate in the ganglionic eminences. From their origin in the ventral telencephalon, maturing postmitotic interneurons migrate during embryonic development over some distance to reach their final destination in the CP. The histone methyltransferase Disruptor of Telomeric Silencing 1-like (DOT1L) is necessary for proper CP development and layer distribution of glutamatergic neurons. However, its specific role on cortical interneuron development has not yet been explored. Here, we demonstrate that DOT1L affects interneuron development in a cell autonomous manner. Deletion of Dot1l in Nkx2.1-expressing interneuron precursor cells results in an overall reduction and altered distribution of GABAergic interneurons in the CP from postnatal day 0 onwards. We observed an altered proportion of GABAergic interneurons in the cortex, with a significant decrease in parvalbumin-expressing interneurons. Moreover, a decreased number of mitotic cells at the embryonic day E14.5 was observed upon Dot1l deletion. Altogether, our results indicate that reduced numbers of cortical interneurons upon DOT1L deletion result from premature cell cycle exit, but effects on postmitotic differentiation, maturation, and migration are likely at play as well.},

 abstract = {BackgroundPyridine-2,6-dicarboxylic acid (DPA) is a valuable dicarboxylic acid that has the potential to serve as a precursor for bio-sustainable and bio-degradable materials and self-healing polymers. It also plays a crucial role in the heat resistance of Bacillus subtilis spores. However, extracting DPA from spores is resource-intensive and technically complex, limiting its industrial application. To overcome these challenges, this study aims to engineer B. subtilis as a microbial cell factory for the direct production of free and soluble DPA.ResultsThis study first demonstrated that blocking sporulation reduced DPA production due to the repression of dipicolinate synthase expression. To enhance extracellular DPA production, dipicolinate synthase expression was fine-tuned, increasing the extracellular DPA titer to 330 ± 10 mg/l in strain BSDYvyDVF. Transcriptomic analysis revealed that spore coat assembly genes modulate DPA production. By disrupting a spore coat assembly activator in strain BSDYvyDVF-gerE, sporulation was successfully inhibited, significantly boosting the DPA yield to 944 ± 3 mg/l. Further optimization of fermentation conditions was performed using an orthogonal design. The highest DPA titer of 1250 mg/l was achieved and validated through fed-batch fermentation in a 1.5-l bioreactor.ConclusionThis study demonstrates the potential of engineered B. subtilis BSDYvyDVF-gerE as an efficient cell factory for sustainable DPA biosynthesis. In addition, it identifies key challenges in DPA production, including synthesis efficiency (regulation of key enzyme expression) and transport (intracellular-to-extracellular export), and proposes corresponding solutions.},

It also drives prostate tumorigenesis when hijacked for oncogenic transcription. The execution of growth-suppressive AR transcriptional programs in prostate cancer (PCa) and the potential for reactivation remain unclear. Here, we use a genome-wide approach to modulate canonical androgen response element (ARE) motifs—the classic DNA binding elements for AR—to delineate distinct AR transcriptional programs. We find that activating these AREs promotes differentiation and growth-suppressive transcription, potentially leading to AR+ PCa cell death, while ARE repression is tolerated by PCa cells but deleterious to normal prostate cells. Gene signatures driven by ARE activity correlate with improved prognosis and luminal phenotypes in PCa patients. Canonical AREs maintain a normal, lineage-specific transcriptional program that can be reengaged in PCa cells, offering therapeutic potential and clinical relevance.},

Despite the role of mitochondria as energy metabolism centers during hibernation, the adaptive and evolutionary mechanisms of mitochondrial genes in hibernating animals, like hedgehogs in eulipotyphlan species, are not yet fully understood. In this study, we sequenced and assembled mitochondrial genomes of the hibernating four-toed hedgehog (Atelerix albiventris) and the non-hibernating Asian house shrew (Suncus murinus). While no significant positive selection was detected, we identified unique amino acid substitutions and accelerated evolutionary rates of mitochondrial proteins and the encoding genes in hibernating hedgehogs. Moreover, the distinctive evolutionary patterns indicated a potential link among the adaptive evolution of mitochondrial genes (such as ATP6, CYTB, and ND6), the phenotypes of hibernation and longevity in eulipotyphlan species. These three genes evolved rapidly in hibernating Erinaceidae species and exhibited significant correlations with the two distinct phenotypes, indicating their pivotal roles in the evolution of hibernation and longevity. These findings provide insights into the genetic mechanisms responsible for metabolic plasticity and longevity in eulipotyphlan hibernators, with implications for other mammalian taxa.},

 abstract = {Parasitism is an important lifestyle in the \textit{Trichoderma} genus but has not been studied in a genus-wide way toward \textit{Pythium} and \textit{Globisporangium} hosts. Our approach screened a genus-wide set of 30 \textit{Trichoderma} species in dual culture assays with two soil-borne \textit{Pythium} and three \textit{Globisporangium} plant-parasitic species and used exo-proteomic analyses, with the aim to correlate \textit{Trichoderma} antagonism with potential strategies for attacking \textit{Pythium} and \textit{Globisporangium}. The \textit{Trichoderma} spp. showed a wide range of antagonism from strong to weak, but the same \textit{Trichoderma} strain showed similar levels toward all the \textit{Pythium} and \textit{Globisporangium} species. The \textit{Trichoderma} enzymes from strong (\textit{Trichoderma asperellum}, \textit{Trichoderma atroviride}, and \textit{Trichoderma virens}), moderate (\textit{Trichoderma} cf. \textit{guizhouense} and \textit{Trichoderma reesei}), and weak (\textit{Trichoderma parepimyces}) antagonists were induced by the autoclaved mycelia of one of the screened \textit{Pythium} species, \textit{Pythium myriotylum}. The variable proportions of putative cellulases, proteases, and redox enzymes suggested diverse as well as shared strategies amongst the antagonists. There was a partial positive correlation between antagonism from microscopy and the cellulase activity induced by autoclaved \textit{P. myriotylum} mycelia in different \textit{Trichoderma} species. The deletion of the cellulase transcriptional activator XYR1 in \textit{T. reesei} led to lower antagonism toward \textit{Pythium} and \textit{Globisporangium}. The antagonism of \textit{Pythium} and \textit{Globisporangium} appears to be a generic property of \textit{Trichoderma} as most of the \textit{Trichoderma} species were at least moderately antagonistic. While a role for cellulases in the antagonism was uncovered, cellulases did not appear to make a major contribution to \textit{T. reesei} antagonism, and other factors are also likely contributing.IMPORTANCE\textit{Trichoderma} is an important genus widely distributed in nature with broad ecological impacts and applications in the biocontrol of plant diseases. The \textit{Pythium} and \textit{Globisporangium} genera of fungus-like water molds include many important soil-borne plant pathogens that cause various diseases. Most of the \textit{Trichoderma} species showed at least a moderate ability to compete with or antagonize the \textit{Pythium} and \textit{Globisporangium} hosts, and microscopy showed examples of parasitism (a slow type of killing) and predation (a fast type of killing). Hydrolytic enzymes such as cellulases and proteases produced by \textit{Trichoderma} likely contribute to the antagonism. A mutant deficient in cellulase activity had reduced antagonism. Interestingly, \textit{Pythium} and \textit{Globisporangium} species contain cellulose in their cell walls (unlike true fungi such as \textit{Trichoderma}), and the cellulolytic ability of \textit{Trichoderma} appears beneficial for antagonism of water molds.},

@article{chen_high-light_2025,
 abstract = {Photosynthetic organisms have evolved mechanisms to manage excess light, crucial for maximizing photosynthetic efficiency. High-light (HL) tolerant Synechocystis sp. PCC6803 strains were developed through laboratory evolution, with tolerance attributed to specific point mutations. Key mutations affected the NDH-1L complex F1-subunit (NdhF1 F124L ) and translation elongation factor G2 (EF-G2 R461C ). Reintroducing these mutations into laboratory strains conferred HL tolerance. Comparisons with knockout and overexpressor lines showed NdhF1 F124L and EF-G2 R461C result in gain of function. Transcriptomic and proteomic analysis unveiled a network of responses contributing to HL tolerance, including maintenance of phosphate metabolism and decreased antenna size by depleting a specific linker protein in EF-G2 R461C cells. Consequently, overexpression of Pho regulon genes increased HL tolerance. NdhF1 F124L enhances cyclic electron flow (CEF) by increasing NDH-1 complex subunit accumulation. Other HL-adapted strains demonstrated that increased CEF and decreased antenna size are recurring outcomes, achievable through various mutations. This study demonstrates how limited mutations can reconfigure cells for enhanced HL tolerance, offering insights for improving photosynthetic efficiency.},

@article{chen_terrestrial_2025,
 abstract = {Background/Objectives: Mitochondrial genomes are widely used in phylogenetics and evolutionary and ecological research. Methods: In this study, the newest mitochondrial genome of Chelonoidis vicina was assembled and annotated. The comparative mitochondrial genome and selection pressure analyses were used to examine the terrestrial adaptive evolution characteristics of C. vicina and other terrestrial reptiles. Results: The results reveal that the mitochondrial genome of the tortoise C. vicina is consistent with that of other tortoise species, comprising 13 protein-coding genes (PCGs), 2 rRNAs, 22 tRNAs, and 1 noncoding control region (CR). The analysis of selection pressure reveals the presence of positive selection sites in the COX2, COX3, Cytb, ND3, ND4, ND4L, ND5, and ND6 genes of terrestrial reptiles. Of these, the COX2 and ND3 genes exhibited faster evolutionary rates. The mitochondrial genome structure of C. vicina is consistent with that of different terrestrial reptiles. The positive selection sites of COX2 and ND3 in terrestrial reptiles are closely related to a change in mitochondrial energy metabolism, which is possibly related to terrestrial adaptability. Conclusions: The results of this study provide new insights into the adaptive evolution of C. vicina to terrestrial niches from a mitogenomic perspective, as well as genetic resources for the protection of C. vicina.},

@article{cheron_usp7maged1-mediated_2023,
 abstract = {The risk of developing drug addiction is strongly influenced by the epigenetic landscape and chromatin remodeling. While histone modifications such as methylation and acetylation have been studied in the ventral tegmental area and nucleus accumbens (NAc), the role of H2A monoubiquitination remains unknown. Our investigations, initially focused on the scaffold protein melanoma-associated antigen D1 (Maged1), reveal that H2A monoubiquitination in the paraventricular thalamus (PVT) significantly contributes to cocaine-adaptive behaviors and transcriptional repression induced by cocaine. Chronic cocaine use increases H2A monoubiquitination, regulated by Maged1 and its partner USP7. Accordingly, Maged1 specific inactivation in thalamic Vglut2 neurons, or USP7 inhibition, blocks cocaine-evoked H2A monoubiquitination and cocaine locomotor sensitization. Additionally, genetic variations in MAGED1 and USP7 are linked to altered susceptibility to cocaine addiction and cocaine-associated symptoms in humans. These findings unveil an epigenetic modification in a non-canonical reward pathway of the brain and a potent marker of epigenetic risk factors for drug addiction in humans.},

@article{cherrad_new_2023,
 abstract = {Downy mildew is caused by Plasmopara viticola, an obligate oomycete plant pathogen, a devasting disease of grapevine. To protect plants from the disease, complex III inhibitors are among the fungicides widely used. They specifically target the mitochondrial cytochrome b (cytb) of the pathogen to block cellular respiration mechanisms. In the French vineyard, P. viticola has developed resistance against a first group of these fungicides, the Quinone outside Inhibitors (QoI), with a single amino acid substitution G143A in its cytb mitochondrial sequence. The use of QoI was limited and another type of fungicide, the Quinone inside Inhibitors, targeting the same gene and highly effective against oomycetes, was used instead. Recently however, less sensitive P. viticola populations were detected after treatments with some inhibitors, in particular ametoctradin and cyazofamid. By isolating single-sporangia P. viticola strains resistant to these fungicides, we characterized new variants in the cytb sequences associated with cyazofamid resistance: a point mutation (L201S) and more strikingly, two insertions (E203-DE-V204, E203-VE-V204). In parallel with the classical tools, pyrosequencing and qPCR, we then benchmarked short and long-reads NGS technologies (Ion Torrent, Illumina, Oxford Nanopore Technologies) to sequence the complete cytb with a view to detecting and assessing the proportion of resistant variants of P. viticola at the scale of a field population. Eighteen populations collected from French vineyard fields in 2020 were analysed: 12 showed a variable proportion of G143A, 11 of E203-DE-V204 and 7 populations of the S34L variant that confers resistance to ametoctradin. Interestingly, the long reads were able to identify variants, including SNPs, with confidence and to detect a small proportion of P. viticola with multiple variants along the same cytb sequence. Overall, NGS appears to be a promising method for assessing fungicide resistance of pathogens linked to cytb modifications at the field population level. This approach could rapidly become a robust decision support tool for resistance management in the future.},

 abstract = {Gall mites (Eriophyoidea) are cosmopolitan microscopic phytoparasites that often transmit viruses and induce gallogenesis. The tribe Calacarini is diagnosed by a set of plesiomorphic and homoplastic traits, including elimination of setae sc shared with other lineages of Eriophyoidea. We reviewed data on the generic diversity of calacarines, revised the concept of the type genus Calacarus Keifer 1940, and proposed three zones (MZ, SMZ, LZ) in the prodorsal shields of calacarines to simplify descriptions of their shield patterns. We describe three new calacarine species (Calacarus baviensisn. sp., C. burchelliaen. sp., and Viginticus searsiaen. sp.) from indigenous dicotyledonous trees from South Africa and Vietnam and report on new findings of Paracalacarus podocarpi Keifer in Brazil, Jiangsuacarus sp. in the USA, and Calacarus pusillus Pye in Latvia and Russia. The latter represents the new most northern locality of Calacarini. Reinvestigating the type species of Jaranasia Chandrapatya \& Boczek 2000 revealed that absence of setae l’’ II is the only character separating it from Jiangsuacarus Xue 2009. We proposed two new combinations: Jiangsuacarus sesleriae (Skoracka 2004) n. comb. (transferred from Jaranasia) and Procalacarus mussaendae (Keifer 1977) n. comb. (transferred from Calacarus). Partial sequences of Cox1 and 28S genes were obtained for six calacarines, some of them originating from old ethanol material kept at room temperature. Molecular phylogenetics revealed a stable cluster of “true” calacarine sequences comprising Calacarus, Jaranasia, Latitudo, and Viginticus and a polyphyletic group of erroneous sequences assigned to Calacarini in GenBank. All investigated females of calacarines have a pair of genital tubules associated with the vestibulum and hypothesized to participate in fertilization. This finding may contribute to resolving the question on how the fusion of gametes happens in gall mites.},

 abstract = {Venomous marine gastropods of the superfamily Conoidea possess a rich arsenal of toxins, including neuroactive toxins. Venom adaptations might have played a fundamental role in the radiation of conoideans; nevertheless, there is still no knowledge about the venom of the most diversified family of the group: Raphitomidae Bellardi, 1875. In this study, transcriptomes were produced from the carcase, salivary glands, and proximal and distal venom ducts of the northeastern Atlantic species Raphitoma purpurea (Montagu, 1803). Using a gut barcoding approach, we were also able to report, for the first time, molecular evidence of a vermivorous diet for the genus. Transcriptomic analyses revealed over a hundred putative venom components (PVC), including 69 neurotoxins. Twenty novel toxin families, including some with high levels of expansion, were discovered. No significant difference was observed between the distal and proximal venom duct secretions. Peptides related to cone snail toxins (Cerm06, Pgam02, and turritoxin) and other venom-related proteins (disulfide isomerase and elevenin) were retrieved from the salivary glands. These salivary venom components may constitute ancestral adaptations for venom production in conoideans. Although often neglected, salivary gland secretions are of extreme importance for understanding the evolutionary history of conoidean venom.},

The ongoing COVID-19 pandemic poses one of the greatest global threats in modern history and has already caused severe social and economic costs. The development of efficient and rapid sequencing methods to reconstruct the genomic sequence of SARS-CoV-2, the etiological agent of COVID-19, has been fundamental for the design of diagnostic molecular tests and to devise effective measures and strategies to mitigate the diffusion of the pandemic.Diverse approaches and sequencing methods can, as testified by the number of available sequences, be applied to SARS-CoV-2 genomes. However, each technology and sequencing approach has its own advantages and limitations. In the current review, we will provide a brief, but hopefully comprehensive, account of currently available platforms and methodological approaches for the sequencing of SARS-CoV-2 genomes. We also present an outline of current repositories and databases that provide access to SARS-CoV-2 genomic data and associated metadata. Finally, we offer general advice and guidelines for the appropriate sharing and deposition of SARS-CoV-2 data and metadata, and suggest that more efficient and standardized integration of current and future SARS-CoV-2-related data would greatly facilitate the struggle against this new pathogen. We hope that our ‘vademecum’ for the production and handling of SARS-CoV-2-related sequencing data, will contribute to this objective.},

 abstract = {The hemoglobin switch from fetal (HbF) to adult (HbA) has been studied intensively as an essential model for gene expression regulation, but also as a beneficial therapeutic approach for β-hemoglobinopathies, towards the objective of reactivating HbF. The transcription factor LRF (Leukemia/lymphoma-related), encoded from the \textit{ZBTB7A} gene has been implicated in fetal hemoglobin silencing, though has a wide range of functions that have not been fully clarified. We thus established the LRF/\textit{ZBTB7A}-overexpressing and \textit{ZBTB7A}-knockdown K562 (human erythroleukemia cell line) clones to assess fetal vs. adult hemoglobin production pre- and post-induction. Transgenic K562 clones were further developed and studied under the influence of epigenetic chromatin regulators, such as DNA methyl transferase 3 (DNMT3) and Histone Deacetylase 1 (HDAC1), to evaluate LRF's potential disturbance upon the aberrant epigenetic background and provide valuable information of the preferable epigenetic frame, in which LRF unfolds its action on the β-type globin's expression. The ChIP-seq analysis demonstrated that LRF binds to γ-globin genes (\textit{HBG2/1}) and apparently associates BCL11A for their silencing, but also during erythropoiesis induction, LRF binds the \textit{BGLT3} gene, promoting \textit{BGLT3}-lncRNA production through the γ-δ intergenic region of β-type globin's locus, triggering the transcriptional events from γ- to β-globin switch. Our findings are supported by an up-to-date looping model, which highlights chromatin alterations during erythropoiesis at late stages of gestation, to establish an "open" chromatin conformation across the γ-δ intergenic region and accomplish β-globin expression and hemoglobin switch.},

Metagenomic sequencing successfully identified complete viral genomes, revealing unique genetic variations. Phylogenetic analysis demonstrated that the EV-A76 strain shares high nucleotide similarity with a recently reported strain from Nepal, distinguishing it from previously identified recombinant strains. The amino acid sequence alignment of the complete EV-A76 genome revealed several distinctive amino acid substitutions compared to the most closely related strains. Notably, variations in the VP1 C-terminus and VP2 EF loop, known for high variability, were observed. These regions, crucial for epitope formation, are particularly susceptible to high-frequency mutations. This study reports the first documented co-infection of EV-A76 and norovirus GI.6[P11] in a single sample, identified through metagenomic sequencing in an AGE case in Thailand in 2023. The observed genetic variations highlight the necessity for ongoing monitoring of viral diversity to strengthen genomic surveillance and inform prevention strategies, especially for emerging pathogens with significant public health implications.},

 abstract = {The unprecedented threats to coral reef ecosystems from global climate change require an urgent response from the aquarium community, which is becoming an increasingly vital coral conservation resource. Unfortunately, many hermatypic corals in aquaria are not identified to species level, which hinders assessment of their conservation significance. Traditional methods of species identification using morphology can be challenging, especially to non-taxonomists. DNA barcoding is an option for species identification of Scleractinian corals, especially when used in concert with morphology-based assessment. This study uses DNA barcodes to try to identify aquarium specimens of the diverse reef-forming genus \textit{Acropora} from 127 samples. We identified to our best current knowledge, to species name 44\% of the analysed samples and provided provisional identification for 80\% of them (101/127, in the form of a list of species names with associate confidence values). We highlighted a sampling bias in public nucleotide sequences repertories (e.g. GenBank) towards more charismatic and more studied species, even inside a well-studied genus like \textit{Acropora}. In addition, we showed a potential "single observer" effect with over a quarter of the reference sequences used for these identifications coming from the same study. We propose the use of barcoding and query matching as an additional tool for taxonomic experts and general aquarists, as an additional tool to increase their chances of making high confidence species-level identifications. We produce a standardised and easily repeatable methodology to increase the capacity of aquariums and other facilities to assess non-ascribed species, emphasising the value of integrating this approach with morphological identification optimising usage of authoritative identification guides and expert opinion.{\textless}h4{\textgreater}Supplementary information{\textless}/h4{\textgreater}The online version contains supplementary material available at 10.1007/s12686-021-01250-3.},

@article{conte_effects_2022,
 abstract = {\textit{Candida} spp. represent the third most frequent worldwide cause of infection in Intensive Care Units with a mortality rate of almost 40\%. The classes of antifungals currently available include azoles, polyenes, echinocandins, pyrimidine derivatives, and allylamines. However, the therapeutical options for the treatment of candidiasis are drastically reduced by the increasing antifungal resistance. The growing need for a more targeted antifungal therapy is limited by the concern of finding molecules that specifically recognize the microbial cell without damaging the host. Epigenetic writers and erasers have emerged as promising targets in different contexts, including the treatment of fungal infections. In \textit{C. albicans}, Hst3p, a sirtuin that deacetylates H3K56ac, represents an attractive antifungal target as it is essential for the fungus viability and virulence. Although the relevance of such epigenetic regulator is documented for the development of new antifungal therapies, the molecular mechanism behind Hst3p-mediated epigenetic regulation remains unrevealed. Here, we provide the first genome-wide profiling of H3K56ac in \textit{C. albicans} resulting in H3K56ac enriched regions associated with \textit{Candida} sp. pathogenicity. Upon Hst3p inhibition, 447 regions gain H3K56ac. Importantly, these genomic areas contain genes encoding for adhesin proteins, degradative enzymes, and white-opaque switching. Moreover, our RNA-seq analysis revealed 1330 upregulated and 1081 downregulated transcripts upon Hst3p inhibition, and among them, we identified 87 genes whose transcriptional increase well correlates with the enrichment of H3K56 acetylation on their promoters, including some well-known regulators of phenotypic switching and virulence. Based on our evidence, Hst3p is an appealing target for the development of new potential antifungal drugs.},

 abstract = {Thraustochytrids are heterotrophic marine protists known for their ability to produce valuable lipids such as docosahexaenoic acid (DHA). However, like many non-model organisms, they present challenges for transcriptomic studies due to the limited reliable reference genomes and compatibility with curated protein databases, complicating the respective assembly and annotation. This study presents a de novo transcriptome assembly and functional annotation for the recently isolated thraustochytrid strain Ulkenia visurgensis Lng2 using solely free access software and code available in public domain repositories. The assembled transcriptome presented 45,867 unique gene models, with a total of 66,623 transcripts and a contig N50 of 3162. Functional annotations highlighted high amounts of transcripts related to the biosynthesis of relevant lipidic molecules, as well as stress-adaptive features including catalytic and xenobiotic degrading activity. Likewise, 2381 transcripts were linked to enzymes with potential biotechnological applications. Notably, several transcripts corresponding to uncommon enzymatic activities in thraustochytrids, including laccases, cellulases, and chitinases, were identified. Additionally, evidence for a potential lactamase activity was found, marking the first report of such activity in thraustochytrids. Overall, this study offers a simple free-access procedural strategy for a de novo transcriptome assembly and functional annotation in non-model organisms. These results provide valuable insights into the biotechnological potential of thraustochytrids, while also expanding the limited transcriptomic data available for these protists. Notably, it represents the first transcriptomic analysis of the Ulkenia genus.},

 abstract = {This study analyzed genomes from various species of the genus, obtained from 
isolates reported in Ecuador between 2020 and 2023, with the aim of exploring their 
genetic diversity and antimicrobial resistance mechanisms. Both local and online 
bioinformatics tools were used for functional annotation with Prokka, genomic 
alignments using Mauve and MAFFT, and the construction of a comparative 
pangenome via Panaroo. Based on metadata associated with each isolate, a 
molecular clock analysis was performed to observe mutation patterns over time. By 
cross-referencing with specialized databases, resistance genes against betalactams, aminoglycosides, quinolones, tetracyclines, and others, were identified 
across multiple species. The results revealed phylogenetic groupings primarily 
driven by taxonomic differences among the strains, although in some cases, clusters 
corresponding to geographic or temporal origin were also observed, suggesting 
potential clonal transmission events. Both conserved and fragmented regions were 
detected in the genomes, attributable to biological differences or variability in 
assembly quality. The integration of automatic annotation, phylogenetic and 
pangenomic analysis, and temporal approaches enabled a comprehensive 
evaluation of the evolution and dissemination of Klebsiella in the country. 
Collectively, these findings represent a valuable contribution to genomic 
surveillance and the control of multidrug-resistant bacterial infections in Ecuador.},

The fungus infects only the flowers of camellias causing serious damage to the plant, particularly from an aesthetic point of view. The disease has been reported in almost all countries where camellia is grown for ornamental purposes, but there are not many studies on the variability of the population of this phytopathogen. The main objective of this study was to contribute to study the level of variability within the Italian population. More than 130 C. camelliae strains were collected from six localities distributed in five Italian regions and identified also based on molecular characterization of the ITS nucleotide sequences. The population variability was assessed by comparing the morphological characters. From a phenological point of view, 11 different colony morphotypes were identified, whose presence/absence and frequency are different in the various locations considered. The study of the taxonomically valid nucleotide sequences to differentiate fungi at the species level confirmed that the strains under study belong to a single species. To further investigate Italian population of C. camelliae we sequenced by a combination of long and short reads technologies the genome of a representative strain. This genome represents a worldwide reference for future C. cameliae diversity and pathogenicity studies.},

The use of integrative phenotype-focused -omics technologies such as proteomics and lipidomics provides an unbiased approach to explore the molecular evolution of the tumor and its associated environment.We assembled a cohort of patient-matched initial (iGBM) and recurrent (rGBM) specimens of resected GBM. Proteome and metabolome composition were determined by mass spectrometry-based techniques. We performed neutrophil-GBM cell coculture experiments to evaluate the behavior of rGBM-enriched proteins in the tumor microenvironment. ELISA-based quantitation of candidate proteins was performed to test the association of their plasma concentrations in iGBM with the onset of recurrence.Proteomic profiles reflect increased immune cell infiltration and extracellular matrix reorganization in rGBM. ASAH1, SYMN, and GPNMB were highly enriched proteins in rGBM. Lipidomics indicates the downregulation of ceramides in rGBM. Cell analyses suggest a role for ASAH1 in neutrophils and its localization in extracellular traps. Plasma concentrations of ASAH1 and SYNM show an association with time to recurrence.We describe the potential importance of ASAH1 in tumor progression and development of rGBM via metabolic rearrangement and showcase the feedback from the tumor microenvironment to plasma proteome profiles. We report the potential of ASAH1 and SYNM as plasma markers of rGBM progression.

The method, was evaluated in salmon samples spiked with fresh, heat and cold stressed, bacterial cultures of Salmonella spp., E. coli O157:H7 and L. monocytogenes, as well as with in-house, and commercial mock communities, doped with Y. enterocolitica and thermotolerant Campylobacter spp. No major deviations from the expected results were obtained, reaching a limit of detection  90\% regardless the bioinformatic pipeline selected and concordance values between 0.9 to 1.0. Taken together, the proposed method allows for simple and reliable implementation of NGS as testing tool to streamline foodborne pathogen detection, and overcoming the typical limitations associated with this technology.},

 abstract = {Our understanding of cell fate decisions in hematopoietic stem cells is incomplete. Here, we show that the transcription factor Helios is highly expressed in murine hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells (HSPCs), where it is required to suppress the separation of the platelet/megakaryocyte lineage from the HSPC pool. Helios acts mainly in quiescent cells, where it directly represses the megakaryocyte gene expression program in cells as early as the stem cell stage. Helios binding promotes chromatin compaction, notably at the regulatory regions of platelet-specific genes recognized by the Gata2 and Runx1 transcriptional activators, implicated in megakaryocyte priming. Helios null HSPCs are biased toward the megakaryocyte lineage at the expense of the lymphoid and partially resemble cells of aging animals. We propose that Helios acts as a guardian of HSPC pluripotency by continuously repressing the megakaryocyte fate, which in turn allows downstream lymphoid priming to take place. These results highlight the importance of negative and positive priming events in lineage commitment.},

Here, we characterize PCI domain-containing 2 (PCID2) protein, a subunit of the transcription and export complex 2 (TREX2) complex, to enforce transcriptional repression and post-transcriptional blocks to HIV-1 gene expression during latency. PCID2 bound the latent HIV-1 LTR (long terminal repeat) and repressed transcription initiation during latency. Depletion of PCID2 remodeled the chromatin landscape at the HIV-1 promoter and resulted in transcriptional activation and latency reversal. Immunoprecipitation coupled to mass spectrometry identified PCID2-interacting proteins to include negative viral RNA (vRNA) splicing regulators, and PCID2 depletion resulted in over-splicing of intron-containing vRNA in cell lines and primary cells obtained from PWH. MCM3AP and DSS1, two other RNA-binding TREX2 complex subunits, also inhibit transcription initiation and vRNA alternative splicing during latency. Thus, PCID2 is a novel HIV-1 latency-promoting factor, which in context of the TREX2 sub-complex PCID2-DSS1-MCM3AP blocks transcription and dysregulates vRNA processing.},

 abstract = {Staphylococcus aureus is a globally significant pathogen associated with severe infections, foodborne illnesses, and animal diseases. Its control has become increasingly challenging due to the spread of antibiotic-resistant strains, highlighting the urgent need for effective alternatives. In this context, bacteriophages have emerged as promising biocontrol agents. This study aimed to characterize the newly isolated Staphylococcus phage CapO46 and evaluate its efficacy in reducing S. aureus in milk. Identified as a new species within the Rosenblumvirus genus, CapO46 exhibited a podovirus-like structure and a small linear dsDNA genome (17,107 bp), with no lysogeny-related, antimicrobial resistance, or virulence genes. Host range assays demonstrated its ability to infect all 31 S. aureus isolates from two different countries and in diverse environmental contexts, achieving high efficiency of plating (EOP {\textgreater} 0.5) in 64.5\% of cases. Kinetic analyses revealed rapid adsorption and a short latent period, with a burst size of approximately 30 PFU/cell. In UHT whole-fat milk, CapO46 achieved a maximum reduction of 7.2 log10 CFU/mL in bacterial load after 12 h, maintaining significant suppression (1.6 log10 CFU/mL) after 48 h. Due to its genetic safety, high infectivity across multiple isolates, and antimicrobial activity in milk, CapO46 can be considered a promising candidate for S. aureus biocontrol applications.},

 abstract = {Cave animals are an excellent model system for studying adaptive evolution. At present, however, little is known about the mechanisms that enable surface colonizers to survive in the challenging environment of caves. One possibility is that these species have the necessary genetic background to respond with plastic changes to the pressures of underground habitats. To gain insight into this process, we conducted a comparative study with the fish species Telestes karsticus, which occurs in a hydrological system consisting of an interconnected stream and a cave. Results showed that T. karsticus resided year-round and spawned in Sušik cave, making it the first known cavefish in the Dinaric Karst. Cave and surface populations differed in morphological and physiological characteristics, as well as in patterns of gene expression without any evidence of genetic divergence. To test whether observed trait differences were plastic or genetic, we placed adult fish from both populations under light/dark or constant dark conditions. Common laboratory conditions erased all morphometric differences between the two morphs, suggesting phenotypic plasticity is driving the divergence of shape and size in wild fish. Lighter pigmentation and increased fat deposition exhibited by cave individuals were also observed in surface fish kept in the dark in the laboratory. Our study also revealed that specialized cave traits were not solely attributed to developmental plasticity, but also arose from adult responses, including acclimatization. Thus, we conclude that T. karsticus can adapt to cave conditions, with phenotypic plasticity playing an important role in the process of cave colonization.},

 abstract = {Recent studies support the assumption that mutation of the X-linked Pig-a gene is most likely responsible for the mutant phenotype of the cells deficient in glycosylphosphatidylinositol (GPI)-anchored proteins quantified in the rodent Pig-a gene mutation assay. In humans, however, mutations in both alleles of one of the 30 other genes involved in GPI-anchor synthesis, e.g., PIG-L and PIG-O, cause reduced expression of surface GPI-anchored proteins. Here, we investigated the possibility that the loss of the GPI-anchor detected by the rat Pig-a assay also could be caused by mutation in other GPI-biosynthesis genes. 31 samples were obtained from 8 inbred and outbred rat strains commonly used for genetic toxicology assays. In order to investigate possible sources of variation in the Pig-a assay, variant DNA sequences were evaluated in Cd59 and 24 GPI-biosynthesis genes. In some genes, such as Pig-n and Pig-u, homozygous variations occurred in all animals, suggesting that these variations are due to deviations in the reference genome. Heterozygous Pig-s, Pig-w, Pig-o, Pig-c, Pgap1, Pgap2, Pig-k and Pig-t variations were found, however, indicating that these genes could serve as targets for mutation in the assay. Protein alignment for these altered genes was conducted with possible human, mouse and rat phenotypic mutants from the literature; this analysis demonstrated that many of the variations that we detected were in non-conserved sequences and that no phenotypes for any of these variants could be inferred from known mutants from the literature. All heterozygous variants were in outbred rats. Overall, the findings of this study cannot totally rule out the possibility that mutations in GPI-biosynthesis genes other than Pig-a are detected in the Pig-a assay, but suggest that if it occurs, it must occur only rarely and therefore mutations in genes other than Pig-a have little impact on rat-based experiments.},

These early mutants were obtained by mutagenesis with chemical agents that introduced dozens to hundreds of mutations in the bacterial genomes. In this work, we present the complete genome sequences of six of these original mutants on ftsA, ftsZ and ftsQ genes, along with two of the strains used to generate them. The genomes of mutants obtained by exposure to nitrosoguanidine had 100 to 400 mutations. Transducing target alleles into a new strain effectively reduced the number of mutations, but those near the target gene were co-transduced with it. In contrast, a mutant generated by site-directed mutagenesis maintained the genomic background intact. The genomic analysis improves our understanding of these foundational strains, offering insights into the effects of historical mutagenesis techniques. These findings underscore the importance of genomic characterization in ensuring accurate interpretations of experimental results in microbiological research.},

Unusually for a single genus, it also includes species that can antagonize \textit{Pythium} plant pathogens, such as \textit{Pythium oligandrum}. We investigated if a new isolate of \textit{P. oligandrum} could antagonize \textit{P. myriotylum}, what changes occurred in gene expression when \textit{P. oligandrum} (antagonist) and \textit{P. myriotylum} (host) interacted, and whether \textit{P. oligandrum} could control soft-rot of ginger caused by \textit{P. myriotylum}. An isolate of \textit{P. oligandrum}, GAQ1, recovered from soil could antagonize \textit{P. myriotylum} in a plate-based confrontation assay whereby \textit{P. myriotylum} became non-viable. The loss of viability of \textit{P. myriotylum} coupled with how \textit{P. oligandrum} hyphae could coil around and penetrate the hyphae of \textit{P. myriotylum}, indicated a predatory interaction. We investigated the transcriptional responses of \textit{P. myriotylum} and \textit{P. oligandrum} using dual-RNAseq at a stage in the confrontation where similar levels of total transcripts were measured from each species. As part of the transcriptional response of \textit{P. myriotylum} to the presence of \textit{P. oligandrum}, genes including a subset of putative Kazal-type protease inhibitors were strongly upregulated along with cellulases, elicitin-like proteins and genes involved in the repair of DNA double-strand breaks. In \textit{P. oligandrum}, proteases, cellulases, and peroxidases featured prominently in the upregulated genes. The upregulation along with constitutive expression of \textit{P. oligandrum} proteases appeared to be responded to by the upregulation of putative protease inhibitors from \textit{P. myriotylum}, suggesting a \textit{P. myriotylum} defensive strategy. Notwithstanding this \textit{P. myriotylum} defensive strategy, \textit{P. oligandrum} had a strong disease control effect on soft-rot of ginger caused by \textit{P. myriotylum}. The newly isolated strain of \textit{P. oligandrum} is a promising biocontrol agent for suppressing the soft-rot of ginger. The dual-RNAseq approach highlights responses of \textit{P. myriotylum} that suggests features of a defensive strategy, and are perhaps another factor that may contribute to the variable success and durability of biological attempts to control diseases caused by \textit{Pythium} spp.},

 abstract = {The \textit{Pythium} (Peronosporales, Oomycota) genus includes devastating plant pathogens that cause widespread diseases and severe crop losses. Here, we have uncovered a far greater arsenal of virulence factor-related genes in the necrotrophic Pythium myriotylum than in other \textit{Pythium} plant pathogens. The genome of a plant-virulent \textit{P. myriotylum} strain ({\textasciitilde}70 Mb and 19,878 genes) isolated from a diseased rhizome of ginger (Zingiber officinale) encodes the largest repertoire of putative effectors, proteases, and plant cell wall-degrading enzymes (PCWDEs) among the studied species. \textit{P. myriotylum} has twice as many predicted secreted proteins than any other \textit{Pythium} plant pathogen. Arrays of tandem duplications appear to be a key factor of the enrichment of the virulence factor-related genes in \textit{P. myriotylum}. The transcriptomic analysis performed on two \textit{P. myriotylum} isolates infecting ginger leaves showed that proteases were a major part of the upregulated genes along with PCWDEs, Nep1-like proteins (NLPs), and elicitin-like proteins. A subset of \textit{P. myriotylum} NLPs were analyzed and found to have necrosis-inducing ability from agroinfiltration of tobacco (Nicotiana benthamiana) leaves. One of the heterologously produced infection-upregulated putative cutinases found in a tandem array showed esterase activity with preferences for longer-chain-length substrates and neutral to alkaline pH levels. Our results allow the development of science-based targets for the management of \textit{P. myriotylum}-caused disease, as insights from the genome and transcriptome show that gene expansion of virulence factor-related genes play a bigger role in the plant parasitism of \textit{Pythium} spp. than previously thought. \textbf{IMPORTANCE} \textit{Pythium} species are oomycetes, an evolutionarily distinct group of filamentous fungus-like stramenopiles. The \textit{Pythium} genus includes several pathogens of important crop species, e.g., the spice ginger. Analysis of our genome from the plant pathogen Pythium myriotylum uncovered a far larger arsenal of virulence factor-related genes than found in other \textit{Pythium} plant pathogens, and these genes contribute to the infection of the plant host. The increase in the number of virulence factor-related genes appears to have occurred through the mechanism of tandem gene duplication events. Genes from particular virulence factor-related categories that were increased in number and switched on during infection of ginger leaves had their activities tested. These genes have toxic activities toward plant cells or activities to hydrolyze polymeric components of the plant. The research suggests targets to better manage diseases caused by \textit{P. myriotylum} and prompts renewed attention to the genomics of \textit{Pythium} plant pathogens.},

Pd2+ exposure significantly increased the observed current via EET, which correlated with substantially increased viable biofilm formation on the electrode. Transcriptomics revealed a coordinated cellular response, including upregulation of genes facilitating EET (the Mtr pathway), metabolism, motility, and biofilm processes, alongside downregulation of competing pathways. Cellular reduction of Pd2+ to palladium nanoparticles, mainly near the outer membrane, was confirmed via microscopy. Pd2+ boosts S. oneidensis MR-1 bioelectrocatalysis through the combined effects of promoting biofilm development and upregulating essential cellular pathways, informing fundamental strategies for enhanced MESs targeted for sustainable engineering, bioremediation, and resource and material recovery applications.},

 abstract = {Skin cancer, particularly melanoma, remains a major public health concern due to its high mortality rate. Current treatment options, including chemotherapy with dacarbazine and doxorubicin, have shown limited efficacy, achieving only a 20\% objective response rate over six months, along with severe side effects such as cardiotoxicity. Given these limitations, there is a growing interest in herbal medicine as a source of novel anticancer compounds. \textit{Bambusa stenostachya}, a bamboo species native to Taiwan, was investigated for its potential anti-melanoma properties using network pharmacology and molecular docking. LC-MS analysis identified seven bioactive compounds, including quinic acid and isovitexin, which satisfied Lipinski's drug-likeness criteria. Among the seven bioactive compounds identified, five belong to the flavonoid family, while two are classified as phenolic compounds that modulate signaling pathways related to cancer and exhibit antioxidant activity, respectively. Through pathway enrichment analysis, four key melanoma-associated genes (PIM1, MEK1, CDK2, and PDK1) were identified as potential therapeutic targets. Ensemble docking results demonstrated that naringin-7-rhamnoglucoside exhibited the highest binding affinity (-6.30 kcal/mol) with phosphoinositide-dependent kinase-1, surpassing the affinities of standard chemotherapeutic agents. Additionally, the average docking scores for naringin-7-rhamnoglucoside and the remaining three proteins were as follows: PIM1 (-5.92), MEK1 (-6.07), and CDK2 (-5.26). These findings suggest that the bioactive compounds in \textit{B. stenostachya} may play a crucial role in inhibiting melanoma progression by modulating metabolic and signaling pathways. Further in vitro and in vivo studies are necessary to validate these computational findings and explore the potential of \textit{B. stenostachya} as a complementary therapeutic agent for melanoma.},

 abstract = {In search of more efficacious and safe pharmacological treatments for atrial fibrillation (AF), atria-selective antiarrhythmic agents have been promoted that target ion channels principally expressed in the atria. This concept allows one to engage antiarrhythmic effects in atria, but spares the ventricles from potentially proarrhythmic side effects. It has been suggested that cardiac small conductance Ca2+-activated K+ (SK) channels may represent an atria-selective target in mammals including humans. However, there are conflicting data concerning the expression of SK channels in different stages of AF, and recent findings suggest that SK channels are upregulated in ventricular myocardium when patients develop heart failure. To address this issue, RNA-sequencing was performed to compare expression levels of three SK channels (KCNN1, KCNN2, and KCNN3) in human atrial and ventricular tissue samples from transplant donor hearts (no cardiac disease), and patients with cardiac disease in sinus rhythm or with AF. In addition, for control purposes expression levels of several genes known to be either chamber-selective or differentially expressed in AF and heart failure were determined. In atria, as compared to ventricle from transplant donor hearts, we confirmed higher expression of KCNN1 and KCNA5, and lower expression of KCNJ2, whereas KCNN2 and KCNN3 were statistically not differentially expressed. Overall expression of KCNN1 was low compared to KCNN2 and KCNN3. Comparing atrial tissue from patients with AF to sinus rhythm samples we saw downregulation of KCNN2 in AF, as previously reported. When comparing ventricular tissue from heart failure patients to non-diseased samples, we found significantly increased ventricular expression of KCNN3 in heart failure, as previously published. The other channels showed no significant difference in expression in either disease. Our results add weight to the view that SK channels are not likely to be an atria-selective target, especially in failing human hearts, and modulators of these channels may prove to have less utility in treating AF than hoped.

This white paper presents a roadmap for future e-infrastructure developments in the field of IDP research within the ELIXIR framework. The goal of these developments is to drive the creation of high-quality tools and resources to support the identification, analysis and functional characterisation of IDPs. The roadmap is the result of a workshop titled “An intrinsically disordered protein user community proposal for ELIXIR” held at the University of Padua. The workshop, and further consultation with the members of the wider IDP community, identified the key priority areas for the roadmap including the development of standards for data annotation, storage and dissemination; integration of IDP data into the ELIXIR Core Data Resources; and the creation of benchmarking criteria for IDP-related software. Here, we discuss these areas of priority, how they can be implemented in cooperation with the ELIXIR platforms, and their connections to existing ELIXIR Communities and international consortia. The article provides a preliminary blueprint for an IDP Community in ELIXIR and is an appeal to identify and involve new stakeholders.},

@article{david_mitigating_2024,
 abstract = {Biofilm-associated candidiasis poses a significant challenge in clinical settings due to the limited effectiveness of existing antifungal treatments. The challenges include increased pathogen virulence, multi-drug resistance, and inadequate penetration of antimicrobials into biofilm structures. One potential solution to this problem involves the development of novel drugs that can modulate fungal virulence and biofilm formation, which is essential for pathogenesis. Resistance in Candida albicans is initiated by morphological changes from yeast to hyphal form. This transition triggers a series of events such as cell wall elongation, increased adhesion, invasion of host tissues, pathogenicity, biofilm formation, and the initiation of an immune response. The cell wall is a critical interface for interactions with host cells, primarily through various cell wall proteins, particularly mannoproteins. Thus, cell wall proteins and enzymes are considered potential antifungal targets. In this regard, we explored α-glucosidase as our potential target which plays a crucial role in processing mannoproteins. Previous studies have shown that inhibition of α-glucosidase leads to defects in cell wall integrity, reduced adhesion, diminished secretion of hydrolytic enzymes, alterations in immune recognition, and reduced pathogenicity. Since α-glucosidase, primarily converts carbohydrates, our study focuses on FDA-approved carbohydrate mimic drugs (Glycomimetics) with well-documented applications in various biological contexts. Through virtual screening of 114 FDA-approved carbohydrate-based drugs, a pseudo-sugar Acarbose, emerged as a top hit. Acarbose is known for its pharmacological potential in managing type 2 diabetes mellitus by targeting α-glucosidase. Our preliminary investigations indicate that Acarbose effectively inhibits C. albicans biofilm formation, reduces virulence, impairs morphological switching, and hinders the adhesion and invasion of host cells, all at very low concentrations in the nanomolar range. Furthermore, transcriptomic analysis reveals the mechanism of action of Acarbose, highlighting its role in targeting α-glucosidase.},

@article{dawson_carbon_2025,
 abstract = {Carbon monoxide (CO) oxidising microorganisms are present in volcanic deposits throughout succession, with levels of vegetation and soil influencing the communities present. Carboxydovores are a subset of CO oxidisers that use CO as an energy source, which raises questions about the physiological and metabolic features that make them more competitive in harsh volcanic ecosystems. To address these questions, samples were taken from volcanic strata formed by eruptions from Calbuco Volcano (Chile) in 2015 (tephra) and 1917 (soil). Two carboxydovore members of the Burkholderiaceae family were isolated for further study to elucidate the benefits of carboxydovory for the survival of these strains in extreme volcanic ecosystems. The isolates were identified as Paraburkholderia terrae COX (isolated from the 2015 tephra) and Cupriavidus str. CV2 (isolated from the 1917 soil). 16S rRNA gene sequencing showed that within the family Burkholderiacea, the genus Paraburkholderia dominated the 2015 volcanic deposit with an average relative abundance of 73.81\%, whereas in the 1917 volcanic deposit, Cupriavidus accounted for 33.64\% (average relative abundance). Both strains oxidise CO across a broad range of concentrations ({\textless} 100 ppmv - 10,000 ppmv), and genome sequence analysis revealed a candidate form-I carbon monoxide dehydrogenase (CODH), which is likely to catalyse this process. Each strain oxidised CO specifically at stationary phase but the conditions for induction of CODH expression were distinct. Cupriavidus strain CV2 expressed CODH only when CO was added to cultures (100 ppm), while Pb. terrae COX expressed CODH regardless of supplementary CO addition. Based on comparative metabolic and phylogenetic analyses, Cupriavidus strain CV2 is proposed as a novel species within the genus Cupriavidus with the name Cupriavidus ulmosensis sp. nov. for the type strain CV2$^{\textrm{T}}$ (= NCIMB 15506$^{\textrm{ T}}$, = CECT 30956$^{\textrm{ T}}$). This study provides valuable insights into the physiology and metabolism of carboxydovores which colonise volcanic ecosystems.},

Here, we describe the isolation of O. hominis from samples collected from a South African birth cohort, creating the first archive of cultured strains of the species from Africa. Sequenced genomes from this archive reveal that South African O. hominis is more similar to Australian strains than those from Southeast Asia, and that it may share genes with other members of the microbiome that are relevant for virulence, colonisation, and antibiotic resistance. Leveraging existing microbiome data from the cohort, O. hominis was found to be closely associated with bacterial co-colonisers that are rare in non-carrier individuals, including Suttonella , Helcococcus , Moraxella spp., and Gracilibacteria. Their collective acquisition has a significant impact on the diversity of nasopharyngeal communities that contain O. hominis . Individuals who have not yet acquired O. hominis have a higher abundance of Moraxella (particularly M. lincolnii ) than individuals who never acquire O. hominis , suggesting that this could be a precursor state for successful colonisation.

 abstract = {Marseilleviruses (MsV) are a group of viruses that compose the Marseilleviridae family within the Nucleocytoviricota phylum. They have been found in different samples, mainly in freshwater. MsV are classically organized into five phylogenetic lineages (A/B/C/D/E), but the current taxonomy does not fully represent all the diversity of the MsV lineages. Here, we describe a novel strain isolated from a Brazilian saltwater sample named Marseillevirus cajuinensis. Based on genomics and phylogenetic analyses, M. cajuinensis exhibits a 380,653-bp genome that encodes 515 open reading frames. Additionally, M. cajuinensis encodes a transfer RNA, a feature that is rarely described for Marseilleviridae. Phylogeny suggests that \textit{M. cajuinensis} forms a divergent branch within the MsV lineage A. Furthermore, our analysis suggests that the common ancestor for the five classical lineages of MsV diversified into three major groups. The organization of MsV into three main groups is reinforced by a comprehensive analysis of clusters of orthologous groups, sequence identities, and evolutionary distances considering several MsV isolates. Taken together, our results highlight the importance of discovering new viruses to expand the knowledge about known viruses that belong to the same lineages or families. This work proposes a new perspective on the \textit{Marseilleviridae} lineages organization that could be helpful to a future update in the taxonomy of the Marseilleviridae family.{\textless}h4{\textgreater}Importance{\textless}/h4{\textgreater}Marseilleviridae is a family of viruses whose members were mostly isolated from freshwater samples.

On the other hand, \textit{M. cajuinensis} encodes a transfer RNA, which is a gene category involved in protein translation that is rarely described in this viral family. Additionally, our phylogenetic analyses suggested the existence of, at least, three major Marseilleviridae groups.

 abstract = {Syagrus coronata (Mart.) Becc. belongs to the Arecaceae family. It is a species native to Brazil of ecological, social, and economic importance. To date, there are few mitochondrial genomes in Arecaceae (Cocos nucifera and Phoenix dactylifera L.), and studies of the mitochondrial genome are essential to understand the evolution of the Arecaceae family. This study reports and compares the newly sequenced genome of S. coronata. Single-end and paired-end reads were used to obtain de novo contigs. The mitochondrial contigs were selected using C. nucifera as a reference and were merged using mate paired-end reads. The mitochondrial genome showed 642,817 bp, circular structure, containing 73 predicted functional genes, including four ribosomal RNA (rRNA) genes, 27 transfer RNA (tRNA) genes, and 42 coding protein genes. Large chloroplast genomic fragments were identified in the mitochondrial genome, and large DNA repetitive fragments were into intergenic space regions. Arecaceae mitochondrial genomes showed partial similarities in size, genome structure, and gene content. However, they exhibited numerous rearrangements. In summary, (1) we sequenced the mitochondrial genome of S. coronata and compared with other mitogenomes of Arecaceae. (2) Genomic rearrangements and gene transfer have been identified from the chloroplast genome to the mitochondrial genome. (3) The mitochondrial genome of Arecareae showed similarities in size, structure, and gene content. (4) The expansion of intergenic space size occurs due to the insertion of genes originating from the nucleus.},

In this work, the protein profile of the apoplast of the {\textless}italic{\textgreater}T. cacao{\textless}/italic{\textgreater} genotypes Catongo, susceptible to WBD, and CCN-51, resistant one, was evaluated. The leaves of {\textless}italic{\textgreater}T. cacao{\textless}/italic{\textgreater} were collected from asymptomatic plants grown in a greenhouse (GH) and from green witches’ brooms grown under field (FD) conditions for extraction of apoplastic washing fluid (AWF). AWF was used in proteomic and enzymatic analysis. A total of 14 proteins were identified in Catongo GH and six in Catongo FD, with two proteins being common, one up-accumulated, and one down-accumulated. In CCN-51, 19 proteins were identified in the GH condition and 13 in FD, with seven proteins being common, one up-accumulated, and six down-accumulated. Most proteins are related to defense and stress in both genotypes, with emphasis on pathogenesis-related proteins (PR): PR-2 (β-1,3-glucanases), PR-3 and PR-4 (chitinases), PR-5 (thaumatine), PR-9 (peroxidases), and PR-14 (lipid transfer proteins). Furthermore, proteins from microorganisms were detected in the AWF. The enzymatic activities of PR-3 showed a significant increase (p \&lt; 0.05) in Catongo GH and PR-2 activity (p \&lt; 0.01) in CCN-51 FD. The protein profile of the {\textless}italic{\textgreater}T. cacao{\textless}/italic{\textgreater} apoplastome offers insight into the defense dynamics that occur in the interaction with the fungus {\textless}italic{\textgreater}M. perniciosa{\textless}/italic{\textgreater} and offers new insights in exploring future WBD control strategies.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

In this work, the aim was to isolate AMP-producing ruminal streptococci and to characterize their genetic features through whole-genome sequencing. We cultured 463 bacterial isolates from the rumen of Nelore bulls, 81 of which were phenotypically classified as being \textit{Streptococcaceae}. Five isolates with broad-range activity were genome sequenced and confirmed as being \textit{Streptococcus lutetiensis}. The genetic features linked to their antimicrobial activity or adaptation to the rumen environment were characterized through comparative genomics. The genome of \textit{S. lutetiensis} UFV80 harbored a putative CRISPR-Cas9 system (Type IIA). Computational tools were used to discover novel biosynthetic clusters linked to the production of bacteriocins. All bacterial genomes harbored genetic clusters related to the biosynthesis of class I and class II bacteriocins. SDS-PAGE confirmed the results obtained in silico and demonstrated that the class II bacteriocins predicted in the genomes of three \textit{S. lutetiensis} strains had identical molecular mass (5197 Da). These results demonstrate that ruminal bacteria of the \textit{Streptococcus bovis}/\textit{equinus} complex represent a promising source of novel antimicrobial peptides.},

Here, I report the identification and characterization of novel viruses detected in public RNAseq datasets of South American long-haired and olive field mice. The divergent viruses dubbed Ratón oliváceo morbillivirus (RoMV) detected in renal samples from mice collected from Chile and Argentina are characterized by an unusually large genome including long intergenic regions and the presence of an accessory protein between the F and H genes redounding in a genome architecture consisting in 3'-N-P/V/C-M-F-hp-H-L-5'. Structural and functional annotation, genetic distance, and evolutionary insights suggest that RoMV is a member of a novel species within genus \textit{Morbillivirus} tentatively named as South American mouse morbillivirus.

 abstract = {BACKGROUND:
Clonal hematopoiesis of indeterminate potential (CHIP) is an acquired genetic risk factor for both leukemia and cardiovascular disease. It results in proinflammatory myeloid cells in the bone marrow and blood; however, how these cells behave in the cardiovascular tissue remains unclear. Our study aimed at investigating whether CHIP-mutated macrophages accumulate preferentially in cardiovascular tissues and examining the transcriptome of tissue macrophages from DNMT3A (DNA methyltransferase 3 alpha) or TET2 (Tet methylcytosine dioxygenase 2) mutation carriers.
METHODS:
We recruited patients undergoing carotid endarterectomy or heart surgeries to screen for CHIP mutation carriers using targeted genomic sequencing. Myeloid and lymphoid cells were isolated from blood and cardiovascular tissue collected during surgeries using flow cytometry. DNA and RNA extracted from these sorted cells were subjected to variant allele frequency measurement using droplet digital polymerase chain reaction and transcriptomic profiling using bulk RNA sequencing, respectively.
RESULTS:
Using droplet digital polymerase chain reaction, we detected similar variant allele frequency of CHIP in monocytes from blood and macrophages from atheromas and heart tissues, even among heart macrophages with and without CCR2 (C-C motif chemokine receptor 2) expression. Bulk RNA sequencing revealed a proinflammatory gene profile of myeloid cells from DNMT3A or TET2 mutation carriers compared with those from noncarriers.
CONCLUSIONS:
Quantitatively, CHIP-mutated myeloid cells did not preferentially accumulate in cardiovascular tissues, but qualitatively, they expressed a more disease-prone phenotype.},

@article{dehghanian_zfp982_2024,
 abstract = {Background
Understanding the genetic underpinnings of protein networks conferring stemness is of broad interest for basic and translational research.
Methods
We used multi-omics analyses to identify and characterize stemness genes, and focused on the zinc finger protein 982 (Zfp982) that regulates stemness through the expression of Nanog, Zfp42, and Dppa3 in mouse embryonic stem cells (mESC).
Results
Zfp982 was expressed in stem cells, and bound to chromatin through a GCAGAGKC motif, for example near the stemness genes Nanog, Zfp42, and Dppa3. Nanog and Zfp42 were direct targets of ZFP982 that decreased in expression upon knockdown and increased upon overexpression of Zfp982. We show that ZFP982 expression strongly correlated with stem cell characteristics, both on the transcriptional and morphological levels. Zfp982 expression decreased with progressive differentiation into ecto-, endo- and mesodermal cell lineages, and knockdown of Zfp982 correlated with morphological and transcriptional features of differentiated cells. Zfp982 showed transcriptional overlap with members of the Hippo signaling pathway, one of which was Yap1, the major co-activator of Hippo signaling. Despite the observation that ZFP982 and YAP1 interacted and localized predominantly to the cytoplasm upon differentiation, the localization of YAP1 was not influenced by ZFP982 localization.
Conclusions
Together, our study identified ZFP982 as a transcriptional regulator of early stemness genes, and since ZFP982 is under the control of the Hippo pathway, underscored the importance of the context-dependent Hippo signals for stem cell characteristics.},

@article{delaleau_comprehensive_2025,
 abstract = {Recent evidence indicates that the bacterial Rho helicase regulates Bacillus subtilis gene expression in a growth-dependent manner. This regulation, along with extensive in vivo trimming of Rho-dependent transcript 3′-ends, complicates the identification of Rho-dependent transcription terminators using standard transcriptomic approaches. To overcome this challenge, we applied Helicase-SELEX to precisely map Rho utilization (Rut) sites genome-wide. Using B. subtilis Rho (BsRho), we identified 600 putative Rut sites, while the more permissive Escherichia coli Rho (EcRho) revealed 4189 sites, including specimens known to regulate B. subtilis genes. Comparative analysis showed that both enzymes recognize similar pyrimidine-rich sequences, though BsRho favors short unstructured Rut motifs whereas EcRho can act on presumably more structured RNAs without requiring accessory factors. In vivo validation of selected Rut sites confirmed Rho-dependent regulation and extensive PNPase-mediated processing of Rho-terminated transcripts. Collectively, our results reveal a rich and complex Rho-dependent regulatory network in B. subtilis, encompassing the widespread control of antisense transcription and genes/operons of both primary and secondary metabolism. Although nonessential under standard laboratory conditions, Rho thus likely contributes to B. subtilis fitness and survival in more demanding environments. Our comprehensive compendium of Rut sites offers a valuable resource for exploring this adaptive regulatory landscape.},

Two clones of P. falciparum (Pf3D7 and PfW2) were sequenced in long-read using the PromethION sequencer from Oxford Nanopore Technologies without genomic amplification. This made it possible to create a processing analysis pipeline for human Plasmodium with ONT Fastq only. De novo assembly revealed N50 lengths of 18,488 kb and 17,502 kb for the Pf3D7 and PfW2, respectively. The genome size was estimated at 23,235,407 base pairs for the Pf3D7 clone and 21,712,038 base pairs for the PfW2 clone. The average genome coverage depth was estimated at 787X and 653X for the Pf3D7 and PfW2 clones, respectively. This study proposes an assembly processing pipeline for the human Plasmodium genome using software adapted to large ONT data and the high AT percentage of Plasmodium. This search provides all the parameters which were optimized for use with the software selected in the pipeline.},

 abstract = {Plasmacytoid dendritic cells (pDCs) are a unique subset of dendritic cells specialized in rapid and robust type I interferon (IFN) production, playing critical roles in the pathogenesis and pathomechanisms of many human diseases. Accurate identification of pDCs in peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) is challenging due to dynamic and non-exclusive specific expression of surface markers such as blood dendritic cell antigen (BDCA)-2 and BDCA-4. Although BDCA-4 is generally more stably expressed than BDCA-2, prolonged stimulation or inflammatory conditions can induce its expression on multiple non-pDC cell types, reducing the accuracy of pDC identification. Here, we thoroughly investigated BDCA-4 expression dynamics on pDCs and other PBMC subsets following prolonged activation with Toll-like receptor (TLR) 7 and TLR9 agonists. Our flow cytometry analysis revealed a significant increase in BDCA-4-positive non-pDC populations after extended stimulation, primarily corresponding to CD14+ monocytes. To overcome this limitation, we performed a gating strategy combining BDCA-4 positivity with a cocktail of non-pDC markers, enabling the exclusion of non-pDCs and accurate identification of pDCs. This approach enables the reliable identification of pDCs within heterogeneous cell populations using only two fluorescent channels in healthy conditions and even during strong activation or pathological states characterized by chronic inflammation.},

We used this dataset to explore mechanisms of transcriptional regulation in cardiovascular disease and compared six different experimental models of heart failure, hypertension, or diabetes. Enhancers that regulate gene expression in diseased endothelial cells were enriched with binding sites for a distinct set of transcription factors, including the mineralocorticoid receptor (MR), a known drug target in heart failure and hypertension. For proof of concept, we applied endothelial cell-specific MR deletion in mice to confirm MR-dependent gene expression and predicted direct MR target genes.

To test their suitability for transcriptomic or epigenetic studies, we compared the transcriptome of cultured immortalized mouse cardiac endothelial cells (MCEC) to primary cardiac endothelial cells (pEC). Whole transcriptome comparison of MCEC and pEC showed a correlation of 0.75–0.77. Interestingly, correlation of gene expression declined in endothelial cell-typical genes. In MCEC, we found a broad downregulation of genes that are highly expressed in pEC, including well-described markers of endothelial cell differentiation. Accordingly, systematic analysis revealed a downregulation of genes associated with typical endothelial cell functions in MCEC, while genes related to mitotic cell cycle were upregulated when compared to pEC. In conclusion, the findings from this study suggest that primary cardiac endothelial cells should preferably be used for genome-wide transcriptome or epigenome studies. The suitability of in vitro cell lines for experiments investigating single genes or signaling pathways should be carefully validated before use.},

 abstract = {Performing saturation editing of chromosomal genes will enable the study of genetic variants in situ and facilitate protein and cell engineering. However, current in vivo editing of endogenous genes either lacks flexibility or is limited to discrete codons and short gene fragments, preventing a comprehensive exploration of genotype-phenotype relationships. To enable facile saturation editing of full-length genes, we used a protospacer adjacent motif–relaxed Cas9 variant and homology-directed repair to achieve above 60\% user-defined codon replacement efficiencies in Saccharomyces cerevisiae genome. Coupled with massively parallel DNA design and synthesis, we developed a saturation gene editing method termed CRISPR-Cas9– and homology-directed repair–assisted saturation editing (CHASE) and achieved highly saturated codon swapping of long genomic regions. By applying CHASE to massively edit a well-studied global transcription factor gene, we found known and unreported genetic variants affecting an industrially relevant microbial trait. The user-defined codon editing capability and wide targeting windows of CHASE substantially expand the scope of saturation gene editing.},

 abstract = {Abstract* Azadirachta excelsa (Jack) Jacobs, Kayu bawang (Meliaceae) is economically valuable and widely used by the local community in Bengkulu (Sumatra) as carpentry and construction wood because of its good durability class. However, it still has ambiguous scientific multiple names, such as Azadirachta excelsa , Protium javanicum , and Dysoxylum mollissimum. Additional tools such as molecular approaches can be used to verify whether it is true or not that Kayu bawang is scientifically named as Azadirachta excelsa based on previous morphological identification. This study aimed to construct draft chloroplast genome and verify the scientific name based on molecular identification using a single rbc L gene marker. Genomic DNA was extracted from bark cambium originated from three different provenances in Bengkulu, Indonesia, namely TBT-A, TBT-K, and TBT-S. MinION from Oxford Nanopore Technologies was used to sequence the samples following manufacture protocols SQK-LSK109 yielding 481.6 Mb for TBT-A, 597.4 Mb for TBT-K, and 853.1 Mb for TBT-S, respectively. Generated data were assembled and constructed, namely 58,780 bp (14 tRNAs and 47 encoding genes) for TBT-A, 142,139 bp (4 rRNAs, 24 tRNAs, and 78 encoding genes) for TBT-K, and 84,906 bp (24 tRNAs and 53 encoding genes) for TBT-S. Based on the phylogenetic tree, Azadirachta excelsa from three identified tree stands were placed in the same group with other Azadirachta excelsa accessions.},

 abstract = {Drought is a major stressor to soil microbial communities, and the intensification of climate change is predicted to increase hydric stress worldwide in the coming decades. As a possible mitigating factor for the consequences of prolonged drought periods, above and belowground biodiversity can increase ecosystem resistance and resilience by improving metabolic redundancy and complementarity as biodiversity increases. Here, we investigated the interaction effect between plant richness and successive, simulated summer drought on soil microbial communities during a period of 9 years.To do that, we made use of a well-established biodiversity experiment (The Jena Experiment) to investigate the response of microbial richness and community composition to successive drought periods alongside a plant richness gradient, which covers 1-, 2-, 4-, 8-, 16-, and 60-species plant communities. Plots were covered from natural precipitation by installing rain shelters 6 weeks every summer. Bulk soil samples were collected 1 year after the last summer drought was simulated. Our data indicate that bacterial richness increased after successive exposure to drought, with the increase being stable along the plant richness gradient. We identified a significant effect of plant species richness on the soil microbial community composition and determined the taxa significantly impacted by drought at each plant richness level. Our data successfully demonstrates that summer drought might have a legacy effect on soil bacterial communities.},

Nonstop mutations have been characterized in hereditary diseases, but not in cancer genetics. In a pan-cancer analysis, we curated and analysed 3,412 nonstop mutations from 62 tumour entities, generating a comprehensive database at http://NonStopDB.dkfz.de. Six different nonstop extension mutations affected the tumour suppressor SMAD4, extending its carboxy terminus by 40 amino acids. These caused rapid degradation of the SMAD4 mutants via the ubiquitin–proteasome system. A hydrophobic degron signal sequence of ten amino acids within the carboxy-terminal extension was required to induce complete loss of the SMAD4 protein. Thus, we discovered that nonstop mutations can be functionally important in cancer and characterize their loss-of-function impact on the tumour suppressor SMAD4.},

We collected formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded (FFPE) specimens of paired APA and concurrent aldosterone-producing cell clusters (APCCs) (n = 6).DNA methylation levels were evaluated by quantitative bisulfite next-generation sequencing in fresh-frozen tissues (CYP11A1, CYP11B1, CYP11B2, CYP17A1, CYP21A2, HSD3B1, HSD3B2, NR5A1, STAR, and TSPO) and FFPE APA/APCC paired samples (CYP11B2). CYP11B1, CYP11B2, CYP17, CYP21, and STAR gene expressions were examined by quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction.The main outcome measure was DNA methylation.CYP11B2 methylation levels were significantly lower in APA than in other adrenal tissues (P \&lt; .001). Methylation levels of the remaining genes were comparable among groups. Overall, CYP11B2 expression and DNA methylation were negatively correlated (ρ = –0.379; P = .003). In FFPE-paired APA/APCC samples, CYP11B2 methylation level was significantly lower in APA than in concurrent APCCs (P = .028).DNA methylation plays a regulatory role for CYP11B2 expression and may contribute to aldosterone hypersecretion in APA. Lower CYP11B2 methylation levels in APA than in APCCs may suggest an APCC-to-APA switch via progressive CYP11B2 demethylation. Conversely, DNA methylation seems not to be relevant in regulating the expression of genes encoding steroidogenic enzymes other than CYP11B2.},

 abstract = {Sheep farming represents an important type of extensive livestock farming in Croatia. Studying the genetic variability of sheep is becoming increasingly crucial, especially considering the small effective population sizes of our indigenous sheep breeds. These small populations can result in reduced genetic diversity, which may increase the risk of negative genetic anomalies and reduce the herd's resistance to diseases or other environmental stressors. This study, for the first time, analyzed gender variability at the molecular level by examining the entire mitogenome of 23 individuals representing eight indigenous sheep breeds (Cres Island sheep, Dalmatian Pramenka sheep, Dubrovnik Ruda sheep, Istrian sheep, Krk sheep, Lika sheep, Pag sheep, and Rab sheep) and two mouflons from Croatia. Using bioinformatics tools, mitogenomes with an average coverage depth of 1626 were extracted from the whole genomes of sheep and mouflons at 12x coverage, and mitogenomes with an average coverage depth of 1851 were extracted from genomes at 30x coverage. The fasta set of 25 mitogenomes, with a length of 16616 bp, consisted of 247 singletons and 112 parsimony-informative sites, comprising 24 haplotypes with a haplotype diversity of 0.997. This provided valuable information about high genetic diversity both within and between our sheep breeds and mouflons. For a more detailed phylogenetic and phylogeographic analysis of the mitogenomes, these 25 mitogenomes were analyzed alongside an additional 348 mitogenomes from various sheep breeds worldwide from the GenBank repository. The median-joining network revealed that all haplotypes of our indigenous sheep breeds and Croatian mouflons belong to haplogroup B. Interestingly, one Krk sheep haplotype belonged to haplogroup A, and one Dubrovnik Ruda sheep haplotype belonged to haplogroup C. Bayesian-based Beast phylogenetic analysis also confirmed the membership of these haplotypes in haplogroups A, B, and C, with posterior probabilities of 1 for the branching of these haplogroups. The phylogeographic distribution of haplogroups confirmed a high frequency of haplogroup A in breeds from Central and Eastern Asia, and a high frequency of haplogroup B in Europe and Anatolia. Rare haplogroups C were found in the Pyrenees, the Middle East, the Caspian Sea region, China, India, and Nepal, while haplogroups D and E were present in the Middle East. The haplotypes of our mouflons were grouped into haplogroup B, along with other European mouflons. The presence of two haplotypes attributed to haplogroups A and C suggests migratory contacts between the Balkans and the Middle East, which require further investigation.},

@article{diz-kucukkaya_jak2v617f_2024,
 abstract = {OBJECTIVE: It has been shown that clonal mutations occur in hematopoietic stem cells with advancing age and increase the risk of death due to atherosclerotic vascular diseases, similarly to myeloproliferative neoplasms. Endothelial cells (ECs) and hematopoietic stem cells develop from common stem cells called hemangioblasts in the early embryonic period. However, the presence of hemangioblasts in the postnatal period is controversial. In this study, JAK2 gene variants were examined in patients with atherosclerotic carotid disease and without any hematological malignancies.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: Ten consecutive patients (8 men and 2 women) with symptomatic atherosclerotic carotid stenosis were included in this study. ECs (CD31+CD45-) were separated from tissue samples taken by carotid endarterectomy. JAK2 variants were examined in ECs, peripheral blood mononuclear cells, and oral epithelial cells of the patients with next-generation sequencing.
RESULTS: The median age of the patients was 74 (range: 58-80) years and the median body mass index value was 24.44 (range: 18.42-30.85) kg/m2. Smoking history was present in 50\%, hypertension in 80\%, diabetes in 70\%, and ischemic heart disease in 70\% of the cases. The JAK2V617F mutation was detected in the peripheral blood mononuclear cells of 3 of the 10 patients, and 2 patients also had the JAK2V617F mutation in their ECs. The JAK2V617F mutation was not found in the oral epithelial cells of any of the patients.
CONCLUSION: In this study, for the first time in the literature, we showed that the JAK2V617F mutation was found somatically in both peripheral blood cells and ECs in patients with atherosclerosis. This finding may support that ECs and hematopoietic cells originate from a common clone or that somatic mutations can be transmitted to ECs by other mechanisms. Examining the molecular and functional changes caused by the JAK2V617F mutation in ECs may help open a new avenue for treating atherosclerosis.},

 abstract = {Necrosis- and ethylene-inducing proteins are effector molecules of microorganisms able to induce cell death in plant tissues and/or ethylene biosynthesis. The fungus Moniliophthora perniciosa, which causes the witches' broom disease in Theobroma cacao, contains five genes that encode these proteins (MpNep1-5) in its genome. Among these, MpNep2 is the most expressed Nep during disease's development, especially in the necrotic phase. Although widely studied, little is known about the mechanisms by which these proteins induce cell death. In this perspective, the present study aimed to identify potential MpNEP2 target proteins in protein extracts of Theobroma cacao (genotype Catongo) and propose, from the results achieved, mechanisms by which MpNEP2 can induce the process of cell death. Molecular targets captured in vitro by rMpNEP2 immobilized on CNBr-Sepharose were identified by ms/ms. Candidate targets were identified as an Auxin Response Factor, Sphingosine Kinase and a Formin like protein. These proteins are known to participate in important processes in primary metabolism, molecular function and regulation of the plant's response. The targets:MpNEP2 interactions were validated in silico. We discussed the different signaling pathways, membrane modulation and cell cytoskeleton, by which MpNEP2 can act and induce responses in the plant that leads to necrosis.},

To address these problems, we present an integrated bioinformatics workflow for mass spectrometry-based metaproteomics that combines custom protein sequence database generation, peptide-spectrum match generation and verification, quantification, taxonomic and functional annotations, and statistical analysis. This workflow also offers characterization of human proteins (while prioritizing microbial proteins), thus offering insights into host-microbe dynamics in disease. The tools and workflow are deployed in the Galaxy ecosystem, enabling the development, optimization, and dissemination of these computational resources. We have applied this workflow for metaproteomic analysis of numerous clinical sample types, such as nasopharyngeal swabs and bronchoalveolar lavage fluid. Here, we demonstrate its utility via the analysis of residual fluid from cervical swabs. The complete workflow and accompanying training resources are accessible on the Galaxy Training Network to equip non-experts and experienced researchers with the necessary knowledge and tools to analyze their data.},

 abstract = {Influenza type A virus (IAV) infection is a major cause of morbidity and mortality during influenza epidemics. Recently, a specific link between IAV infection and neurodegenerative disease progression has been established. The non-structural NS1 protein of IAV regulates viral replication during infection and antagonizes host antiviral responses, contributing to influenza virulence. In the present study, we have prepared a mouse lung-to-lung adapted to the NS1-truncated virus (NS80ad). Transcriptome analysis of the gene expression in the lungs revealed that infection with wild-type A/WSN/33 (WSN), NS80, and NS80ad viruses resulted in different regulation of genes involved in signaling pathways associated with the cell proliferation, inflammatory response, and development of neurodegenerative diseases. NS1 protein did not influence the genes involved in the RIG-I-like receptor signaling pathway in the brains. Lethal infection with IAVs dysregulated expression of proteins associated with the development of neurodegenerative diseases (CX3CL1/Fractalkine, Coagulation factor III, and CD105/Endoglin, CD54/ICAM-1, insulin-like growth factor-binding protein (IGFBP)-2, IGFBP-5, IGFBP-6, chitinase 3-like 1 (CHI3L1), Myeloperoxidase (MPO), Osteopontin (OPN), cystatin C, and LDL R). Transcription of GATA3 mRNA was decreased, and expression of MPO was inhibited in the brain infected with NS80 and NS80ad viruses. In addition, the truncation of NS1 protein led to reduced expression of IGFBP-2, CHI3L1, MPO, and LDL-R proteins in the brains. Our results indicate that the influenza virus influences the expression of proteins involved in brain function, and this might occur mostly through the NS1 protein. These findings suggest that the abovementioned proteins represent a promising target for the development of potentially effective immunotherapy against neurodegeneration.},

 abstract = {Pancreatic adenocarcinoma (PDAC) is one of the major causes of cancer-associated deaths worldwide, with a dismal prognosis that has not significantly changed over the last decades. Transcriptional analysis has provided valuable insights into pancreatic tumorigenesis. Specifically, pancreatic cancer subtypes were identified, characterized by specific mutations and gene expression changes associated with differences in patient survival. In addition to differentially regulated mRNAs, non-coding RNAs, including long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs), were shown to have subtype-specific expression patterns. Hence, we aimed to characterize prognostic lncRNAs with deregulated expression in the squamous subtype of PDAC, which has the worst prognosis. Extensive in silico analyses followed by in vitro experiments identified long intergenic non-coding RNA 261 (LINC00261) as a downregulated lncRNA in the squamous subtype of PDAC, which is generally associated with transforming growth factor \&beta; (TGF\&beta;) signaling in human cancer cells. Its genomic neighbor, the transcription factor forkhead box protein A2 (FOXA2), regulated LINC00261 expression by direct binding of the LINC00261 promoter. CRISPR-mediated knockdown and promoter knockout validated the importance of LINC00261 in TGF\&beta;-mediated epithelial\&ndash;mesenchymal transition (EMT) and established the epithelial marker E-cadherin, an important cell adhesion protein, as a downstream target of LINC00261. Consequently, depletion of LINC00261 enhanced motility and invasiveness of PANC-1 cells in vitro. Altogether, our data suggest that LINC00261 is an important tumor-suppressive lncRNA in PDAC that is involved in maintaining a pro-epithelial state associated with favorable disease outcome.},

 abstract = {Many organisms evolved strategies to survive desiccation. Plant seeds protect dehydrated embryos from various stressors and can lay dormant for millennia. Hydration is the key trigger to initiate germination, but the mechanism by which seeds sense water remains unresolved. We identified an uncharacterized Arabidopsis thaliana prion-like protein we named FLOE1, which phase separates upon hydration and allows the embryo to sense water stress. We demonstrate that biophysical states of FLOE1 condensates modulate its biological function in vivo in suppressing seed germination under unfavorable environments. We find intragenic, intraspecific, and interspecific natural variation in FLOE1 expression and phase separation and show that intragenic variation is associated with adaptive germination strategies in natural populations. This combination of molecular, organismal, and ecological studies uncovers FLOE1 as a tunable environmental sensor with direct implications for the design of drought-resistant crops, in the face of climate change.},

 abstract = {The DNA methyltransferase DNMT3C appeared as a duplication of the DNMT3B gene in muroids and is required for silencing of young retrotransposons in the male germline. Using specialized assay systems, we investigate the flanking sequence preferences of DNMT3C and observe characteristic preferences for cytosine at the -2 and -1 flank that are unique among DNMT3 enzymes. We identify two amino acids in the catalytic domain of DNMT3C (C543 and V547) that are responsible for the DNMT3C-specific flanking sequence preferences and evolutionary conserved in muroids. Reanalysis of published data shows that DNMT3C flanking preferences are consistent with genome-wide methylation patterns in mouse ES cells only expressing DNMT3C. Strikingly, we show that CpG sites with the preferred flanking sequences of DNMT3C are enriched in murine retrotransposons that were previously identified as DNMT3C targets. Finally, we demonstrate experimentally that DNMT3C has elevated methylation activity on substrates derived from these biological targets. Our data show that DNMT3C flanking sequence preferences match the sequences of young murine retrotransposons which facilitates their methylation. By this, our data provide mechanistic insights into the molecular co-evolution of repeat elements and (epi)genetic defense systems dedicated to maintain genomic stability in mammals.},

 abstract = {Migration is a widely observed phenomenon supported by morphological, physiological and behavioural traits that vary with season and sex in many species. Recently, the genetic components underpinning migration in the marmalade hoverfly (Diptera: Syrphidae) have been unpacked through detection of differentially expressed genes between migrant and non-migrant females. Males also migrate, but changing sex ratios during autumn migration, from around 50\% female in northern Europe to around 90\% in southern Europe, suggests males are poor long-distance fliers. To elucidate the mechanisms underpinning this sex difference, we performed morphological, physiological and transcriptomic characterization of actively migrating females and males. Both sexes show similar physiological adaptations including hyperphagia and starvation resistance, but females display higher tolerance to cold, have lower wing loading values and display a greater flight capacity. In addition, females modulate the expression of genes involved in immunity, hypoxia and longevity while suppressing hormonal pathways involved in maintaining reproductive diapause. These traits contribute to the success of female migrants and underlie the diminishing pool of males, influencing population dynamics across huge geographic areas and through the whole migratory and overwintering period.},

It is a foodborne pathogen associated with diarrhea in humans and skin ulceration in fish. In this study, we used whole genome sequencing to profile all antimicrobial resistance (AMR) and virulence genes found in \textit{A}. \textit{media} strain SD/21-15 isolated from marine sediments in Denmark. To gain a better understanding of virulence and AMR genes found in several \textit{A}. \textit{media} strains, we included 24 whole genomes retrieved from the public databanks whose isolates originate from different host species and environmental samples from Asia, Europe, and North America. We also compared the virulence genes of strain SD/21-15 with \textit{A}. \textit{hydrophila}, \textit{A}. \textit{veronii}, and \textit{A}. \textit{salmonicida} reference strains. We detected \textit{Msh} pili, tap IV pili, and lateral flagella genes responsible for expression of motility and adherence proteins in all isolates. We also found \textit{hylA}, \textit{hylIII}, and \textit{TSH} hemolysin genes in all isolates responsible for virulence in all isolates while the \textit{aerA} gene was not detected in all \textit{A}. \textit{media} isolates but was present in \textit{A}. \textit{hydrophila, A}. \textit{veronii}, and \textit{A}. \textit{salmonicida} reference strains. In addition, we detected \textit{LuxS} and \textit{mshA-Q} responsible for quorum sensing and biofilm formation as well as the ferric uptake regulator (\textit{Fur}), heme and siderophore genes responsible for iron acquisition in all \textit{A}. \textit{media} isolates. As for the secretory systems, we found all genes that form the T2SS in all isolates while only the \textit{vgrG1}, \textit{vrgG3}, \textit{hcp}, and \textit{ats} genes that form parts of the T6SS were detected in some isolates. Presence of \textit{bla} $_{\textrm{MOX-9}}$ and \textit{bla} $_{\textrm{OXA-427}}$ β-lactamases as well as \textit{crp} and \textit{mcr} genes in all isolates is suggestive that these genes were intrinsically encoded in the genomes of all \textit{A}. \textit{media} isolates. Finally, the presence of various transposases, integrases, recombinases, virulence, and AMR genes in the plasmids examined in this study is suggestive that \textit{A}. \textit{media} has the potential to transfer virulence and AMR genes to other bacteria. Overall, we anticipate these data will pave way for further studies on virulence mechanisms and the role of \textit{A}. \textit{media} in the spread of AMR genes.},

 abstract = {Biodiversity and its associated genetic diversity are being lost at an unprecedented rate. Simultaneously, the distributions of flora, fauna, fungi, microbes and pathogens are rapidly changing. Novel ways to capture and record genetic diversity before it is lost, and to measure population shifts and pathogen distributions are urgently required. Here we report the rapid application of shotgun long-read environmental DNA (eDNA) analysis for non-invasive biodiversity, genetic diversity and pathogen assessments from air. We also compared air eDNA with water and soil eDNA. Coupling long-read sequencing with established cloud-based biodiversity pipelines enabled a two-day turnaround from airborne sample collection to completed analysis, by a single investigator. To determine the full utility of airborne eDNA, we also conducted a local bioinformatic analysis and deep short-read shotgun sequencing. From outdoor air eDNA alone, comprehensive genetic analysis was performed including population genetics (phylogenetic placement) of a charismatic mammal (bobcat, Lynx rufus), and a venomous spider (golden silk orb weaver, Trichonephila clavipes), and haplotyping humans (Homo sapiens), from natural complex community settings, such as sub-tropical forests and temperate locations. The rich datasets also enabled deeper analysis of specific species and genomic regions of interest, including viral variant calling, human variant analysis, and antimicrobial resistance gene surveillance from airborne DNA. Our results highlight the speed, versatility, and specificity of pan-biodiversity monitoring via non-invasive eDNA sampling using current benchtop/portable and cloud-based approaches. Furthermore, they reveal the future feasibility of scaling down (equipment and temporally) these approaches for near real-time analysis. Together these approaches can enable rapid lifeform and genetic diversity detection from air, water, and sediment samples for unbiased non-targeted information-rich genomics-empowered i) biodiversity monitoring, ii) population genetics, iii) pathogen and disease vector genomic surveillance, iv) allergen and narcotic surveillance, v) antimicrobial resistance surveillance and vi) bioprospecting.},

Blood samples were tested for HBV serological markers (HBsAg, anti-HBc, and anti-HBs) and screened using nested PCR. Whole genome sequencing was conducted on PCR-positive samples to identify HBV genotypes and subgenotypes. \&lt;b\&gt;Results:\&lt;/b\&gt; The overall HBV prevalence among HD patients was 3.75\%, comprising 1.9\% with overt infection (HBsAg +ve) and 1.9\% with occult HBV infection (OBI). HCV was detected in 1.9\% of patients. Evidence of past exposure (anti-HBc positive) was observed in 20\% of patients, and 45\% showed serological immunity with anti-HBs levels ≥ 10 IU/mL. Although the values of the genetic diversity estimators such as K, S, \&lt;i\&gt;η\&lt;/i\&gt;, and \&lt;i\&gt;π\&lt;/i\&gt; were approximately as twice as those for the S-region, the S-region produced a more reasonable phylogenetic tree and haplotype networking but under the condition of accurate sequencing and adequate number of investigated sequences. Phylogenetic trees and haplotype networking of the WGS and S-region revealed a clustering pattern based on genotypes and subgenotypes with two Palestinian WGS clustering in Subgenotype D1, while the other two in Subgenotype D3. Genetic diversity analysis revealed high haplotype diversity (Hd) (0.98-1.00) with high h:n ratio (0.9-1.00) and low nucleotide diversity (\&lt;i\&gt;π\&lt;/i\&gt;) (0.007-0.027) indicating slight variation between any two given sequences. This is explained by purifying selection, recent population expansion, or constrained evolution as neutrality test values such as Tajima's D were negative (-0.5 to -1.86). \&lt;b\&gt;Conclusion:\&lt;/b\&gt; HBV infection remains prevalent among HD patients, including both overt and occult forms. Genotype \&lt;i\&gt;D\&lt;/i\&gt;, specifically Subgenotypes D1 and D3, predominates in the study population. The HBV S-region is a sufficient surrogate for population genetics investigations.},

 abstract = {Aberrant gene expression patterns in acute myeloid leukemia (AML) with balanced chromosomal translocations are often associated with dysregulation of epigenetic modifiers. The AML1/ETO (RUNX1/MTG8) fusion protein, caused by the translocation (8;21)(q22;q22), leads to the epigenetic repression of its target genes. We aimed in this work to identify critical epigenetic modifiers, on which AML1/ETO-positive AML cells depend on for proliferation and survival using shRNA library screens and global transcriptomics approaches. Using shRNA library screens, we identified 41 commonly depleted genes in two AML1/ETO-positive cell lines Kasumi-1 and SKNO-1. We validated, genetically and pharmacologically, DNMT1 and ATR using several AML1/ETO-positive and negative cell lines. We also demonstrated in vivo differentiation of myeloblasts after treatment with the DNMT1 inhibitor decitabine in a patient with an AML1/ETO-positive AML. Bioinformatic analysis of global transcriptomics after AML1/ETO induction in 9/14/18-U937 cells identified 973 differentially expressed genes (DEGs). Three genes (PARP2, PRKCD, and SMARCA4) were both downregulated after AML1/ETO induction, and identified in shRNA screens. In conclusion, using unbiased shRNA library screens and global transcriptomics, we have identified several driver epigenetic regulators for proliferation in AML1/ETO-positive AML. DNMT1 and ATR were validated and are susceptible to pharmacological inhibition by small molecules showing promising preclinical and clinical efficacy.},

Both N. cadamba and N. macrophylla are used for various purposes, including the production of wood for the pulp industry, plywood manufacturing, and construction and carpentry materials (Soerianegara and Lemmens, 1993;Kartawinata, 1994;Lempang, 2014). Additionally, N. cadamba is recognized for its potential medicinal benefits, including pain relief, anti-inflammatory properties, antipyretic effects (Mondal et al., 2009), as well as antimicrobial (Acharyya et al., 2011), and antibacterial (Mishra and Siddique, 2011) activities.The cultivation of N. cadamba and N. macrophylla is still hindered by the lack of access to superior seeds from breeding programs. Most seeds used for various planting initiatives are sourced from natural forests or plantation forests that are classified as Identified Seed Stands (TBT), where no tree breeding activities have been conducted (UPT Perbenihan Tanaman Hutan Jawa Timur, 2022). As a result, these stands often exhibit high growth variability, along with low productivity and poor wood quality. To address these issues, prioritizing the development of fast-growing native species should be a focus for tree breeding and silviculture research. This approach can help create superior native forest plant species that could potentially reduce the dominance of exotic species in virtually all industrial plantation forests across Indonesia. However, there is still limited genetic information available for N. cadamba and N. macrophylla from Indonesia, particularly concerning genome sequencing and microsatellite markers, also known as Simple Sequence Repeats (SSRs). This lack of data poses challenges for developing effective cultivation strategies, as these data are needed for genetic research and breeding.Chloroplast genomes are valuable for phylogenetic analysis because they are predominantly maternally inherited, possess a conserved gene structure and content, and exhibit a low mutation frequency (Palmer et al., 1988). Moreover, chloroplast genomes provide essential data for population genetics, molecular identification, and genetic engineering (Powell et al., 1995;Daniell et al., 2016;Cao et al., 2022). On the other hand, microsatellite markers play crucial role in cultivar identification, assessing genetic diversity, genome mapping, quantitative trait loci (QTL) analysis, paternity analysis, crossspecies transferability, segregation analysis, phylogenetic relationships, and identification of wild cross hybrids in plant species (Miah et al., 2013;Ahmad et al., 2018).To date, several studies have focused on whole-genome sequencing of two species. One study characterized the complete genome of Neolamarckia macrophylla from South Sulawesi, Indonesia, using the Illumina HiSeq Nova platform and examined its phylogenetic relationship with N. cadamba and other species (Shi et al., 2020). Another study characterized the complete chloroplast genome of Neolamarckia cadamba from Guangdong province of China using Illumina pair-end sequencing (Li et al., 2018). However, both studies lack the development of microsatellite markers. This gap highlights the critical need to investigate the genomes and microsatellites of N. cadamba and N. macrophylla from Indonesia, as these populations may harbor unique genetic characteristics. In this study, whole genome sequencing data from N. cadamba and N. macrophylla were used to complete the chloroplast genome and screen microsatellite (or Simple Sequence Repeats, SSRs) markers for future molecular studies.The plant material used in this study consisted of silica-gel dried leaf samples collected from the adult tree of Neolamarckia cadamba (white jabon) planted in Kediri Forest Management Unit (KPH), Kediri Regency, East Java Province, Indonesia (-7\&\#176;55\&\#39;38,61163\&quot; S, 112\&\#176;11\&\#39;46,13546 E) and the adult tree of Neolamarckia macrophylla (red jabon) planted in Special Purpose Forest Area (KHDTK) Parung Panjang, Bogor Regency, West Java Province, Indonesia (-6\&\#176;23\&\#39;9,54262\&quot; S, 106\&\#176;31\&\#39;23,97738\&quot; E). The Neolamarckia cadamba tree used in this study originated from Nusakambangan Island, Indonesia (Sample code: AI NJ18), while the Neolamarckia macrophylla tree was sourced from Laeya District, South Konawe Regency, Southeast Sulawesi Province, Indonesia (Sample code: S016-1 Prov1 Blok3).The silica-gel dried leaf samples from the two species underwent genomic DNA extraction using the Cetyltrimethylammonium bromide (CTAB) method (Doyle and Doyle, 1990). Initial quantification and purity of the genomic DNA were observed using Nanodrop 2000 (Thermo Scientific) and visualized through agarose gel electrophoresis. Qubit dsDNA BR Assay Kits (Thermo Scientific) were used for accurate DNA quantification. The genomic DNA of N. cadamba (concentration of 120 ng/μL and amount of 2,23 μg) and N. macrophylla (concentration of 7,96 ng/μL and amount of 0,398 μg) that passed the quality check were then subjected to library preparation and whole genome sequencing utilizing the Illumina NextSeq 500 System, producing a data output of 6 GB per sample.Sequencing data were uploaded to the Galaxy web platform, specifically the public server at usegalaxy.org version 23.1.2.dev0 (https://usegalaxy.eu/) for analysis (Afgan et al., 2016). The quality of raw reads was assessed using FASTQC version 0.12.1 (https://www.bioinformatics.babraham.ac.uk/projects/fastqc/) (Andrews, 2010), and clean reads were filtered with Fastp version 0.23.2 (https://github.com/OpenGene/fastp) (Chen et al., 2018) using the default parameters. Clean reads were assembled using SPAdes version 3.15.3 (Bankevich et al., 2012) and NOVOPlasty version 4.3.1 (Dierckxsens et al., 2017), both with default parameters. The assembly results were then annotated using GeSeq (https://chlorobox.mpimp-golm.mpg.de/geseq.html) (Tillich et al., 2017). The fully annotated genome was illustrated using OrganellarGenomeDRAW v1.3.1 (Greiner et al., 2019).Microsatellite (SSR) markers were extracted using Krait: Microsatellites Investigation and Primer Design version v1.5.1 (Du et al., 2018) from the scaffolds of N. cadamba and N. macrophylla. The minimum repetition rates were set as follows: six for motifs with two bases and five for motifs with three, four, five, and six bases. A minimum gap of 100 bases was maintained between different microsatellite motifs. Sequences containing these microsatellite motifs were selected based on two criteria: (i) the flanking regions must be at least 150 base pairs (bp) in length on both sides and (ii) the microsatellite repeats should have the longest repeat motif. The microsatellite markers were then designed using Krait: Microsatellites Investigation and Primer Design, version 1.5.1 (Du et al., 2018), with default parameters.The chloroplast genome of N. cadamba exhibited a typical quadripartite structure (Figure 1) with a total length of 154,973 bp. This genome comprises small single copy (SSC: 17,845 bp) and large single copy (LSC: 85,861 bp) regions, separated by a pair of inverted repeat regions: inverted repeat A (IRA: 25.633 bp) and inverted repeat B (IRB: 25,634 bp) (Figure 1). The N. cadamba chloroplast genome contained 126 genes in total, including 84 protein-coding genes (78 of which are unique), 36 transfer RNA (tRNA) genes (29 unique), and 8 ribosomal RNA (rRNA) genes, comprising 4 unique rRNA sequences (Supplementary Table 1). The GC content of the N. cadamba sequence is 37.6\% (LSC: 35.4\%; SSC: 31.6\%; IR: 43.2\%). These findings are consistent with previous results reported by Li et al. (2018), that the size of the chloroplast genome of N. cadamba was 154,999 bp, harbouring an SSC of 17,851 bp, LSC of 85,880 bp, and a pair of inverted repeats (IRs) of 25,634 bp. Li et al. (2018) also reported the presence of 130 genes, where 96 were unique and 17 were duplicated in the IRs. The coding regions comprised 79 protein genes, 30 tRNA genes, and 4 rRNA genes, and the overall GC content of the chloroplast genome was 37.6\%.Similarly, the chloroplast genome of N. macrophylla also displays a quadripartite structure (Figure 1) with a length of 155,498 bp. This genome includes small single copy (SSC: 18,100 bp) and large single copy (LSC: 88,847 bp) regions, similarly separated by inverted repeat regions: IRA (24,275 bp) and IRB (24,276 bp) (Figure 2). The N. macrophylla chloroplast genome consisted of 126 genes, encompassing 84 protein-coding sequences with 29 unique sequences, 36 transfer RNA (tRNA) genes (29 unique), and 8 ribosomal RNA (rRNA) genes comprising 4 unique rRNA sequences (Supplementary Table 1). The GC content of the N. macrophylla sequence is 37.5\% (LSC: 35.6\%; SSC: 31.6\%; IR: 43.4\%). These findings align with the study by Shi et al. (2020), which revealed that the complete chloroplast genome of N. macrophylla is 155,406 bp and includes an SSC of 18,063 bp, an LSC of 86,013 bp, and a pair of IR regions of 25,665 bp each. Shi et al. (2020) also identified 128 genes, including 8 rRNA, 36 tRNA, and 84 protein-coding genes, and reported that the overall GC content of the chloroplast genome was 37.56\%.The analysis of microsatellites (SSRs) in N. macrophylla and N. cadamba (Table 1) revealed that N. macrophylla contained a greater number of SSRs, totaling 157,972, compared to 112,439 for N. cadamba. Additionally, the number of sequences containing SSRs was also greater in N. macrophylla, with 50,133 sequences compared to 34,884 in N. cadamba. Furthermore, candidate microsatellite markers were selected based on the richness of T/C content, consisting of 20 markers for N. cadamba (Supplementary Table 2) and 20 markers for N. macrophylla (Supplementary Table 3). The selected microsatellite marker candidates for each species will play a crucial role in future comprehensive analyses aimed at unraveling the genetic diversity of each species. This investigation will enhance the understanding of their unique genetic structures and evolutionary relationships, thereby providing invaluable support for advanced breeding programs.},

Here, we report the discovery and comprehensive analysis of silent but functional MGCs in the non-magnetotactic phototrophic bacterium Rhodovastum atsumiense . Our findings suggest that these MGCs were acquired by horizontal gene transfer and inactivated through transcriptional silencing and antisense RNA regulation. At least several magnetosome genes from G2-11 retained functionality, as their products restore magnetosome biosynthesis in isogenic deletion mutants of the model MTB Magnetospirillum gryphiswaldense . Although G2-11 was found to form magnetosomes upon the laboratory transfer of the MGCs from M. gryphiswaldense , strong negative selection led to rapid loss of this trait upon subcultivation. Our results provide the first insight into the horizontal dissemination of gene clusters encoding bacterial magnetic organelles outside MTB and illuminate the potential mechanisms of their genomic preservation in a latent state.},

 abstract = {Horizontal gene transfer is a powerful source of innovations in prokaryotes that can affect almost any cellular system, including microbial organelles. The formation of magnetosomes, one of the most sophisticated microbial mineral-containing organelles synthesized by magnetotactic bacteria for magnetic navigation in the environment, was also shown to be a horizontally transferrable trait. However, the mechanisms determining the fate of such genes in new hosts are not well understood, since non-adaptive gene acquisitions are typically rapidly lost and become unavailable for observation. This likely explains why gene clusters encoding magnetosome biosynthesis have never been observed in non-magnetotactic bacteria. Here, we report the first discovery of a horizontally inherited dormant gene clusters encoding biosynthesis of magnetosomes in a non-magnetotactic phototrophic bacterium Rhodovastum atsumiense. We show that these clusters were inactivated through transcriptional silencing and antisense RNA regulation, but retain functionality, as several genes were able to complement the orthologous deletions in a remotely related magnetotactic bacterium. The laboratory transfer of foreign magnetosome genes to R. atsumiense was found to endow the strain with magnetosome biosynthesis, but strong negative selection led to rapid loss of this trait upon subcultivation, highlighting the trait instability in this organism. Our results provide insight into the horizontal dissemination of gene clusters encoding complex prokaryotic organelles and illuminate the potential mechanisms of their genomic preservation in a dormant state.},

 abstract = {Molecular mechanisms which underpin compound leaf development in some legumes have been reported, but there is no previous study on the molecular genetic control of compound leaf formation in Vigna unguiculata (cowpea), an important dryland legume of African origin. In most studied species with compound leaves, class 1 KNOTTED-LIKE HOMEOBOX genes expressed in developing leaf primordia sustain morphogenetic activity, allowing leaf dissection and the development of leaflets. Other genes, such as, SINGLE LEAFLET1 in Medicago truncatula and Trifoliate in Solanum lycopersicum, are also implicated in regulating compound leaf patterning. To set the pace for an in-depth understanding of the genetics of compound leaf development in cowpea, we applied RNA-seq and whole genome shotgun sequence datasets of a spontaneous cowpea unifoliate mutant and its trifoliate wild-type cultivar to conduct comparative reference-based gene expression, de novo genome-wide isoform switch, and genome variant analyses between the two genotypes. Our results suggest that genomic variants upstream of LATE ELONGATED HYPOCOTYL and down-stream of REVEILLE4, BRASSINOSTERIOD INSENSITIVE1 and LATERAL ORGAN BOUNDARIES result in down-regulation of key components of cowpea circadian rhythm central oscillator and brassinosteroid signaling, resulting in unifoliate leaves and brassinosteroid-deficient-like phenotypes. We have stated hypotheses that will guide follow-up studies expected to provide more insights.},

 abstract = {SummaryA standard method for the identification of novel RNAs or proteins is homology search via probabilistic models. One approach relies on the definition of families, which can be encoded as covariance models (CMs) or Hidden Markov Models (HMMs). While being powerful tools, their complexity makes it tedious to investigate them in their (default) tabulated form. This specifically applies to the interpretation of comparisons between multiple models as in family clans. The Covariance model visualization tools (CMV) visualize CMs or HMMs to: I) Obtain an easily interpretable representation of HMMs and CMs; II) Put them in context with the structural sequence alignments they have been created from; III) Investigate results of model comparisons and highlight regions of interest.AvailabilitySource code (http://www.github.com/eggzilla/cmv), web-service (http://rna.informatik.uni-freiburg.de/CMVS) Contactegg@informatik.uni-freiburg.de, choener@bioinf.uni-leipzig.deSupplementary informationSupplementary data available online.},

 abstract = {The hepatic acute-phase response is characterized by a massive upregulation of serum proteins, such as haptoglobin and serum amyloid A, at the expense of liver homeostatic functions. Although the transcription factor hepatocyte nuclear factor 4 alpha (HNF4A) has a well-established role in safeguarding liver function and its cistrome spans around 50\% of liver-specific genes, its role in the acute-phase response has received little attention so far. We demonstrate that HNF4A binds to and represses acute-phase genes under basal conditions. The reprogramming of hepatic transcription during inflammation necessitates loss of HNF4A function to allow expression of acute-phase genes while liver homeostatic genes are repressed. In a pre-clinical liver organoid model overexpression of HNF4A maintained liver functionality in spite of inflammation-induced cell damage. Conversely, HNF4A overexpression potently impaired the acute-phase response by retaining chromatin at regulatory regions of acute-phase genes inaccessible to transcription. Taken together, our data extend the understanding of dual HNF4A action as transcriptional activator and repressor, establishing HNF4A as gatekeeper for the hepatic acute-phase response.},

 abstract = {Desmin, the major intermediate filament (IF) protein in muscle cells, interlinks neighboring myofibrils and connects the whole myofibrillar apparatus to myonuclei, mitochondria, and the sarcolemma. However, desmin is also known to be enriched at postsynaptic membranes of neuromuscular junctions (NMJs). The pivotal role of the desmin IF cytoskeletal network is underscored by the fact that over 120 mutations of the human \textit{DES} gene cause hereditary and sporadic myopathies and cardiomyopathies. A subgroup of human desminopathies comprises autosomal recessive cases resulting in the complete abolition of desmin protein. In these patients, who display a more severe phenotype than the autosomal dominant cases, it has been reported that some individuals also suffer from a myasthenic syndrome in addition to the classical occurrence of myopathy and cardiomyopathy. Since further studies on the NMJ pathology are hampered by the lack of available human striated muscle biopsy specimens, we exploited homozygous desmin knock-out mice which closely mirror the striated muscle pathology of human patients lacking desmin protein. Here, we report on the impact of the lack of desmin on the structure and function of NMJs and the transcription of genes coding for postsynaptic proteins. Desmin knock-out mice display a fragmentation of NMJs in soleus, but not in the extensor digitorum longus muscle. Moreover, soleus muscle fibers show larger NMJs. Further, transcription levels of acetylcholine receptor (AChR) genes are increased in muscles from desmin knock-out mice, especially of the AChRγ subunit, which is known as a marker of muscle fiber regeneration. Electrophysiological recordings depicted a pathological decrement of nerve-dependent endplate potentials and an increased rise time of the nerve-independent miniature endplate potentials. The latter appears related to the fragmentation of NMJs in desmin knockout mice. Our study highlights the essential role of desmin for the structural and functional integrity of mammalian NMJs.},

@article{eisenhardt_genotyping_2022,
 abstract = {Background: Synovial sarcoma (SS) is a malignant soft tissue tumor of mesenchymal origin that frequently occurs in young adults. Translocation of the SYT gene on chromosome 18 to the SSX genes on chromosome X leads to the formation of oncogenic fusion genes, which lead to initiation and proliferation of tumor cells. The detection and quantification of circulating tumor DNA (ctDNA) can serve as a non-invasive method for diagnostics of local or distant tumor recurrence, which could improve survival rates due to early detection. Methods: We developed a subtype-specific targeted next-generation sequencing (NGS) approach specifically targeting SS t(X;18)(p11;q11), which fuses SS18 (SYT) in chromosome 18 to SSX1 or SSX2 in chromosome x, and recurrent point mutations. In addition, patient-specific panels were designed from tumor exome sequencing. Both approaches were used to quantify ctDNA in patients’ plasma. Results: The subtype-specific assay allowed detection of somatic mutations from 25/25 tumors with a mean of 1.68 targetable mutations. The minimal limit of detection was determined at a variant allele frequency of 0.05\%. Analysis of 29 plasma samples from 15 tumor patients identified breakpoint ctDNA in 6 patients (sensitivity: 40\%, specificity 100\%). The addition of more mutations further increased assay sensitivity. Quantification of ctDNA in plasma samples (n = 11) from one patient collected over 3 years, with a patient-specific panel based on tumor exome sequencing, correlated with the clinical course, response to treatment and tumor volume. Conclusions: Targeted NGS allows for highly sensitive tumor profiling and non-invasive detection of ctDNA in SS patients, enabling non-invasive monitoring of tumor dynamics.},

@article{el-sawalhi_epidemiological_2023,
 abstract = {Antibiotic resistance is a worldwide public health concern and has been associated with reports of elevated mortality. According to the One Health concept, antibiotic resistance genes are transferrable to organisms, and organisms are shared among humans, animals, and the environment. Consequently, aquatic environments are a possible reservoir of bacteria harboring antibiotic resistance genes. In our study, we screened water and wastewater samples for antibiotic resistance genes by culturing samples on different types of agar media. Then, we performed real-time PCR to detect the presence of genes conferring resistance to beta lactams and colistin, followed by standard PCR and gene sequencing for verification. We mainly isolated Enterobacteriaceae from all samples. In water samples, 36 Gram-negative bacterial strains were isolated and identified. We found three extended-spectrum β-lactamase (ESBL)-producing bacteria—Escherichia coli and Enterobacter cloacae strains—harboring the CTX-M and TEM groups. In wastewater samples, we isolated 114 Gram-negative bacterial strains, mainly E. coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Citrobacter freundii and Proteus mirabilis strains. Forty-two bacterial strains were ESBL-producing bacteria, and they harbored at least one gene belonging to the CTX-M, SHV, and TEM groups. We also detected carbapenem-resistant genes, including NDM, KPC, and OXA-48, in four isolates of E. coli. This short epidemiological study allowed us to identify new antibiotic resistance genes present in bacterial strains isolated from water in Marseille. This type of surveillance shows the importance of tracking bacterial resistance in aquatic environments.
IMPORTANCE Antibiotic-resistant bacteria are involved in serious infections in humans. The dissemination of these bacteria in water, which is in close contact with human activities, is a serious problem, especially under the concept of One Health. This study was done to survey and localize the circulation of bacterial strains, along with their antibiotic resistance genes, in the aquatic environment in Marseille, France. The importance of this study is to monitor the frequency of these circulating bacteria by creating and surveying water treatments.},

 abstract = {Owing to the increasing number of IoT gadgets and the growth of big data, we are now facing massive amounts of diverse data that require proper preprocessing before they can be analyzed. Conventional methods involve sending data directly to the cloud, where it is cleaned and sorted, resulting in a more crowded network, increased latency, and a potential threat to users’ privacy. This paper presents an enhanced version of the BlueEdge framework—a neural network solution designed for the automated classification of data types on edge devices. We achieve this by utilizing a feed-forward neural network and optimized features to identify the presence of 14 distinct data types. Because of this, input data can be preprocessed near its source, and not in the cloud. We utilized a comprehensive dataset comprising 1400 samples, encompassing various data formats from around the world. Compared with rule-based methods, experimental assessment achieves better performance, and results in reduced data transmission (reduced by 62\%) and processing latency (78 times faster than cloud-based systems), with resource efficiency comparable to low-end mobile devices. Additionally, our strategy demonstrates strong performance under various data conditions, achieving accuracy levels of over 85\% on datasets that may include variations and a noise level as high as 20\%. The approach used here is capable of processing data for IoT devices used in education, which can lead to more efficient connections with the cloud and better privacy preservation.

 abstract = {Natural Killer (NK) cells are vital components of the innate immune system, playing a crucial role in defending the body against tumors and virally infected cells. While various methods exist for their isolation, the profound impact of these techniques on NK cell biology remains poorly characterized.This study presents a comprehensive analysis of the transcriptomic profiles of NK cells isolated using different positive selection methods; anti-CD56, anti-CD7 (with two distinct lineage depletion protocols), and a combination of anti-CD16 and anti-CD56 antibodies, compared to negative selection using immunomagnetic beads. Our integrated analysis of RNA-Seq datasets revealed that the isolation method is a dominant source of transcriptomic variation, accounting for 68.6 \% of the total dataset variance, with technical factors being inextricably confounded with this biological signal. We identified extensive method-specific transcriptional signatures, with minimal overlap ({\textless}0.1 \%) in differentially expressed genes (DEGs) across techniques. Functional enrichment analysis demonstrated that these signatures correspond to starkly different functional states: anti-CD16/anti-CD56 selection enriched for a highly activated, cytotoxically competent NK cell population with upregulated pathways in cytotoxicity and immune surveillance, while one anti-CD7-based method captured NK cells in a suppressed state, showing significant downregulation of lymphocyte activation and cytotoxicity pathways. Marker expression analysis further revealed extreme inter-study heterogeneity, with fold-changes in key cytotoxic genes exceeding 70,000-fold between methods. These findings highlight that the choice of isolation technique is not neutral but fundamentally determines the transcriptional and functional identity of the studied NK cell population. Our results highlight the critical importance of methodological standardization in NK cell research and provide essential guidance for selecting isolation strategies tailored to specific research or therapeutic applications.},

Eliciting these responses and coordinating the necessary energy shifts likely involves retrograde signalling by mitochondrial-derived peptides (MDPs). Members of the group were suggested before to play a role in heterothermic physiology, a key component of hibernation and daily torpor. Here we studied the mitochondrial single-nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) m.3017C{\textgreater}T that resides in the evolutionarily conserved gene MT-SHLP6. The substitution occurring in several mammalian orders causes truncation of SHLP6 peptide size from twenty to nine amino acids. Public mass spectrometric (MS) data of human SHLP6 indicated a canonical size of 20 amino acids, but not the use of alternative translation initiation codons that would expand the peptide. The shorter isoform of SHLP6 was found in heterothermic rodents at higher frequency compared to homeothermic rodents (p {\textless} 0.001). In heterothermic mammals it was associated with lower minimal body temperature (Tb, p {\textless} 0.001). In the thirteen-lined ground squirrel, brown adipose tissue—a key organ required for hibernation, showed dynamic changes of the steady-state transcript level of mt-Shlp6. The level was significantly higher before hibernation and during interbout arousal and lower during torpor and after hibernation. Our finding argues to further explore the mode of action of SHLP6 size isoforms with respect to mammalian thermoregulation and possibly mitochondrial retrograde signalling.},

We show that the greatest abundance of Fe(III)-reduction and Fe(II)-oxidation genes were attributed to Acidobacteriota and were most abundant in the microbiomes of peatlands and iron sulfide soils, respectively. This is consistent with the high levels of dissolved Fe recorded in rivers draining such areas. In contrast, genes encoding the biosynthesis of siderophores deployed in iron sequestration in response to Fe deficiency peaked in agroecosystems with the majority assigned to Actinomycetota. Siderophore synthesis genes were negatively correlated with Fe(III)-reduction and Fe(II)-oxidation genes, supporting the view of divergent communities under low and high iron availability.

 abstract = {Enhanced rock weathering (EW) is an emerging atmospheric carbon dioxide removal (CDR) strategy being scaled up by the commercial sector. Here, we combine multiomics analyses of belowground microbiomes, laboratory-based dissolution studies, and incubation investigations of soils from field EW trials to build the case for manipulating iron chelators in soil to increase EW efficiency and lower costs. Microbial siderophores are high-affinity, highly selective iron (Fe) chelators that enhance the uptake of Fe from soil minerals into cells. Applying RNA-seq metatranscriptomics and shotgun metagenomics to soils and basalt grains from EW field trials revealed that microbial communities on basalt grains significantly upregulate siderophore biosynthesis gene expression relative to microbiomes of the surrounding soil. Separate in vitro laboratory incubation studies showed that micromolar solutions of siderophores and high-affinity synthetic chelator (ethylenediamine-N,N′-bis-2-hydroxyphenylacetic acid, EDDHA) accelerate EW to increase CDR rates. Building on these findings, we develop a potential biotechnology pathway for accelerating EW using the synthetic Fe-chelator EDDHA that is commonly used in agronomy to alleviate the Fe deficiency in high pH soils. Incubation of EW field trial soils with potassium-EDDHA solutions increased potential CDR rates by up to 2.5-fold by promoting the abiotic dissolution of basalt and upregulating microbial siderophore production to further accelerate weathering reactions. Moreover, EDDHA may alleviate potential Fe limitation of crops due to rising soil pH with EW over time. Initial cost-benefit analysis suggests potassium-EDDHA could lower EW-CDR costs by up to U.S. \$77 t CO2 ha–1 to improve EW’s competitiveness relative to other CDR strategies.},

Employing them as bioinputs constitutes an environmentally sound strategy, particularly within the rhizospheric community. This study revealed the draft genome sequence of Stenotrophomonas geniculata LGMB417, which was originally isolated from root samples of maize (Zea mays L.). This research assessed the potential of a bacterial strain at the molecular level through genome mining, aiming to identify genes with biotechnological significance for promoting plant growth and protection. The assembly findings indicate that strain LGMB417 possesses a genome size of 4,654,011 bp, with a G + C content of 66.50\%. The draft genome sequence revealed the presence of gene clusters responsible for the synthesis of secondary metabolites and carbohydrate active enzymes (CAZymes), glycoside hydrolases (23), glycosyltransferases (18), carbohydrate esterases (5), polysaccharide lyases (2), carbohydrate-binding modules (2), and auxiliary activities (1). Several genes related to growth promotion were found in the genome, including those associated with phosphate transport and solubilization, nitrogen metabolism, siderophore production and iron transport, hormonal modulation, stress responses (such as to drought, temperature fluctuations, osmotic challenges, and oxidative conditions), and volatile organic compounds (VOCs). Subsequent phases will encompass investigations utilizing gene expression methodologies, with future explorations concentrating on facets pertinent to agricultural production, including comprehensive field studies.},

The aim of the present study was to investigate the parallel effects of {\textless}em{\textgreater}APOE{\textless}/em{\textgreater} genetic variants and promoter methylation levels of six CpGs on the risk of diabetic dyslipidemia. A total of 204 Palestinian type 2 diabetes (T2D) patients (mean age ± SD: 62.7±10.2) were enrolled in the present study (n=96 with dyslipidemia and n=108 without dyslipidemia). Next generation sequencing was performed to analyze five single nucleotide polymorphisms: Two variants rs7412 and rs429358 that determine {\textless}em{\textgreater}APOE{\textless}/em{\textgreater} ε alleles, and three variants in the promoter region (rs769446, rs449647, and rs405509). For all subjects, the most common genotype was ε3/ε3 (79.4\%). No statistical differences were observed in the {\textless}em{\textgreater}APOE{\textless}/em{\textgreater} ε polymorphisms and the three promoter variants among T2D patients with and without dyslipidemia (P\&gt;0.05). A comparison of lipid parameters between ε3/ε3 subjects and ε4 carriers in both groups revealed no significant differences in the mean values of LDL‑C, HDL‑C, TG, and TC levels (P\&gt;0.05). Six CpG sites in the {\textless}em{\textgreater}APOE{\textless}/em{\textgreater} promoter on chromosome 19:44905755‑44906078 were identified, and differential DNA methylation in these CpGs were observed between the study groups.

In conclusion, the present study revealed that DNA methylation levels in six CpGs in the {\textless}em{\textgreater}APOE{\textless}/em{\textgreater} promoter region was associated with the risk of diabetic dyslipidemia independently of the {\textless}em{\textgreater}APOE{\textless}/em{\textgreater} ε4 variant which could be a potential therapeutic target to reverse the methylation of the {\textless}em{\textgreater}APOE{\textless}/em{\textgreater} promoter.},

Rbm3 protein shows conserved structural and molecular similarities to heterogeneous nuclear ribonucleoproteins (hnRNPs), which regulate all steps of the mRNA metabolism. Growing evidence is pointing towards a broader role of Rbm3 in various steps of gene expression. Here, we demonstrate that Rbm3 deficiency is linked to transcriptome-wide pre-mRNA splicing alterations, which can be reversed through Rbm3 co-expression from a cDNA. Using an MS2 tethering assay, we show that Rbm3 regulates splice site selection similar to other hnRNP proteins when recruited between two competing 5 ′ splice sites. Furthermore, we show that the N-terminal part of Rbm3 encompassing the RNA recognition motif (RRM), is sufficient to elicit changes in splice site selection. On the basis of these findings, we propose a novel, undescribed function of Rbm3 in RNA splicing that contributes to the preservation of transcriptome integrity.},

@article{erny_downregulation_2025,
 abstract = {Cardiac hypertrophy is a key mechanism that allows the heart to adapt to increased load, but in the long term is associated with a higher risk for heart failure, arrhythmia, and death. During hypertrophic growth, cardiac myocytes signal to endothelial cells via vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) to promote angiogenesis and maintain myocardial oxygen supply. Insufficient angiogenesis leads to a decline in capillary density and drives the progression from compensated cardiac hypertrophy to heart failure. Here, we studied the time course of endothelial cell gene expression during heart failure development and identified transcriptional regulators of cell proliferation and angiogenesis. We applied transverse aortic constriction (TAC) in mice and isolated cardiac endothelial cells for RNA sequencing after 6 h and 1, 3, 7, or 28 days to create an inventory of gene expression during the course of cardiac hypertrophy and failure. Echocardiography revealed that decompensated heart failure occurred between days 7 and 28 after TAC. At the same time, we observed a switch in endothelial cell gene expression with an upregulation of proliferation markers in the hypertrophy state but downregulation in decompensated heart failure. Of note, endothelial cell cycle arrest occurred despite strong VEGF signaling from cardiac myocytes, indicating VEGF resistance. To investigate how endothelial cell proliferation is transcriptionally regulated, we performed a weighted gene co-expression network analysis and identified a module of 180 cell cycle-related genes. We predicted transcription factor 19 (TCF19), ATPase family AAA domain containing 2 (ATAD2), and transcription factor Dp-1 (TFDP1) to be central regulators of this gene module. Knockdown of TCF19 and ATAD2 by siRNA in HUVECs led to a downregulation of the marker of proliferation MKI67 and repressed cell proliferation, tube formation, and cell migration, confirming their regulatory function. In heart tissue biopsies from patients with aortic stenosis, TCF19 and ATAD2 abundance were positively correlated with endothelial cell proliferation. TCF19 or ATAD2 control the expression of a gene network involved in endothelial cell proliferation and angiogenesis. Downregulation of TCF19 and ATAD2 is associated with endothelial cell cycle arrest and an impaired angiogenic response to VEGF signaling that may promote the transition from compensated cardiac hypertrophy to heart failure.},

A comprehensive strategy is utilized, incorporating methods such as prediction of activity spectra for substances (PASS) prediction, absorption, distribution, metabolism, excretion, and toxicity (ADMET) assessments, and density functional theory (B3LYP) calculations using three basis sets: 6-31G(d,p), 6-311G(d,p), and 6-311++G(d,p). Furthermore, the study employed molecular docking technique to identify target proteins, including HER2 (7JXH), EGFR (4UV7), FPPS (1YQ7), HPGDS (1V40), DCK (1P60), and KEAP1 on Nrf2 (1X2J), for the investigated compounds, with cianidanol and genistein serving as reference drugs for the docking process. The investigated fluoro-flavonoid compounds exhibited significantly greater binding affinities (ranging from −8.3 to −10.6 kcal mol−1) toward HER2, HPGDS, and KEAP1 compared to the reference drugs, cianidanol and genistein, which displayed binding affinities ranging from −8.4 to −9.4 kcal mol−1. Furthermore, molecular dynamics simulations were conducted to assess the stability of the protein-ligand interaction, using the root-mean-square deviation (RMSD), root-mean-square fluctuation (RMSF), Radius of gyration (Rg) parameters and principle component analysis (PCA). Among the tested fluoro-flavonoid analogs, analog 11 showed a RMSD value of .15 nm with the HER2 protein target, indicating a stable interaction. Based on in silico results, it appears that the fluoro-flavonoid compound 11 has the potential to serve as a targeted anti-lung cancer drug. However, additional in vivo and in vitro studies are necessary to confirm this hypothesis.},

 abstract = {Shiga toxin–producing Escherichia coli (STEC) infection can cause potentially fatal hemolytic uremic syndrome (HUS). To determine epidemiologic and bacterial genomic factors associated with HUS, we conducted a retrospective case–control study with 108 HUS cases and 416 unmatched controls (non-HUS) selected among STEC notifications in Ireland during 2017–2020. We combined routinely collected epidemiologic data on STEC notifications with genomewide association study findings and used logistic regression to estimate adjusted odds ratios. Our findings reaffirmed known risk factors, such as young age (0–9 years) and presence of specific stx genes or gene combinations (stx2a; stx1a + stx2a; stx1a + stx2c), and additionally suggest that having outbreak-associated infection, residence within the East region of Ireland, and the combined presence of both ygiW and group\_5720 or both pfkA and fieF genes are potentially associated with developing HUS. Our findings could improve early identification of high-risk STEC infections and help guide enhanced surveillance and public health management.},

 abstract = {The aerial surfaces of plants harbour diverse communities of microorganisms. The rising awareness concerning the potential roles of these phyllosphere microbiota for airborne pollutant remediation and plant growth promotion, advocates for a better understanding of their community structure and dynamics in urban ecosystems. Here, we characterised the epiphytic microbial communities on leaves of Platanus x hispanica trees in the city centre of Hasselt (Belgium), and the nearby forest area of Bokrijk, Genk (Belgium). We compared the influences of season, site, and air pollutants concentration variations on the tree’s phyllosphere microbiome by determining the intra- and inter-individual variation in leaf bacterial communities. High-throughput amplicon sequencing of the 16S rRNA gene revealed large variation in the bacterial community structure and diversity throughout the years but also allowed to discriminate an environment effect on community assembly. Partial drivers for this environment effect on composition can be correlated with the huge differences in ultrafine particulate matter (UFP) and black carbon on the leaves. A change in bacterial community composition was noted for trees growing in the city centre compared to the natural site, and also more human-associated genera were found colonising the leaves from the city centre. These integrated results offer an original and first insight in the Platanus phyllomicrobiota, which can offer new opportunities to use phyllosphere microorganisms to enhance air pollution degradation.},

 abstract = {Owls (Strigiformes) evolved speciﬁc adaptations to their nocturnal predatory lifestyle, such as asymmetrical ears, a facial disk, and a feather structure allowing silent ﬂight. Owls also share some traits with diurnal raptors and other nocturnal birds, such as cryptic plumage patterns, reversed sexual size dimorphism, and acute vision and hearing. The genetic basis of some of these adaptations to a nocturnal predatory lifestyle has been studied by candidate gene approaches but rarely with genome-wide scans. Here, we used a genome-wide comparative analysis to test for selection in the early history of the owls. We estimated the substitution rates in the coding regions of 20 bird genomes, including 11 owls of which ﬁve were newly sequenced. Then, we tested for functional overrepresentation across the genes that showed signals of selection. In the ancestral branch of the owls, we found traces of positive selection in the evolution of genes functionally related to visual perception, especially to phototransduction, and to chromosome packaging. Several genes that have been previously linked to acoustic perception, circadian rhythm, and feather structure also showed signals of an accelerated evolution in the origin of the owls. We discuss the functions of the genes under positive selection and their putative association with the adaptation to the nocturnal predatory lifestyle of the owls.},

 abstract = {The human genome encodes thousands of non-coding RNAs. Many of these terminate early and are then rapidly degraded, but how their transcription is restricted is poorly understood. In a screen for protein-coding gene transcriptional termination factors, we identified ZC3H4. Its depletion causes upregulation and extension of hundreds of unstable transcripts, particularly antisense RNAs and those transcribed from so-called super-enhancers. These loci are occupied by ZC3H4, suggesting that it directly functions in their transcription. Consistently, engineered tethering of ZC3H4 to reporter RNA promotes its degradation by the exosome. ZC3H4 is predominantly metazoan -interesting when considering its impact on enhancer RNAs that are less prominent in single-celled organisms. Finally, ZC3H4 loss causes a substantial reduction in cell proliferation, highlighting its overall importance. In summary, we identify ZC3H4 as playing an important role in restricting non-coding transcription in multicellular organisms.},

@article{estrada_mallarino_nephronophthisis_2020,
 abstract = {Mutations of cilia-associated molecules cause multiple developmental defects that are collectively termed ciliopathies. However, several ciliary proteins, involved in gating access to the cilium, also assume localizations at other cellular sites including the nucleus, where they participate in DNA damage responses to maintain tissue integrity. Molecular insight into how these molecules execute such diverse functions remains limited. A mass spectrometry screen for ANKS6-interacting proteins suggested an involvement of ANKS6 in RNA processing and/or binding. Comparing the RNA-binding properties of the known RNA-binding protein BICC1 with the three ankyrin-repeat proteins ANKS3, ANKS6 (NPHP16) and INVERSIN (NPHP2) confirmed that certain nephronophthisis (NPH) family members can interact with RNA molecules. We also observed that BICC1 and INVERSIN associate with stress granules in response to translational inhibition. Furthermore, BICC1 recruits ANKS3 and ANKS6 into TIA-1-positive stress granules after exposure to hippuristanol. Our findings uncover a novel function of NPH family members, and provide further evidence that NPH family members together with BICC1 are involved in stress responses to maintain tissue and organ integrity.},

@article{fabian-morales_identification_2024,
 abstract = {Background Retinal dystrophies (RDs) are the most common cause of inherited blindness worldwide and are caused by genetic defects in about 300 different genes. While targeted next-generation sequencing (NGS) has been demonstrated to be a reliable and efficient method to identify RD disease-causing variants, it doesn't routinely identify pathogenic structural variant as copy number variations (CNVs). Targeted NGS-based CNV detection has become a crucial step for RDs molecular diagnosis, particularly in cases without identified causative single nucleotide or Indels variants. Herein, we report the exome sequencing (ES) data-based read-depth bioinformatic analysis in a group of 30 unrelated Mexican RD patients with a negative or inconclusive genetic result after ES. Methods CNV detection was performed using ExomeDepth software, an R package designed to detect CNVs using exome data. Bioinformatic validation of identified CNVs was conducted through a commercially available CNV caller. All identified candidate pathogenic CNVs were orthogonally verified through quantitative PCR assays. Results Pathogenic or likely pathogenic CNVs were identified in 6 out of 30 cases (20\%), and of them, a definitive molecular diagnosis was reached in 5 cases, for a final diagnostic rate of 17\%. CNV-carrying genes included CLN3 (2 cases), ABCA4 (novel deletion), EYS, and RPGRIP1. Conclusions Our results indicate that bioinformatic analysis of ES data is a reliable method for pathogenic CNV detection and that it should be incorporated in cases with a negative or inconclusive molecular result after ES.},

Bacterial and fungal endophytes were isolated from C. limon surface-sterilized seeds. The isolated fungi-belonging to Aspergillus, Quambalaria and Bjerkandera genera-and bacteria-belonging to Staphylococcus genus-were characterized for indoleacetic acid production and phosphate solubilization. Next Generation Sequencing based approaches were then used to characterize the endophytic bacterial and fungal microbiota structures of surface-sterilized C. limon seeds and of shoots obtained under aseptic conditions from in vitro growing seedlings regenerated from surface-sterilized seeds. This analysis highlighted that Cutibacterium and Acinetobacter were the most abundant bacterial genera in both seeds and shoots, while Cladosporium and Debaryomyces were the most abundant fungal genera in seeds and shoots, respectively. The localization of bacterial endophytes in seed and shoot tissues was revealed by Fluorescence In Situ Hybridization coupled with Confocal Laser Scanning Microscopy revealing vascular bundle colonization. Thus, these results highlighted for the first time the structures of endophytic microbiota of C. limon seeds and the transmission to shoots, corroborating the idea of a vertical transmission of plant microbiota and suggesting its crucial role in seed germination and plant development.},

@article{fadilah_complete_2026,
 abstract = {Red meranti is considered a primary commercial product in the timber trade, recognized as the leading roundwood commodity with a total volume of 653.49 thousand m\&\#179; in 2020 (BPS 2021). This type of wood is characterized by its straight, cylindrical trunk and is primarily sourced from natural forests. There are also efforts to cultivate red meranti through sustainable forest management practices (Wistara et al., 2016). Previous reports indicated that the survival rate of the red meranti exceeds 67\%, with a Mean Annual Diameter Increment (MADI) above 1.7 cm/year (Widiyatno et al., 2020).As a member of the Dipterocarpaceae family, red meranti comprises approximately 75 species found in the lowland tropical rainforests of the Indo-Malayan region (Steenis 1983). Rubroshorea leprosula (Miq.) P. S. Ashton and J. Heck, a synonym for Shorea leprosula Miq. (Ashton and Heckenhauer, 2022), is locally known as meranti tembaga. It is also internationally traded as part of the light red meranti timber group (Ng et al., 2021). Typically, R. leprosula grows up to 1.000 m above sea level and has an estimated extent of occurrence (EOO) of over 2 million km 2 . This species is native to Southeast Asia, with a natural distribution that includes Singapore, Peninsular Malaysia, Peninsular Thailand, the Indonesian islands of Java, Sumatra, and Borneo (Kalimantan, Brunei Darussalam, Sabah, and Sarawak) (Pooma and Newman, 2024). R. leprosula is a timber tree known for its high economic value and significant presence in both regional and international tropical timber markets (Harahap et al., 2018). It is traded and utilized as raw material for various applications, including light and heavy construction, furniture, flooring, and plywood (Purwaningsih and Kintamani, 2018;Alex et al., 2023). This species is a key product of lowland tropical rainforests and serves as symbols of these ecosystems (Yu et al., 2021). The harvested timber of R. leprosula shows promising prospects, as it is classified as commercial wood class 1 (Djarwanto et al., 2017), with a strength class of III (Wahyudi and Sitanggang, 2016) and durability class of III-IV (Kartasujana and Martawijaya, 1973). However, the high value of R. leprosula has led to overexploitation and unsustainable harvesting under the Timber Forest Product Utilization Permit (Izin Usaha Pemanfaatan Hasil Hutan Kayu -Hutan Alam, IUPHHK-HA), as well as illegal logging and trade. Logging activity continues to be reported in Gunung Leuser National Park, where loggers specifically target R. leprosula due to its accessibility and ease of processing compared to other species (Harnelly et al., 2016). Moreover, R. leprosula typically occurs in late successional stages and is considered a climax species in lowland dipterocarp forests, characterized by low regeneration rates (Nurfatma et al. 2017). It also shows low natural regeneration in degraded habitats such as Tesso Nilo National Park (Kusumo et al., 2016). Consequently, it has low dominance in protected forests like Bukit Barisan Selatan National Park (Prayoga et al., 2019). These ecological characteristics render the species highly vulnerable to habitat disturbance and overexploitation, especially in concentrated areas such as the now-abandoned PT. Patriadi concession. As a result, the population of R. leprosula has been declining due to the conversion of forest land into agricultural and industrial plantation areas (Gaveau et al., 2016;Harahap et al., 2018), which has contributed to a continuous decrease in its global population. According to the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) Red List of Threatened Species, this species is globally classified as Near Threatened (NT) and has undergone a 20-29\% reduction over the past three generations (approximately 210 years) (Pooma and Newman, 2024). Indonesia is known as a wood-producing country that exported timber products, including those from illegal logging, to partner countries such as China and Japan from 2001 to 2010, with volumes estimated at 11,000 m\&\#179; and 12,000 m\&\#179; Roundwood Equivalent (RWE), respectively (Ji et al., 2018). In 2013, about 80 million m\&\#179; of RWE was illegally produced across nine countries, with approximately 50\% of this illegal supply originating from Indonesia (Hoare 2015). However, only 3,829 m\&\#179; of illegal wood was seized in 2017 (Ministry of Environment and Forestry 2019). This situation highlights the urgent need for conservation efforts to protect and sustain the existing populations of R. leprosula. Identifying the species and origin of illegal wood is challenging without reliable identification methods. The most established method for wood identification is the study of wood anatomy, which characterizes species based on their internal structure. However, this method can sometimes be challenging in distinguishing wood species, particularly within meranti species, leading to the development of other methods, such as chemical and genetic methods. However, genetic methods are currently considered more accurate for identifying wood species and their origins (Finkeldey et al., 2009;Lowe and Cross, 2011) through genomic information.Unlocking genomic data for R. leprosula is vital for enhancing wood identification and developing genetic conservation strategies. Among various genomic resources, the chloroplast genome is particularly valuable, as it provides crucial insights into genetic variation among closely related species. In plants, the chloroplast genome or plastome is a semi-autonomous structure enclosed in double membranes, housing independent genetic material (Dobrogojski et al., 2020;Daniell et al., 2021). These organelles possess molecular machinery that regulates gene expression (Chevigny et al., 2020) and play a vital role in various physiological processes within plants (Mahapatra et al., 2021). The chloroplast genome is a valuable tool for genetic studies due to its slow evolutionary rate, maternal inheritance in most angiosperms, and its conserved structure and gene sequences (Zulfahmi et al., 2015;Song et al., 2019). In angiosperms, the chloroplast genome typically ranges from 107 kb to 218 kb and encodes 120 to 130 genes crucial for transcription, translation, and photosynthesis (Daniell et al., 2016;Li et al., 2024). Due to its conservation, the chloroplast genome serves as a reliable resource for molecular identification, genetic diversity assessment, and phylogenetic studies (Chew et al., 2023;Kim et al., 2024). The genome of Rubroshorea leprosula from Malaysia has been sequenced using the Illumina HiSeq platform to study comparative genomics and molecular dating of the evolution of the Dipterocarpaceae family, highlighting the role of drought in aseasonal tropical rainforests (Ng et al., 2021). Another Rubroshorea leprosula genome from China was sequenced by Yu et al. (2021) using the Illumina NovoSeq 6000 platform to conduct a comprehensive evolutionary analysis of chloroplast genomes from 20 species of Dipterocapoideae and to identify barcoding loci for species identification. However, data on the genomic resources for R. leprosula from Indonesia are still limited, as the Indonesian population may harbor unique genetic characteristics. This lack of information poses a significant challenge to advancing research on developing chloroplast DNA (cpDNA) markers, which are essential for genetic conservation efforts. Therefore, this study aims to assemble and characterize the complete chloroplast genome of Rubroshorea leprosula from Indonesia, generated from short-read sequencing, and to analyze its phylogenetic relationship with other species. This study enhances understanding of the genetics of R. leprosula from Indonesia and contributes to wood identification and conservation efforts. It represents a vital step toward preserving this species and enriching the knowledge of plant genetics.The plant material used in this study consisted of silica-gel dried cambium sample collected from Rubroshorea leprosula from Bukit Tigapuluh National Park, Riau Province on Sumatra Island, Indonesia (-0.814669 S, 102.528702 E), specifically from one individual mature tree with a stem diameter at the breast height of 50.8 cm and total height approximately 21 m with straight stem (Figure 1) to ensure the quality and consistency of the samples obtained. The cambium sample was scraped with a stainless-steel scalpel blade to form a sawdust-like material. The sawdust was then ground again with a Qiagen TissueLyser II. A total of 100 mg of the cambium powder sample was used for genomic DNA extraction and isolation following the modified Cetyltrimethylammonium Bromide (CTAB) protocol (Doyle and Doyle, 1990). Specifically, the modifications involve two incubations: 65 \&\#176;C for 60 min and 37 \&\#176;C for 30 min, with an additional 20 \&\#181;L of Proteinase K before the first incubation and 20 \&\#181;L of RNase A before the second. The initial quantification and assessment of genomic DNA purity were conducted using a Nanodrop 2000 spectrophotometer (Thermo Scientific), which exhibited a concentration of 300.3 ng/μL, A260/280 of 1.81, and A260/230 of 1.18, and was visualized via 1\% Tris-Borate-EDTA (TBE) agarose gel electrophoresis. To achieve accurate DNA quantification, Qubit dsDNA HS Assay Kits (Thermo Scientific) were utilized. The genomic DNA samples of R. leprosula exhibited a concentration of 13.1 ng/μL and a total amount of 458.5 μg. The high-molecular-weight genomic DNA extracted from R. leprosula was subsequently used for library preparation to facilitate subsequent short-read sequencing. Libraries were prepared according to the protocol provided by Novogen AIT, Singapore, for the Illumina NovaSeq 6000. The sequencing was done through PT. Genetika Science Indonesia, resulting in a data output of 3 GB. Short-read sequencing has been selected for this study due to its well-established application in the reconstruction of chloroplast genomes. Its high accuracy and coverage facilitate reliable assembly and annotation of the chloroplast genome, while also offering cost-effective solutions for study purposes (Wang et al., 2018). All data analysis was conducted at the Forest Genetics and Molecular Forestry Laboratory within the Department of Silviculture, Faculty of Forestry and Environment at IPB University in Bogor, West Java, Indonesia.Raw reads of the Rubroshorea leprosula from Illumina NovaSeq 6000 sequencing (Fastq) were uploaded to the Galaxy web platform, specifically the public server at usegalaxy.org v25.0.4.dev0 (https://usegalaxy.eu/) for analysis (Afgan et al. 2016). Quality control was conducted to evaluate the quality of reads. The quality of raw short-reads was assessed using FastQC v0.12.1 (Andrews, 2010), and clean reads were filtered with Fastp v0.24.0 (Chen et al., 2018) using default parameters. Clean reads were assembled using SPAdes v3.15.3 (Bankevich et al., 2012) and GetOrganelle v1.7.7.1 (Jin et al., 2020), both with default parameters. SPAdes v3.15.3 uses an adaptive multi-k-mer strategy by default. This approach was considered appropriate for the high-quality Illumina short-read data employed in this study and has been widely applied in chloroplast genome assembly. To improve accuracy, the assembled contigs were polished using Pilon v1.20.1 (Walker et al., 2014). These contigs were then mapped to the reference plastome of Shorea leprosula, a synonym of Rubroshorea leprosula (GenBank accession: MZ160997.1). The assembly results were then annotated using GeSeq (https://chlorobox.mpimp-golm.mpg.de/geseq.html) (Tillich et al., 2017). The fully annotated circular genome was visualized using OrganellarGenomeDRAW (OGDRAW) v1.3.1 accessible through the MPI-MP Chlorobox platform (Greiner et al., 2019).In order to evaluate the phylogenetic position of the reconstructed chloroplast relative to those of closely related organisms and to assess the possible effects of these differences, a phylogenetic analysis was conducted. A total of 20 chloroplast genomes of taxa closely related to Rubroshorea leprosula (from the Dipterocarpaceae family) were downloaded from GenBank (the National Center for Biotechnology Information/NCBI) and aligned with the obtained plastomes. A complete list of the accessions used is given in Supplementary Table 1. Neolamackia cadamba (NC\_041149.1) was included and used as an outgroup. The sequences were processed in Mega X v12.1.1 (Kumar et al, 2018) and aligned with MAFFT v7.526 (Katoh and Standley, 2013) using default parameters. A maximum likelihood (ML) phylogenetic tree was inferred with the IQ-TREE Web Server (Trifinopoulos et al., 2016), applying 1,000 bootstrap replicates. The phylogenetic tree was visualized using iTOL (Letunic and Bork 2024).Short-read sequencing of Rubroshorea leprosula generated a total of 20,499,674 reads, equivalent to 3 gigabase pairs (Gbp) of raw data. The mean read length was 150 bp, and the mean read quality score of the raw data was recorded at 36. After filtering, all reads passed the quality assessment with the same score. The complete chloroplast genome of R. leprosula has been successfully assembled using short-read (Illumina NovaSeq 6000) sequencing data to resolve structural regions. The Rubroshorea leprosula chloroplast genome exhibits a typical quadripartite structure (Figure 2a) with a total length of 150,691 bp. The genome consists of a Small Single-copy Region (SSC: 19,917 bp) and a Large Single-copy Region (LSC: 83,740 bp), separated by a pair of inverted repeat regions: Inverted Repeat A (IRA: 23,517 bp) and Inverted Repeat B (IRB: 23,517 bp) (Figure 2a). The GC content of the R. leprosula sequence is 34.2\%. This finding is nearly comparable in size to the Shorea leprosula syn.Rubroshorea leprosula chloroplast genome reported by Yu et al. (2021), which is 152,100 bp. Furthermore, similar chloroplast genome sizes were also found in Shorea macrophylla syn.Rubroshorea macrophylla, at 150,778 bp (Chew et al., 2023), and Rubroshorea johorensis, at 149,968 bp (Nugroho et al., 2025). These results indicate that the chloroplast genome size in the Sumatran population of Rubroshorea leprosula is relatively conserved and consistent within the Rubroshorea or Shorea group, at around 150 kb. The Rubroshorea leprosula chloroplast genome contains a total of 115 genes, including 80 protein-coding genes, 30 transfer RNA (tRNA) genes, and 4 ribosomal RNA (rRNA) genes (Supplementary Table 2). These genes are categorized into four functional groups: selfreplicating genes, photosynthetic genes, genes with other functions, and genes of unknown function (Supplementary Table 2). In the Rubroshorea leprosula chloroplast genome, of the total identified genes, 19 contain introns, suggesting that RNA processing events may play a crucial role in gene expression and regulation, as further detailed in Supplementary Table 2.Similar to other plant chloroplasts, R. leprosula likely exhibits high levels of recombination and structural rearrangements, traits characteristic of plant chloroplast genomes that contribute to genome plasticity. However, variations in gene content and intron presence may indicate species-specific adaptations that could be linked to environmental factors or evolutionary history. The results of chloroplast genome sequencing of R. leprosula indicated that, although the assembled genome remains limited, it can be used for further population genetic studies, providing essential data for designing conservation strategies for this species. This underscores the need for further research in this area.Conducting additional comparative genomic studies may provide deeper insights into the functional implications of these genomic features in R. leprosula.The phylogenetic tree of R. leprosula based on the complete chloroplast genome showed that the studied R. leprosula was in the same clade as other species within the same genus, specifically Shorea pachyphylla (NC\_040966.1) syn. Rubroshorea pachyphylla, with a bootstrap value of 100\% (Figure 2b). Additionally, R. leprosula forms a monophyletic clade with Parashorea chinensis (NC\_046579.1), Shorea zeylanica (NC\_040965.1) syn. Doona zeylanica, Hopea reticulata (NC\_052744.1), and Hopea chinensis (NC\_053766.1), emphasizing the intricate evolutionary connections among these taxa. This finding aligns with the study by Yu et al. (2021), which reported that the phylogenetic tree of the genus Rubroshorea (syn. Shorea) was not monophyletic. The present study provides an updated phylogenetic analysis of R. leprosula, contributing to a deeper understanding of the evolutionary dynamics that characterize R. leprosula and its related species.},

We have compiled functional Galaxy pipelines for DIA processing, which provide a web-based graphical user interface to these pre-installed and pre-configured tools for their use on freely accessible, powerful computational resources of the Galaxy framework. This approach also enables seamless sharing workflows with full configuration in addition to sharing raw data and results.

 abstract = {Liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) has become the most commonly used technique in explorative proteomic research. A variety of open-source tools for peptide-spectrum matching have become available. Most analyses of explorative MS data are performed using conventional settings, such as fully specific enzymatic constraints. Here we evaluated the impact of the fragment mass tolerance in combination with the enzymatic constraints on the performance of three search engines. Three open-source search engines (Myrimatch, X! Tandem, and MSGF+) were evaluated concerning the suitability in semi- and unspecific searches as well as the importance of accurate fragment mass spectra in non-specific peptide searches. We then performed a semispecific reanalysis of the published NCI-60 deep proteome data applying the most suited parameters. Semi- and unspecific LC-MS/MS data analyses particularly benefit from accurate fragment mass spectra while this effect is less pronounced for conventional, fully specific peptide-spectrum matching. Search speed differed notably between the three search engines for semi- and non-specific peptide-spectrum matching. Semispecific reanalysis of NCI-60 proteome data revealed hundreds of previously undescribed N-terminal peptides, including cases of proteolytic processing or likely alternative translation start sites, some of which were ubiquitously present in all cell lines of the reanalyzed panel. Highly accurate MS2 fragment data in combination with modern open-source search algorithms enable the confident identification of semispecific peptides from large proteomic datasets. The identification of previously undescribed N-terminal peptides in published studies highlights the potential of future reanalysis and data mining in proteomic datasets.},

In this paper, the use of nano-pulling, a technology that enables the intracellular generation of extremely low mechanical forces is explored. It is demonstrated that force-mediated axon growth also exerts global effects that extend to the nuclear level. The mechanistic studies support a model in which exogenous forces induce microtubule stabilization, and significant remodeling of perinuclear microtubules, which preferentially align perpendicularly to the nuclear envelope. An increase in the lateral tension of the nucleus is observed, leading to substantial remodeling of nuclear morphology, characterized by an increase in nuclear grooves and a higher sphericity index (indicating less flattened nuclei). Notably, these changes in nuclear shape are linked to chromatin remodeling, resulting in global transcriptional activation.},

However, empirical observations reveal that these large proteogenomic databases produce lower-sensitivity peptide identifications. Various strategies have been proposed to avoid this, including the generation of reduced transcriptome-informed protein databases, which only contain proteins whose transcripts are detected in the sample-matched transcriptome. These were found to increase peptide identification sensitivity. Here, we present a detailed evaluation of this approach.{\textless}h4{\textgreater}Results{\textless}/h4{\textgreater}We establish that the increased sensitivity in peptide identification is in fact a statistical artifact, directly resulting from the limited capability of target-decoy competition to accurately model incorrect target matches when using excessively small databases. As anti-conservative false discovery rates (FDRs) are likely to hamper the robustness of the resulting biological conclusions, we advocate for alternative FDR control methods that are less sensitive to database size. Nevertheless, reduced transcriptome-informed databases are useful, as they reduce the ambiguity of protein identifications, yielding fewer shared peptides. Furthermore, searching the reference database and subsequently filtering proteins whose transcripts are not expressed reduces protein identification ambiguity to a similar extent, but is more transparent and reproducible.{\textless}h4{\textgreater}Conclusions{\textless}/h4{\textgreater}In summary, using transcriptome information is an interesting strategy that has not been promoted for the right reasons.

We performed functional characterization of a promising candidate effector of M. perniciosa. The inoculation of rBASIDIN at 4 µmol L−1 in the mesophyll of leaflets of Solanum lycopersicum caused symptoms of shriveling within 6 h without the presence of necrosis. However, when sprayed on the plant at a concentration of 11 µmol L−1, it caused wilting symptoms only 2 h after application, followed by necrosis and cell death at 48 h. rBASIDIN applied to Theobroma cacao leaves at the same concentration caused milder symptoms. rBASIDIN caused hydrogen peroxide production in leaf tissue, damaging the leaf membrane and negatively affecting the photosynthetic rate of Solanum lycopersicum plants. Phylogenetic analysis indicated that BASIDIN has orthologs in other phytopathogenic basidiomycetes. Analysis of the transcripts revealed that BASIDIN and its orthologs are expressed in different fungal species, suggesting that this protein is differentially regulated in these basidiomycetes. Therefore, the results of applying BASIDIN allow the inference that it is an effector of the fungus M. perniciosa, with a strong potential to interfere in the defense system of the host plant.},

However, genes from this family of transcription factors have a much wider potential for genomic regulation. KZNFs have become integrated into gene-regulatory networks through the control of TEs that function as enhancers and gene promoters; some KZNFs also bind directly to gene promoters, suggesting an additional, more direct layer of KZNF co-option into gene-regulatory networks. Binding site analysis of ZNF519, ZNF441, and ZNF468 suggests the structural evolution of KZNFs to recognize TEs can result in coincidental binding to gene promoters independent of TE sequences. We show a higher rate of sequence turnover in gene promoter KZNF binding sites than neighboring regions, implying a selective pressure is being applied by the binding of a KZNF. Through CRISPR/Cas9 mediated genetic deletion of ZNF519, ZNF441, and ZNF468, we provide further evidence for genome-wide co-option of the KZNF-mediated gene-regulatory functions; KZNF knockout leads to changes in expression of KZNF-bound genes in neuronal lineages. Finally, we show that the opposite can be established upon KZNF overexpression, further strengthening the support for the role of KZNFs as bona-fide gene regulators. With no eminent role for ZNF519 in controlling its TE target, our study may provide a snapshot into the early stages of the completed co-option of a KZNF, showing the lasting, multilayered impact that retrovirus invasions and host response mechanisms can have upon the evolution of our genomes.},

Healthy individuals possess a repeat 30–55 CGG units in length. Once the CGG repeat exceeds 200 copies it triggers methylation at the locus. This methylation covers the FMR1 promoter region and silences expression of the gene and the production of FMRP (fragile X messenger ribonucleoprotein). The loss of FMRP is responsible for a number of pathologies including neurodevelopmental delay and autism spectrum disorder. Methylation of the expanded repeat in the FMR1 locus is the causal factor for FXS, however it is not known why the expanded repeat triggers this epigenetic change or how exactly DNA methylation is established. Intriguingly, genetic engineering of expanded CGG repeats of over 300 copies in the FMR1 locus in mice remains unmethylated. Also in humans, in very rare cases, individuals can have an FMR1 CGG expansion {\textgreater} 200 copies but the locus remains unmethylated.

 abstract = {The large family of KRAB zinc finger (KZNF) genes are transcription factors implicated in recognizing and repressing repetitive sequences such as transposable elements (TEs) in our genome. Through successive waves of retrotransposition-mediated insertions, various classes of TEs have invaded mammalian genomes at multiple timepoints throughout evolution. Even though most of the TE classes in our genome lost the capability to retrotranspose millions of years ago, it remains elusive why the KZNFs that evolved to repress them are still retained in our genome. One hypothesis is that KZNFs become repurposed for other regulatory roles. Here, we find evidence that evolutionary changes in KZNFs provide them not only with the ability to repress TEs, but also to bind to gene promoters independent of TEs. Using KZNF binding site data in conjunction with gene expression values from the Allen Brain Atlas, we show that KZNFs have the ability to regulate gene expression in the human brain in a region-specific manner. Our analysis shows that the expression of KZNFs shows correlation with the expression of their target genes, suggesting that KZNFs have a direct influence on gene expression in the developing human brain. The extent of this regulation and the impact it has on primate brain evolution are still to be determined, but our results imply that KZNFs have become widely integrated into neuronal gene regulatory networks. Our analysis predicts that gene expression networks have been repeatedly innovated throughout primate evolution, continuously gaining new layers of gene regulation mediated by both TEs and KZNFs in our genome.This article is part of a discussion meeting issue ‘Crossroads between transposons and gene regulation’.},

As novel molecular and genetic technologies develop, it is possible to adapt and optimize them for wildlife conservation. One such technology is environmental (e)DNA – the detection of DNA shed from organisms into their surrounding environments. We developed species-specific green (Chelonia mydas) and loggerhead (Caretta caretta) sea turtle probe-based qPCR assays, which can detect and quantify sea turtle eDNA in controlled (captive tank water and sand samples) and free ranging (oceanic water samples and nesting beach sand) settings. eDNA detection complemented traditional in-water sea turtle monitoring by enabling detection even when turtles were not visually observed. Furthermore, we report that high throughput shotgun sequencing of eDNA sand samples enabled sea turtle population genetic studies and pathogen monitoring, demonstrating that noninvasive eDNA techniques are viable and efficient alternatives to biological sampling (e.g., biopsies and blood draws). Genetic information was obtained from sand many hours after nesting events, without having to observe or interact with the target individual. This greatly reduces the sampling stress experienced by nesting mothers and emerging hatchlings, and avoids sacrificing viable eggs for genetic analysis. The detection of pathogens from sand indicates significant potential for increased wildlife disease monitoring capacity and viral variant surveillance. Together, these results demonstrate the potential of eDNA approaches to ultimately help understand and conserve threatened species such as sea turtles.},

Extrusion and emulsification methods enhanced encapsulation efficiency by up to 80\% and gave the best release patterns over two months. A greenhouse experiment using potato plants treated with alginate-whey protein microcapsules showed a decrease in \textit{Rhizoctonia} disease intensity of up to 70\%. This is because whey protein is rich in amino acids and can serve as a resistance induction agent for the plant. In this study, the use of CNT in the ALG-WP system increased the rooting and proliferation and reduced physiological complication. The results of this study showed that the technique used in encapsulation could have a significant effect on the efficiency and persistence of probiotic bacteria. Whole genome sequence analysis of strain VUPF506 identified it as \textit{Pseudomonas chlororaphis} and revealed some genes that control pathogens.},

 abstract = {ABSTRACT


Reef-building corals depend on symbiosis with photosynthetic algae that reside within their cells. As important as this relationship is for maintaining healthy reefs, it is strikingly delicate. When ocean temperatures briefly exceed the average summer maximum, corals can bleach, losing their endosymbionts. Although the mechanisms governing bleaching are unknown, studies implicate uncoupling of coral and algal cell divisions at high temperatures. Still, little is known regarding the coordination of host and algal cell divisions. Control of nutrient exchange is one likely mechanism. Both nitrogen and phosphate are necessary for dividing cells, and although nitrogen enrichment is known to increase symbiont density in the host, the consequences of phosphate enrichment are poorly understood. Here, we examined the effects of phosphate depletion on symbiont growth in culture and compared the physiology of phosphate-starved symbionts in culture to symbionts that were freshly isolated from a host. We found that available phosphate is as low in freshly isolated symbionts as it is in phosphate-starved cultures. Furthermore, RNAseq revealed that phosphate-limited and freshly isolated symbionts have similar patterns of gene expression for phosphate-dependent genes, most notably upregulation of phosphatases, which is consistent with phosphate recycling. Similarly, lipid profiling revealed a substantial decrease in phospholipid abundance in both phosphate-starved cultures and freshly isolated symbionts. These findings are important because they suggest that limited access to phosphate controls algal cell divisions within a host.


IMPORTANCE
The corals responsible for building tropical reefs are disappearing at an alarming rate as elevated sea temperatures cause them to bleach and lose the algal symbionts they rely on. Without these symbionts, corals are unable to harvest energy from sunlight and, therefore, struggle to thrive or even survive in the nutrient-poor waters of the tropics. To devise solutions to address the threat to coral reefs, it is necessary to understand the cellular events underpinning the bleaching process. One model for bleaching proposes that heat stress impairs algal photosynthesis and transfer of sugar to the host. Consequently, the host’s demands for nitrogen decrease, increasing nitrogen availability to the symbionts, which leads to an increase in algal proliferation that overwhelms the host. Our work suggests that phosphate may play a similar role to nitrogen in this feedback loop.

 abstract = {Abstract Invasion, metastasis and therapy resistance are the major cause of cancer-associated deaths, and the EMT-inducing transcription factor ZEB1 is a crucial stimulator of these processes. While work on ZEB1 has mainly focused on its role as a transcriptional repressor, it can also act as a transcriptional activator. To further understand these two modes of action, we performed a genome-wide ZEB1 binding study in triple-negative breast cancer cells. We identified ZEB1 as a novel interactor of the AP-1 factors FOSL1 and JUN and show that, together with the Hippo pathway effector YAP, they form a transactivation complex, predominantly activating tumour-promoting genes, thereby synergising with its function as a repressor of epithelial genes. High expression of ZEB1, YAP, FOSL1 and JUN marks the aggressive claudin-low subtype of breast cancer, indicating the translational relevance of our findings. Thus, our results link critical tumour-promoting transcription factors: ZEB1, AP-1 and Hippo pathway factors. Disturbing their molecular interaction may provide a promising treatment option for aggressive cancer types.},

 abstract = {Lentils are promoted as an alternative protein source given their agricultural and nutritional benefits. However, the information on microbial risks associated with the lentil supply chain in France and Hungary is limited. Bacillus cereus was identified as the pathogen of concern in both hot and cold dishes while Listeria monocytogenes was identified only in cold dishes. A probabilistic model accounting for uncertainty and variability was constructed. This estimates the microbial concentration, foodborne illness cases, and DALYs at subsequent stages of domestic handling: cooking, cooling, and 24 to 96 hours of chilled storage.First, the results were analysed at each stage, for example, at 96 h for B. cereus with mean values of 2.52 [1.75; 4.12] log CFU/g in France and 2.03 [1.24; 3.56] log CFU/g in Hungary. Meanwhile, for Listeria monocytogenes, the mean estimates were lower at 0.48 [-0.20; 1.16] log CFU/g for France and 0.69 [0.07; 1.36] log CFU/g in Hungary. Second, the overall foodborne illness cases from both pathogens were computed based on consumption frequency. They were estimated to be 0 [0-44] cases per 100,000 in France and [0-5.8] in Hungary.The confidence intervals are relatively large, reflecting the uncertainty in the estimates, meaning the risk is not an absolute zero. Moreover, it's likely that the protein shifts towards plant-based diets promoted by different institutions (e.g., EAT Lancet) and extended batch cooking practices will lead to a higher risk in the future.},

This two-step method combines phiC31 integrase-mediated site-specific integration and homing nuclease-mediated resolution of local duplications, efficiently converting the original landing site allele to modified alleles that only have the desired change(s). Dominant markers incorporated into this method allow correct individual flies to be efficiently identified at each step. In principle, single attP sites and FRT sites are also valid landing sites. Given the large and increasing number of landing site lines available in the fly community, this method provides an easy and fast way to efficiently edit the majority of the Drosophila genome in a scarless manner. This technique should also be applicable to other species.},

@article{feng_spychip_2022,
 abstract = {Chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) is an important technique for characterizing protein-DNA binding in vivo. One drawback of ChIP-based techniques is the lack of cell type-specificity when profiling complex tissues. To overcome this limitation, we developed SpyChIP to identify cell type-specific transcription factor (TF) binding sites in native physiological contexts without tissue dissociation or nuclei sorting. SpyChIP takes advantage of a specific covalent isopeptide bond that rapidly forms between the 15-amino acid SpyTag and the 17-kDa protein SpyCatcher. In SpyChIP, the target TF is fused with SpyTag by genome engineering, and an epitope tagged SpyCatcher is expressed in cell populations of interest, where it covalently binds to SpyTag-TF. Cell type-specific ChIP is obtained by immunoprecipitating chromatin prepared from whole tissues using antibodies directed against the epitope-tagged SpyCatcher. Using SpyChIP, we identified the genome-wide binding profiles of the Hox protein Ultrabithorax (Ubx) in two distinct cell types of the \textit{Drosophila} haltere imaginal disc. Our results revealed extensive region-specific Ubx-DNA binding events, highlighting the significance of cell type-specific ChIP and the limitations of whole-tissue ChIP approaches. Analysis of Ubx::SpyChIP results provided insights into the relationship between chromatin accessibility and Ubx-DNA binding, as well as different mechanisms Ubx employs to regulate its downstream \textit{cis}-regulatory modules. In addition to SpyChIP, we suggest that SpyTag-SpyCatcher technology, as well as other protein pairs that form covalent isopeptide bonds, will facilitate many additional in vivo applications that were previously impractical.},

 abstract = {In eukaryotes, members of transcription factor families often exhibit similar DNA binding properties in vitro, yet orchestrate paralog-specific gene regulatory networks in vivo. The serially homologous first (T1) and third (T3) thoracic legs of Drosophila, which are specified by the Hox proteins Scr and Ubx, respectively, offer a unique opportunity to address this paradox in vivo. Genome-wide analyses using epitope-tagged alleles of both Hox loci in the T1 and T3 leg imaginal discs, the precursors to the adult legs and ventral body regions, show that {\textasciitilde}8\% of Hox binding is paralog-specific. Binding specificity is mediated by interactions with distinct cofactors in different domains: the Hox cofactor Exd acts in the proximal domain and is necessary for Scr to bind many of its paralog-specific targets, while in the distal leg domain, the homeodomain protein Distal-less (Dll) enhances Scr binding to a different subset of loci. These findings reveal how Hox paralogs, and perhaps paralogs of other transcription factor families, orchestrate alternative downstream gene regulatory networks with the help of multiple, context-specific cofactors.},

@article{fernandes_alise_2023,
 abstract = {Alternative Splicing (AS) is a co-transcriptional mechanism that enables the eukaryote to extend its proteome even with a limited number of genes. The cellular machinery performs AS by combining alternative regions of the isoforms in both productive and non-productive transcripts. AS events can be predicted using RNASeq data. In plants, the most frequent event is the retention of introns (IR) that can have a regulatory effect, for example, inserting a premature stop codon (PTC) that leads to degradation of the transcript through the nonsense-mediated decay (NMD) pathway. To study potential AS events in the biological process of coffee bean and tomato ripening, we conducted a DAS study using RNASeq data obtained for differential expression experiment and the referential coffee genome to identify differential AS (DAS). For this, we developed pipelines in Python to perform an automated curation of the 202 target genes that were identified with 241 DAS events by rMATS in the comparisons of early green fruits, intermediate yellow and final red ripening stage. We then carried out a manual curation of the 241 events enriched with the Interproscan5 annotation with further experimentally validating of Potassium channel AKT1 and Apyrase 7 genes under differential alternative expression during coffee grain ripening using conventional PCR and qPCR. Due to challenges identified during this analysis associated with the relationship of AS events and RNASeq data processing, we built an application of user- friendly APP to predict AS in RNASeq data. The application development is composed of three modules named GeneAPPScript, GeneAPPServer, GeneAPPExplorer. The GeneAPPScript module is a powerful wrapper that enables to perform a complete DAS analysis from obtaining network data to functional annotation of genes under DAS. This module can run on Debian distros, such as the Google Collaboratory (Colab) environment where it was developed. The GeneAPPServer module is a Flask backend that allows you to integrate outputs from different DAS analysis software that generate data in tabular outputs. Using GeneAPPExplorer, the user can generate dozens of graphs to graphically visualize important results implicit in technical tables exported by DAS analysis software. In addition, through the webapp, the researcher has access to tables enriched with functional and structural annotation data and event attributes. GeneAPP will contribute to the analysis of AS in several other works deposited in public databases where only differential expression at the gene level was analyzed, allowing further explanation when exploring the transcriptome at the isoform level.},

@mastersthesis{fernandes_lama2-cmd_2024,
 abstract = {In skeletal muscle tissue, the basement membrane lining the sarcolemma coats and protects myofibers 
from contraction-induced damage. A key component of this specialized structure is the Laminin-211 
(LN211). Pathogenic mutations in the LAMA2 gene, which encodes the α2-chain of laminin-211, trigger 
a life-threatening and currently incurable disease, LAMA2-muscular dystrophy (LAMA2-MD). However, 
the classical gene therapy approaches are not feasible due to the size of the LAMA2 gene, which exceeds 
the packaging capacity of one of the most used viral vectors, the recombinant adeno-associated virus 
(rAAV). Instead of introducing the complete gene sequence into the cells, homology-directed repair 
(HDR) can theoretically correct the majority of pathogenic point mutations responsible for LAMA2-MD. 
Using the CRISPR/Cas9 system, we have established two C2C12 myoblast cell lines that carry point 
mutations in Lama2, which recapitulate the ones found in the dy2J/dy2J and dynmf417/dynmf417 mouse 
models for LAMA2-MD. Furthermore, the obtained single-cell clones were confirmed by nextgeneration sequencing (NGS) to be heterozygous for the intended mutations. The established cell lines 
were then characterized and had an impairment in myoblast differentiation and fusion into myotubes. 
The single-cell clone carrying the dynmf417 mutation was used to evaluate the reversion of the specific 
mutation with all-in-one rAAV vectors by HDR. The engineered vector encoded a smaller version of 
Cas9 from Neisseria meningitidis, Nme2Cas9, a single sgRNA and the HDR donor template. The rAAV 
production was also optimized and the AAV1 serotype was selected as the most suitable for the 
transduction of the C2C12 cells. The muscle-specific rAAV9:HDR system was not able to edit and 
revert the specific mutation in the Lama2 gene but gave critical insights into the best rAAV design 
strategies. This project will contribute to the development of a new therapeutic strategy targeting 
LAMA2-MD that will be preceded by the in vivo studies using the dy2J/dy2J mice.},

The application of these microorganisms massively affects all members of plant-colonising microbial communities, including pathogenic fungi. In the majority of cases, the resulting competition for ecological niches is decided by the toxicity of microbial secondary metabolites (SMs) formed. In this study, we devised confrontation experiments employing the fungal maize pathogen Colletotrichum graminicola and antagonistic partners, that is the biocontrol bacterium Bacillus amyloliquefaciens and the ubiquitous ascomycete Aspergillus nidulans. Transcriptome studies uncovered strong de-regulation of the vast majority of the C. graminicola secondary metabolite biosynthetic gene clusters (SMBGCs), with 69\% and 86\% of these clusters de-regulated at confrontation sites with B. amyloliquefaciens or A. nidulans, respectively. In the biocontrol bacterium and in A. nidulans confronting the maize pathogen, 100\% and 74\% of the SMBGCs were transcriptionally de-regulated, respectively. Correspondingly, non-targeted high-resolution LC-MS/MS revealed a large repertoire of 1738 and 1466 novel features formed in the fungus-bacterium and fungus-fungus confrontation, respectively. Surprisingly, several of these belong to chemical classes with lead structures of synthetic fungicides.},

 abstract = {Infertility is linked to different functions of male gametes, one of which is 
caused by impaired motility due to anomalies in sperm flagella. Several genetic 
defects culminate in the loss of fertility when viewed from an evolutionary 
perspective, where sperm flagellar function is extremely conserved across all 
kingdoms. The model moss Physcomitrium patens has genes copies homologous to 
human that are related to the architecture of microtubules that enable sperm motility. 
The moss P. patens has been an important model system for studying issues of 
evolutionary and developmental biology, as well as being an excellent model for 
studies of cellular reprogramming, in addition to collaborating with studies of 
flagellated organisms from various domains of biodiversity. Although the genes 
involved in the process of organogenesis of the reproductive structures of mosses 
are still little explored, it is believed that these may be involved in the construction of 
the motility of the flagellum and other elements of the architecture of the tissues and 
organs involved in evolution. Based on this hypothesis, our objective is to identify the 
genes responsible for the differentiation of reproductive structures and how these 
can identify problems in the formation of Organs reproductive organs of mosses. To 
achieve the objectives, a differential gene expression analysis was carried out with 
the aid of data obtained in the RNA-Seq technique. The reads used were obtained 
from the NCBI (National Center for Biotechnology Information) database, on the 
Sequence Reads Archives (SRA) platform SRR19502729, SRR19502730, 
SRR19502731, SRR19502732, SRR19502733, SRR19502734, SRR4454535 and 
SRR9901085. The raw reads were filtered by size and quality (Phred-Score 28) and 
then analyzed for transcript counts and differential gene expression analysis (DEGs) 
using the Salmon tool. As a result, the genes Pp3c10\_9456v3.1, Pp3c17\_1640V3.1 
and Pp3c17\_13470V3.1 were identified as possible genes involved in the sexual 
differentiation between sexual organs of moss, where these genes are 
over-expressed when there is formation of antheridia and under-expressed when 
there is formation of antheridia. archegoniums. Through the analysis of gene function 
and ontology, it was observed that the Pp3c10\_9456v3.1 gene is responsible for the 
determination of symmetry, morphogenesis of the anatomical structure, assembly of 
cellular components and development of organs in P. patens, being an ideal target 
for tests of gene knockout to validate its role in the differentiation of reproductive 
organs in this plant.},

 abstract = {{\textless}p{\textgreater}In plants, serpins are a superfamily of serine and cysteine protease inhibitors involved in stress and defense mechanisms, with potential for controlling agricultural pests, making them important biotechnological tools. The objective of this study was to characterize a serpin from {\textless}italic{\textgreater}Theobroma cacao{\textless}/italic{\textgreater}, called TcSERPIN, to identify its endogenous targets and determine its function and biotechnological potential. TcSERPIN has 390 amino acid residues and shows conservation of the main active site, RCL. Cis-elements related to light, stress, hormones, anaerobic induction, cell cycle regulation and defense have been identified in the gene’s regulatory region. TcSERPIN transcripts are accumulated in different tissues of {\textless}italic{\textgreater}Theobroma cacao{\textless}/italic{\textgreater}. Furthermore, in plants infected with {\textless}italic{\textgreater}Moniliophtora perniciosa{\textless}/italic{\textgreater} and {\textless}italic{\textgreater}Phytophthora palmivora{\textless}/italic{\textgreater}, the expression of TcSERPIN was positively regulated. The protein spectrum, rTcSERPIN, reveals a typical β-sheet pattern and is thermostable at pH 8, but loses its structure with temperature increases above 66°C at pH 7. At the molar ratios of 0.65 and 0.49, rTcSERPIN inhibited 55 and 28\% of the activity of papain from {\textless}italic{\textgreater}Carica papaya{\textless}/italic{\textgreater} and trypsin from {\textless}italic{\textgreater}Sus scrofa{\textless}/italic{\textgreater}, respectively. The protease trap containing immobilized rTcSERPIN captured endogenous defense proteins from cocoa extracts that are related to metabolic pathways, stress and defense. The evaluation of the biotechnological potential against geohelminth larvae showed that rTcSERPIN and rTcCYS4 ({\textless}italic{\textgreater}Theobroma cacao{\textless}/italic{\textgreater} cystatin 4) reduced the movement of larvae after 24 hours. The results of this work show that TcSERPIN has ideal biochemical characteristics for biotechnological applications, as well as potential for studies of resistance to phytopathogens of agricultural crops.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

The genomes of 29 previously identified \textit{Heyndrickxia}\textit{sporothermodurans} and two \textit{Heyndrickxia vini} strains isolated from ultra-high-temperature (UHT)-treated milk were sequenced by short-read (Illumina) sequencing. After sequence analysis, the two \textit{H. vini} strains could be reclassified as \textit{H. sporothermodurans}. In addition, the genomes of the \textit{H.}\textit{sporothermodurans} type strain (DSM 10599$^{\textrm{T}}$) and the closest phylogenetic neighbors \textit{Heyndrickxia}\textit{oleronia} (DSM 9356$^{\textrm{T}}$) and \textit{Heyndrickxia vini} (JCM 19841$^{\textrm{T}}$) were also sequenced using both long (MinION) and short-read (Illumina) sequencing. By hybrid sequence assembly, the genome of the \textit{H. sporothermodurans} type strain was enlarged by 15\% relative to the short-read assembly. This noticeable increase was probably due to numerous mobile elements in the genome that are presumptively related to spore heat tolerance. Phylogenetic studies based on 16S rDNA gene sequence, core genome, single-nucleotide polymorphisms and ANI/dDDH, showed that \textit{H. vini} is highly related to \textit{H. sporothermodurans}. When examining the genome sequences of all \textit{H.}\textit{sporothermodurans} strains from this study, together with 4 \textit{H. sporothermodurans} genomes available in the GenBank database, the majority of the 36 strains examined occurred in a clonal lineage with less than 100 SNPs. These data substantiate previous reports on the existence and spread of a genetically highly homogenous and heat resistant spore clone, i.e., the HRS-clone.},

 abstract = {Human protein Yin Yang 1 (YY1) controls the transcription of hundreds of genes both positively and negatively through interactions with a wide range of partner proteins. Results presented here from proteolytic sensitivity, calorimetry, circular dichroism, fluorescence, NMR, size-exclusion chromatography, SELEX, and EMSA show that purified YY1 forms dimers via its disordered N-terminal region with strong zinc-ion concentration dependence. The YY1 dimer is shown to bind tandem repeats of a canonical recognition DNA sequence with high affinity, and analysis of human YY1 regulatory sites shows that many contain repeats of its recognition elements. YY1 dimerization may compete with partner protein interactions, making control by zinc ion concentration a previously unrecognized factor affecting YY1 gene regulation. Indeed, YY1 is known to be important in many pathogenic processes, including neoplasia, in which zinc ion concentrations are altered. The present results incentivize studies in vivo or in vitro that explore the role of zinc ion concentration in YY1-mediated gene expression.},

As adenoviruses are a large group of viruses, displaying many different tropisms, immune epitopes, and replication characteristics, the merits of translating these natural benefits into vector applications are apparent. This translation, however, proves difficult, since while research has investigated the application of these viruses, there are no universally applicable rules in vector design for non-classical adenovirus types. In this paper, we describe a generalized workflow that allows vectorization, rescue, and cloning of all adenoviral species to enable the rapid development of new vector variants. We show this using human and simian adenoviruses, further modifying a selection of them to investigate their gene transfer potential and build potential vector candidates for future applications.},

 abstract = {Inhibition of protein-protein interactions (PPIs) via designed peptides is an effective strategy to perturb their biological functions. The Elongin BC heterodimer (ELOB/C) binds to a BC-box motif and is essential for cancer cell growth. Here, we report a peptide that mimics the high-affinity BC-box of the PRC2-associated protein EPOP. This peptide tightly binds to the ELOB/C dimer (kD = 0.46 ± 0.02 nM) and blocks the association of ELOB/C with its interaction partners, both in vitro and in the cellular environment. Cancer cells treated with our peptide inhibitor showed decreased cell viability, increased apoptosis, and perturbed gene expression. Therefore, our work proposes that blocking the BC-box-binding pocket of ELOB/C is a feasible strategy to impair its function and inhibit cancer cell growth. Our peptide inhibitor promises novel mechanistic insights into the biological function of the ELOB/C dimer and offers a starting point for therapeutics linked to ELOB/C dysfunction.},

 abstract = {The emergence of infectious diseases, particularly those caused by fungal pathogens, poses serious threats to public health, wildlife and ecosystem stability$^{\textrm{1}}$. Host-fungus interactions and environmental factors have been extensively examined$^{\textrm{2-4}}$. However, the role of genetic variability in pathogens is often less well-studied, even for diseases such as white-nose in bats, which has caused one of the highest disease-driven death tolls documented in nonhuman mammals$^{\textrm{5}}$. Previous research on white-nose disease has primarily focused on variations in disease outcomes attributed to host traits or environmental conditions$^{\textrm{6-8}}$, but has neglected pathogen variability. Here we leverage an extensive reference collection of 5,479 fungal isolates from 27 countries to reveal that the widespread causative agent is not a single species but two sympatric cryptic species, each exhibiting host specialization. Our findings provide evidence of recombination in each species, but significant genetic differentiation across their genomes, including differences in genome organization. Both species contain geographically differentiated populations, which enabled us to identify the species introduced to North America and trace its source population to a region in Ukraine. In light of our discovery of the existence of two cryptic species of the causative agent of white-nose disease, our research underscores the need to integrate the study of pathogen variability into comprehensive disease surveillance, management and prevention strategies. This holistic approach is crucial for enhancing our understanding of diseases and implementing effective measures to prevent their spread.},

However, how DNA methylation is fine-tuned-ensuring precise gene expression and developmental fidelity-remains poorly understood. PROSER1, a known TET2 interactor, was recently linked to a severe neurodevelopmental disorder. Here, we demonstrate that PROSER1 interacts with all TET enzymes and stabilizes chromatin-bound TET-OGT-PROSER1-DBHS (TOPD) complexes, which regulate DNA demethylation and developmental gene expression. Surprisingly, we found that PROSER1 also sequesters TET enzymes, preventing widespread demethylation and transposable element derepression.

@article{flores_orozco_evaluation_2024,
 abstract = {Anaerobic digestion (AD) has shown the potential to reduce the abundance of antimicrobial resistance genes (ARGs) and mobile genetic elements (MGEs) in animal manures. It stands as a promising option to reduce the risk of the spread of antimicrobial resistance (AMR) due to livestock production and manure applications. However, the underlying mechanisms driving these changes still need to be fully understood. This multidisciplinary study aimed to utilize metagenomics to investigate the molecular and microbial mechanisms associated with the evolution of ARGs and MGEs during the anaerobic digestion (AD) of bovine dairy manure. The research focused on three main aspects: 1) examining the long-term effects of mesophilic (MAD) and thermophilic (TAD) anaerobic digestion on the entire set of ARGs (resistome) and MGEs (mobilome) in manure; 2) comparing the impact of alternative manure treatments, such as storage and solid-liquid separation, on resistomes and mobilomes; 3) identifying microbial groups potentially associated with ARGs and MGEs and microbial shifts potentially driving changes in resistomes and mobilomes. A meta-analysis conducted early in this research informed the primary focus of this research. Two anaerobic digesters operating at mesophilic (36 °C) and the other at thermophilic (55 °C) temperatures were set up, operated, monitored, and studied for 4 and 2 years, respectively. Metagenomics analyses were used to evaluate resistomes, mobilomes, and microbiomes in the mesophilic and thermophilic digesters operating under steady state and in the bovine manure used as substrate. The results indicated that MAD and TAD lowered ARG levels in fresh cattle manure by over 50\% and MGEs by over 65\%. Surprisingly, TAD did not outperform MAD at reducing ARGs and MGEs. Co-occurrence analysis indicated a strong association between microbial groups from the phyla Bacillota (e.g., Jeotgalicoccus, Streptococcus, Enterococcus), Actinomycetota (e.g., Brevibacterium, Rhodococcus), and Pseudomonadota (e.g., Acinetobacter, Comamonas) with these AMR elements. The decline in the abundance of aerobic and facultative anaerobes likely linked to hydrolytic functions was suggested as one of the main drivers of the changes in resistomes and mobilomes. The proximity of toxin-antitoxin systems and transposon structures to specific ARGs (e.g., Erm, tet, Ant(6)-la) was discovered, which could explain the persistence of such ARGs in digestates. The study of the effects of other manure treatments, such as aerobic storage in an open tank and solid-liquid separation, revealed that they are less efficient in reducing ARGs and MGEs from manures than AD. In this study, the high levels of ARGs and genes conferring resistance to heavy metals in a farm operating in an antibiotic-free environment suggested that other antimicrobials, such as foot bathing solutions, may be causing the indirect selection of ARGs. Overall, this research made several contributions to understanding AMR in the context of anaerobic digestion of animal manure that could be extrapolated to other manure treatments. These contributions not only bridge existing gaps in the literature but also pave the way for future research, providing valuable insights that can be used to inform the development of more effective strategies to mitigate the dissemination of AMR associated with manure management, application, and disposal.},

 abstract = {Bacterial wilt, caused by \textit{Ralstonia solanacearum}, is one of the main challenges for sustainable tomato production in the Amazon region. This study evaluated the potential of bacteria isolated from sediments of the Solimões and Negro rivers for the biocontrol of this disease. From 36 bacteria selected through in vitro antibiosis, three promising isolates were identified: \textit{Priestia aryabhattai} RN 11, \textit{Streptomyces} sp. RN 24, and \textit{Kitasatospora} sp. SOL 195, which inhibited the growth of the phytopathogen by 100\%, 87.62\%, and 100\%, respectively. These isolates also demonstrated the ability to produce extracellular enzymes and plant growth-promoting compounds, such as indole-3-acetic acid (IAA), siderophore, and ammonia. In plant assays, during both dry and rainy seasons, \textit{P. aryabhattai} RN 11 reduced disease incidence by 40\% and 90\%, respectively, while promoting the growth of infected plants. \textit{Streptomyces} sp. RN 24 and \textit{Kitasatospora} sp. SOL 195 exhibited high survival rates (85-90\%) and pathogen suppression in the soil ({\textgreater}90\%), demonstrating their potential as biocontrol agents. This study highlights the potential of Amazonian bacteria as biocontrol agents against bacterial wilt, contributing to the development of sustainable management strategies for this important disease.},

 abstract = {The Amazon, with its vast biodiversity, harbors a complex network of ecosystems interconnected by rivers such as the Negro and Solimões. This unique dynamic favors the emergence and diversification of microbial lineages, rendering the region a hotspot for the discovery of innovative biological solutions. Within this context, this thesis investigated the biotechnological potential of 36 bacteria isolated from Amazonian river sediments, focusing on applications in phytopathogen biocontrol and plant growth promotion. The bacterial isolates were evaluated in vitro against agriculturally significant phytopathogens, including Corynespora cassiicola, Colletotrichum siamense, Rhizoctonia solani, and Ralstonia solanacearum. This initial screening gave rise to two main chapters: the first investigates the biocontrol of R. solanacearum, while the second examines the genomic potential and agricultural applications of Alcaligenes nematophilus SOL 109. In Chapter 1, three isolates - Priestia aryabhattai RN 11, Streptomyces sp. RN 24, and Kitasatospora sp. SOL 195 - demonstrated remarkable efficacy against R. solanacearum, with in vitro inhibition of 87-100\%, reduction of disease incidence by 40-90\% in tomato seedlings, and promotion of plant growth. Phylogenomic analyses based on ANI and dDDH revealed that RN 11 belongs to the species Priestia aryabhattai (ANI: 98.61\%, dDDH: 88.3\%), while RN 24 and SOL 195 presented values below the cut-off points for new species, potentially representing novel species within the genera Streptomyces and Kitasatospora, respectively. Chapter 2 elucidates the multifaceted potential of A. nematophilus SOL 109, demonstrating in vitro inhibition ranging from 74 to 93\% against phytopathogenic fungi. Under greenhouse conditions, evaluations indicate that the SOL 109 effectively controlled the pathogen R. solani and promoted growth in tomato plants. Genomic and chemical analyses of SOL 109 identified unique and shared biosynthetic gene clusters (BGCs) within the genus Alcaligenes, genes conferring resistance to antibiotics and heavy metals, and metabolites with antimicrobial properties. The results of this thesis highlight the unexplored potential of Amazonian aquatic microorganisms, revealing new actinobacterial species (RN 24 and SOL 195) and reporting for the first time the occurrence of A. nematophilus in Brazil. This study significantly contributes to the development of sustainable plant disease management strategies, offers valuable insights into the secondary metabolism of the genus Alcaligenes, and opens new perspectives for biotechnological applications in agriculture, reinforcing the importance of conservation and study of Amazonian microbial biodiversity.},

@article{formenti_gfastats_2022,
 abstract = {With the current pace at which reference genomes are being produced, the availability of tools that can reliably and efficiently generate genome assembly summary statistics has become critical. Additionally, with the emergence of new algorithms and data types, tools that can improve the quality of existing assemblies through automated and manual curation are required.We sought to address both these needs by developing gfastats, as part of the Vertebrate Genomes Project (VGP) effort to generate high-quality reference genomes at scale. Gfastats is a standalone tool to compute assembly summary statistics and manipulate assembly sequences in FASTA, FASTQ or GFA [.gz] format. Gfastats stores assembly sequences internally in a GFA-like format. This feature allows gfastats to seamlessly convert FAST* to and from GFA [.gz] files. Gfastats can also build an assembly graph that can in turn be used to manipulate the underlying sequences following instructions provided by the user, while simultaneously generating key metrics for the new sequences.Gfastats is implemented in C++. Precompiled releases (Linux, MacOS, Windows) and commented source code for gfastats are available under MIT licence at https://github.com/vgl-hub/gfastats. Examples of how to run gfastats are provided in the GitHub. Gfastats is also available in Bioconda, in Galaxy (https://assembly.usegalaxy.eu) and as a MultiQC module (https://github.com/ewels/MultiQC). An automated test workflow is available to ensure consistency of software updates.Supplementary data are available at Bioinformatics online.},

Key determinants of successful library preparation are the available amount of input DNA and the efficiency of the conversion of this DNA into functional library molecules. While the standard blunt-end ligation protocol for Ion Torrent libraries has a theoretical maximum efficiency of 25\%, Y-adapters enable highly efficient library preparation by (i) sticky-end ligation and (ii) rendering both DNA strands functional for sequencing, hence resulting in a theoretical efficiency of up to 100\%. Moreover, the generation of adapter dimers is reduced. Therefore, we designed, optimized and validated Y-adapters compatible with Ion Torrent sequencing. These facilitate higher library yields combined with overall high sequencing performance regarding the key characteristics read-length, base quality, and library complexity.},

@article{foschini_methylation_2020,
 abstract = {Background: Androgen Receptor (AR) has been described to play a prominent role in Male Breast Cancer (MBC). It maps on chromosome X, and recent reports indicate that X chromosome polysomy is frequent in MBC. Since the response to anti-androgen therapy may depend on AR polysomy and on its overexpression similarly to prostate cancer, aim of the present study was to investigate the DNA methylation level of AR and its coregulators, especially those mapped on the X chromosome, that may influence the activity of AR in MBC. Methods: The DNA methylation level of AR, MAGEA2, MAGEA11, MAGEC1, MAGEC2, FLNA, HDAC6, and UXT, mapped on the X chromosome, was evaluated by quantitative Bisulfite-NGS. Bioinformatic analysis was performed in a GalaxyProject environment using BWA-METH, MethylDackel, and Methylation Plotter tools. The study population consisted of MBC (41 cases) compared with gynecomastia (15 cases). Results: MAGEA family members, especially MAGEA2, MAGEA11, MAGEC, and UXT and HDAC6 showed hypomethylation of several CpGs, reaching statistical significance by the Kruskal-Wallis test (p{\textless}0.01) in MBC when compared to gynecomastia. AR showed almost no methylation at all. Conclusions: Our study demonstrated for the first time that MAGEA family members mapped on X chromosome and coregulators of AR, are hypomethylated in male IDC. This may lead to their overexpression, enhancing AR activity, while AR itself shows very little methylation.},

 abstract = {The emergence of colistin-resistant Enterobacteriaceae in food products is a growing concern due to the potential transfer of resistance to human pathogens. This study aimed to assess the prevalence of colistin-resistant Enterobacteriaceae in raw and ready-to-eat food samples collected from two regions of Italy (Apulia and Basilicata) and to evaluate their resistance phenotypes and genetic characteristics. A total of 1000 food samples were screened, with a prevalence of 4.4\% of colistin-resistant Enterobacteriaceae. The majority of the isolates belonged to Enterobacter spp. (60\%), followed by Moellerella wisconsensis, Atlantibacter hermannii, Klebsiella pneumoniae, and Escherichia coli, among others. Genomic sequencing and antimicrobial susceptibility testing revealed high levels of resistance to β-lactams, with most isolates exhibiting multidrug resistance (MDR). Notably, seven isolates harbored mcr genes (mcr-1, mcr-9, and mcr-10). Additionally, in four of them were predicted the IncHI2 plasmids, known to facilitate the spread of colistin resistance. Furthermore, 56 antimicrobial resistance genes were identified, suggesting the genetic mechanisms underlying resistance to several antibiotic classes. Virulence gene analysis showed that E. coli and other isolates carried genes linked to pathogenicity, increasing the potential risk to public health. This study emphasizes the role of food as a potential reservoir for colistin-resistant bacteria and the importance of monitoring the spread of AMR genes in foodborne pathogens.},

@article{frank_complex-type_2021,
 abstract = {Roots supply plants with nutrients and water, besides anchoring them in the soil. The primary root with its lateral roots constitutes the central skeleton of the root system. In particular, root hairs increase the root surface, which is critical for optimizing uptake efficiency. During root-cell growth and development, many proteins that are components of, e.g., the cell wall and plasma membrane are constitutively transported through the secretory system and become posttranslationally modified. Here, the best-studied posttranslational modification is protein N-glycosylation. While alterations in the attachment/modification of N-glycans within the ER lumen results in severe developmental defects, the impact of Golgi-localized complex N-glycan modification, particularly on root development, has not been studied in detail. We report that impairment of complex-type N-glycosylation results in a differential response to synthetic phytohormones with earlier and increased root-hair elongation. Application of either the cytokinin BAP, the auxin NAA, or the ethylene precursor ACC revealed an interaction of auxin with complex N-glycosylation during root-hair development. Especially in \textit{gntI} mutant seedlings, the early block of complex N-glycan formation resulted in an increased auxin sensitivity. RNA-seq experiments suggest that \textit{gntI} roots have permanently elevated nutrient-, hypoxia-, and defense-stress responses, which might be a consequence of the altered auxin responsiveness.},

@article{friedrich_identification_2021,
 abstract = {Autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease (ADPKD) affects more than 12 million people worldwide. Mutations in PKD1 and PKD2 cause cyst formation through unknown mechanisms. To unravel the pathogenic mechanisms in ADPKD, multiple studies have investigated transcriptional mis-regulation in cystic kidneys from patients and mouse models, and numerous dysregulated genes and pathways have been described. Yet, the concordance between studies has been rather limited. Furthermore, the cellular and genetic diversity in cystic kidneys has hampered the identification of mis-expressed genes in kidney epithelial cells with homozygous PKD mutations, which are critical to identify polycystin-dependent pathways. Here we performed transcriptomic analyses of Pkd1- and Pkd2-deficient mIMCD3 kidney epithelial cells followed by a meta-analysis to integrate all published ADPKD transcriptomic data sets. Based on the hypothesis that Pkd1 and Pkd2 operate in a common pathway, we first determined transcripts that are differentially regulated by both genes. RNA sequencing of genome-edited ADPKD kidney epithelial cells identified 178 genes that are concordantly regulated by Pkd1 and Pkd2. Subsequent integration of existing transcriptomic studies confirmed 31 previously described genes and identified 61 novel genes regulated by Pkd1 and Pkd2. Cluster analyses then linked Pkd1 and Pkd2 to mRNA splicing, specific factors of epithelial mesenchymal transition, post-translational protein modification and epithelial cell differentiation, including CD34, CDH2, CSF2RA, DLX5, HOXC9, PIK3R1, PLCB1 and TLR6. Taken together, this model-based integrative analysis of transcriptomic alterations in ADPKD annotated a conserved core transcriptomic profile and identified novel candidate genes for further experimental studies.},

 abstract = {The dynamics and phenotypes of intratumoral myeloid cells during tumor progression are poorly understood. Here we define myeloid cellular states in gliomas by longitudinal single-cell profiling and demonstrate their strict control by the tumor genotype: in isocitrate dehydrogenase (IDH)-mutant tumors, differentiation of infiltrating myeloid cells is blocked, resulting in an immature phenotype. In late-stage gliomas, monocyte-derived macrophages drive tolerogenic alignment of the microenvironment, thus preventing T cell response. We define the IDH-dependent tumor education of infiltrating macrophages to be causally related to a complex re-orchestration of tryptophan metabolism, resulting in activation of the aryl hydrocarbon receptor. We further show that the altered metabolism of IDH-mutant gliomas maintains this axis in bystander cells and that pharmacological inhibition of tryptophan metabolism can reverse immunosuppression. In conclusion, we provide evidence of a glioma genotype-dependent intratumoral network of resident and recruited myeloid cells and identify tryptophan metabolism as a target for immunotherapy of IDH-mutant tumors.},

Combining spectral libraries, DIA software, sparsity reduction, normalization, and statistical tests results in 1428 distinct data analysis workflows, which we evaluate based on their ability to correctly identify differentially abundant proteins. From our dataset, we derive bootstrap datasets of varying sample sizes and use the whole range of bootstrap datasets to robustly evaluate each workflow. We find that all DIA software suites benefit from using a gas-phase fractionated spectral library, irrespective of the library refinement used. Gas-phase fractionation-based libraries perform best against two out of three reference protein lists.

Subsequently, the graft is re-infected early in the post-procedural phase, leading to viral persistence for more than five months. By analyzing viral evolution and effector immune response within the transplanted organ, we observe three main findings. First, virus evolution differs in the transplanted organ compared to that in the upper respiratory tract and is affected by monoclonal SARS-CoV-2-specific antibodies and molnupiravir. Second, we show the potential clinical relevance of T cell HLA restriction that may facilitate viral clearance in the upper respiratory tract compared to the ongoing viral replication in the HLA mismatch organ. Third, close monitoring and modulation of immunosuppressive and antiviral therapy enables viral clearance in a lung transplantation setting despite incomplete SARS-CoV-2 clearance prior to transplantation.},

Here, we present a bioinformatics command-line tool, called varVAMP (variable virus amplicons), which addresses this issue. It relies on multiple sequence alignments of highly variable virus sequences and enables degenerate primer design for qPCR or tiled amplicon whole genome sequencing. We demonstrate the utility of varVAMP by designing and evaluating novel pan-specific primer schemes suitable for sequencing the genomes of SARS-CoV-2, Hepatitis E virus, rat Hepatitis E virus, Hepatitis A virus, Borna-disease-virus-1, and Poliovirus using clinical samples. Importantly, we also designed primers on the same input data using the software packages PrimalScheme and Olivar and showed that varVAMP minimizes primer mismatches most efficiently. Finally, we established highly sensitive and specific Poliovirus qPCR assays that could potentially simplify current Poliovirus surveillance. varVAMP is open-source and available through PyPI, UseGalaxy, Bioconda, and https://github.com/jonas-fuchs/varVAMP .},

 abstract = {Long-duration spaceflight imposes significant physiological stress on astronauts, including profound alterations in immune function. This study investigated epigenetic changes in immune cells following prolonged orbital spaceflight by analysing histone modifications in CD4+ and CD8+ T-cells from astronauts before, immediately after, and during recovery from spaceflight. Using Cleavage Under Targets and Tagmentation (Cut\&amp;Tag) to assess H3K27ac modifications, we identified significant alterations in chromatin accessibility, predominantly involving immune response pathways, gene regulation, and cellular adaptation mechanisms. While some epigenetic changes were transient, others persisted beyond 50 days post-return, suggesting long-term effects. These findings enhance our understanding of immune adaptation to spaceflight and have implications for mitigating spaceflight-associated health risks. Furthermore, they provide valuable insights into immune system regulation under high-stress conditions, potentially informing research on immunodeficiency disorders, cancer epigenetics, and aging-related immune decline on Earth. This study underscores the critical role of epigenetics in long-term space missions and terrestrial health applications.},

@article{fullstone_identification_2025,
 abstract = {Platinum-based combination chemotherapy remains the backbone of first-line treatment for patients with advanced epithelial ovarian cancer (EOC). While most patients initially respond well to the treatment, patients with relapse ultimately develop platinum resistance. This study identified FLYWCH-type zinc finger-containing protein 1 (FLYWCH1) as an important regulator in the resistance development process. We showed that the loss of FLYWCH1 promotes platinum resistance in EOC cells, and the low FLYWCH1 expression is correlated with poor prognosis of EOC patients. In platinum-sensitive cells, FLYWCH1 colocalizes with H3K9me3, but this association is significantly reduced when cells acquire resistance. The suppression of FLYWCH1 induces gene expression changes resulting in the deregulation of pathways associated with resistance. In line with its connection to H3K9me3, FLYWCH1 induces gene silencing in a synthetic reporter assay and the suppression of FLYWCH1 alters H3K9me3 at promoter regions and repeat elements. The loss of FLYWCH1 leads to the derepression of LTR and Alu repeats, thereby increasing transcriptional plasticity and driving the resistance development process. Our data highlight the importance of FLYWCH1 in chromatin biology and acquisition of platinum resistance through transcriptional plasticity and propose FLYWCH1 as a potential biomarker for predicting treatment responses in EOC patients.},

Among various known virus-control strategies, RNAi-mediated defence has shown the potential to protect plants against various pathogens including viral infections. Micro(mi)RNAs play a major role in RNAi-mediated defence. Methods Using in silico analyses, we investigated the possibility of tomato-encoded miRNAs (TomiRNA) to target PhCMoV and ToBRFV genomes using five different algorithms, i.e., miRanda, RNAhybrid, RNA22, Tapirhybrid and psRNATarget. Results The results revealed that 14 loci on PhCMoV and 10 loci on ToBRFV can be targeted by the TomiRNAs based on the prediction of at least three algorithms. Interestingly, one TomiRNA, miR6026, can target open reading frames from both viruses, i.e., the phosphoprotein encoding gene of PhCMoV, and the two replicase components of ToBRFV. There are currently no commercially available PhCMoV- or ToBRFV-resistant tomato varieties, therefore the predicted data provide useful information for the development of PhCMoV- and ToBFRV-resistant tomato plants.},

The study aimed to investigate the role of the PGN2012 gene of the periodontitis contributing pathobiont Porphyromonas gingivalis. PGN2012 is a homolgue of TolC and is a gene our group previously showed was overexpressed in hyperinvasive cells.
Methods
The study used a combination of bioinformatics, knockout mutagenesis, growth experiments, biofilm assays and human cell invation assays to investigate PGN2012 function.
Results
Bioinformatics identified that PGN2012 is part of one of four TolC containing gene loci in P. gingivalis that we predicted may encode a metal resistance RND family tripartite pump, similar to those present in other Gram-negative bacteria, but which are not well understood in anaerobic bacteria. A ΔPGN2012 deletion displayed slightly reduced growth in liquid culture but did not effect biofilm formation or human cell invasion. When metal ions were included in the medium the mutant displayed significantly increased sensitivity to the divalent metal ions Zn2+ (500 μM), Co2+ (2 mM), and Cd2+(0.1 mM) but not Cu2+.
Conclusions
We propose to rename the PGN2012-2014 genes czcCBA, which we suggest plays a role in intracellular stress resistance where zinc is often employed by host cells in antibacterial defence with implications for chronic infection in humans.},

Accordingly, based on the antimicrobial properties of Thyme Essential Oil (TEO), the present study evaluated the effects of TEO on the reduction of common microbial contaminants and Salmonella on poultry litter. A litter bulk sample was collected in a broiler farm and qualitative/quantitative investigations identified Escherichia coli and Mammaliicoccus lentus. The experimental contamination with Salmonella Derby wild strain was also performed. All pathogens showed phenotypic and genotypic resistance to different classes of antibiotics. The litter, split in different units, was treated with aqueous solutions of TEO at different concentrations (5\% to 1.25\%), demonstrating its effectiveness in reducing the total number of bacteria. The strongest antibacterial action was observed at the lowest concentration against Enterobacteriaceae, with a growth reduction compared to the positive control of 73.3\% and 77.8\% against E. coli and Salmonella Derby, respectively, while towards M. lentus the reduction was 50\%. Our data confirm the antimicrobial activity of TEO and suggest its possible application for the treatment of poultry litter as an effective and natural approach for the prevention of diseases caused by the most common bacteria that colonize poultry farms, counteracting the onset of antibiotic resistance.},

 abstract = {The systematics of the family Dendrodorididae, with only three valid genera, is a challenge for integrative taxonomists. Its members lack hard structures for morphological comparisons and their mitochondrial and nuclear markers provide contradictory phylogenetic signals, making phylogenetic reconstructions difficult. This molecular discordance has been hypothesized to be the result of nuclear pseudogenes or exogenous contamination. However, these hypotheses have not been tested. Here, we assembled the first genome drafts of seven Dendrodorididae species to investigate the evolutionary processes of this family. Two of the mitogenomes displayed an identical structural rearrangement involving the translocation of three coding genes and five tRNAs, described for the first time in nudibranchs. In addition, we found particularly high dN and dN/dS values and multiple insertions and deletions on the mitochondrial genes of smooth Dendrodoris. In contrast, nuclear single-copy ortholog genes showed no such mutational differences. Models of protein structures from mitochondrial genes are conserved, suggesting conserved functionality. Phylogenies using mitogenomic and nuclear data showed that species with rearranged mitogenomes form a clade, although Dendrodorididae relationships remained unresolved. The present study provides novel evidence for accelerated mutation rates in the mitogenomes of Dendrodorididae, which presumably have implications on respiratory adaptation, and highlights the importance of using genomic data to unveil rare evolutionary processes, crucial for correctly inferring phylogenies.},

Stable isotope-resolved metabolomics and downstream data analyses are widely used techniques for unraveling cells' metabolic activity to understand the altered functioning of metabolic pathways in the diseased state. While a number of bioinformatic solutions exist for the differential analysis of Stable Isotope-Resolved Metabolomics data, there is currently no available resource providing a comprehensive toolbox.
RESULTS: In this work, we present DIMet, a one-stop comprehensive tool for differential analysis of targeted tracer data. DIMet accepts metabolite total abundances, isotopologue contributions, and isotopic mean enrichment, and supports differential comparison (pairwise and multi-group), time-series analyses, and labeling profile comparison. Moreover, it integrates transcriptomics and targeted metabolomics data through network-based metabolograms. We illustrate the use of DIMet in real SIRM datasets obtained from Glioblastoma P3 cell-line samples. DIMet is open-source, and is readily available for routine downstream analysis of isotope-labeled targeted metabolomics data, as it can be used both in the command line interface or as a complete toolkit in the public Galaxy Europe and Workfow4Metabolomics web platforms.
AVAILABILITY: DIMet is freely available at https://github.com/cbib/DIMet, and through https://usegalaxy.eu and https://workflow4metabolomics.usegalaxy.fr. All the datasets are available at Zenodo https://zenodo.org/records/10925786.

 abstract = {Stable-isotope resolved metabolomics (SIRM) is a powerful approach for characterizing metabolic states in cells and organisms. By incorporating isotopes, such as 13C, into substrates, researchers can trace reaction rates across specific metabolic pathways. Integrating metabolomics data with gene expression profiles further enriches the analysis, as we demonstrated in our prior study on glioblastoma metabolic symbiosis. However, the bioinformatics tools for analyzing tracer metabolomics data have been limited. In this protocol, we encourage the researchers to use SIRM and transcriptomics data and to perform the downstream analysis using our software tool DIMet. Indeed, DIMet is the first comprehensive tool designed for the differential analysis of tracer metabolomics data, alongside its integration with transcriptomics data. DIMet facilitates the analysis of stable-isotope labeling and metabolic abundances, offering a streamlined approach to infer metabolic changes without requiring complex flux analysis. Its pathway-based "metabologram" visualizations effectively integrate metabolomics and transcriptomics data, offering a versatile platform capable of analyzing corrected tracer datasets across diverse systems, organisms, and isotopes. We provide detailed steps for sample preparation and data analysis using DIMet through its intuitive, web-based Galaxy interface. To showcase DIMet's capabilities, we analyzed LDHA/B knockout glioblastoma cell lines compared to controls. Accessible to all researchers through Galaxy, DIMet is free, user-friendly, and open source, making it a valuable resource for advancing metabolic research.,

Through comprehensive structural, enzymology and cellular characterization of DNMT3A and DNMT3B, we here report a multi-layered substrate-recognition mechanism underpinning their divergent genomic methylation activities. A hydrogen bond in the catalytic loop of DNMT3B causes a lower CpG specificity than DNMT3A, while the interplay of target recognition domain and homodimeric interface fine-tunes the distinct target selection between the two enzymes, with Lysine 777 of DNMT3B acting as a unique sensor of the +1 flanking base. The divergent substrate preference between DNMT3A and DNMT3B provides an explanation for site-specific epigenomic alterations seen in ICF syndrome with DNMT3B mutations. Together, this study reveals crucial and distinctive substrate-readout mechanisms of the two DNMT3 enzymes, implicative of their differential roles during development and pathogenesis.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

 abstract = {Land use intensification can influence soil microbial communities and their functional potential. However, the impacts of different aspects of land use intensification on functional groups of soil microbes remain insufficiently elucidated in agroecosystems. This study investigated soil microbial groups and their functional potential in arable fields embedded in a gradient of land use intensity (LUI), integrating multiple agricultural practices in the Netherlands. The results reveal changes in soil bacterial and fungal functional groups along the LUI gradient, with a strong negative relationship between LUI and the diversity of many fungal functional groups. Changes in LUI also led to significant changes in the composition of both bacterial and fungal functional communities. Specifically, irrigation and pest control were identified as the primary practices influencing the community assembly of soil microbial functional groups. We further show that the connectivity between soil fungal functional groups decreased under higher LUI. In summary, our findings demonstrate that reducing land use intensity may have positive impacts on the functional potential of soil microbial communities, particularly for soil fungi. Sustainable management practices particularly related to irrigation and pest control may alleviate some of the observed adverse effects.},

The interplay of global and specific functions of these proteins remains poorly understood.

We show that the bulk transcriptional onset does not require Sox19b and Pou5f3, but is sensitive to their balance. Pou5f3 docks H3K27ac on the enhancers of genes involved in gastrulation and ventral fate specification. Sox19b facilitates Pou5f3 access to one-third of these enhancers. The genes regulating mesendodermal and dorsal fates are primed for activation independently on Pou5f3 and Sox19b. Strikingly, the loss of either factor results in activation of silent enhancers; simultaneous loss of both leads to premature expression of differentiation genes.

@article{garcia-jimenez_exploring_2025,
 abstract = {IntroductionThe discovery of transposable elements (TEs), or transposons, by Barbara McClintock in 1950 revolutionized our understanding of genome dynamics. TEs are recognized for their critical role in genetic variability and evolution. They are categorized into two main classes: class I (retrotransposons), which transpose via an RNA intermediate, and class II, which transpose directly via DNA. TEs significantly influence gene expression through insertions that can disrupt gene function. Consequently, organisms have evolved mechanisms to regulate TE activity, particularly under stress conditions, where TE activation can lead to mutations. In marine macroalgae, TEs are known to shape genome architecture, yet little is known about their dynamics.MethodsIn this study, 17 publicly available but non-annotated algal genomes were analyzed to identify and characterize transposable elements. The Earlgrey pipeline, a powerful tool for TE annotation, was used to quantify their diversity and historical activity. A local script was further employed to investigate the genomic co-localization of TEs with annotated protein-coding sequences.ResultsThe analysis revealed significant diversity in TE composition among red, brown, and green algae. Retrotransposons with long terminal repeats (LTRs) were found to be particularly abundant in red algae. Many of these LTRs were located near or within regions encoding proteins, as identified through three protein databases. Notably, these included LTR-specific enzymes such as ribonuclease H, as well as nucleic acid–binding proteins and cation-binding proteins like CCHC-type zinc-finger proteins and haem peroxidase superfamily members, which are involved in stress response pathways.DiscussionThe co-localization of LTRs with stress-responsive protein-coding genes raises intriguing questions about the potential regulatory interplay between TEs and stress adaptation. It remains to be determined whether LTR activity is modulated by the activation of these proteins under stress, or if LTRs have been assimilated into the cellular network to promote protein expression as part of an adaptive response. These findings suggest a promising avenue for exploring the functional integration of TEs into stress resilience mechanisms and highlight their potential role in the evolutionary dynamics of marine algae.},

In flowering plants, male gametes are produced in anthers, being encased in pollen grains. Understanding the genetic regulation of meiosis key events such as chromosome recognition and pairing, synapsis and recombination, is needed to manipulate chromosome associations for breeding purposes, particularly in important cereal crops like wheat. Reverse transcription-quantitative PCR (RT-qPCR) is widely used to analyse gene expression and to validate the results obtained by other transcriptomic analyses, like RNA-seq. Selection and validation of appropriate reference genes for RT-qPCR normalization is essential to obtain reproducible and accurate expression data. In this work, twelve candidate reference genes were evaluated using the mainstream algorithms geNorm, Normfinder, BestKeeper and ΔCt, then ranked from most to least suitable for normalization with RefFinder. Different sets of reference genes were recommended to normalize gene expression data in anther meiosis of bread and durum wheat, their corresponding genotypes in the absence of the Ph1 locus and for comparative studies among wheat genotypes. Comparisons between meiotic (anthers) and somatic (leaves and roots) wheat tissues were also carried out. To the best of our knowledge, our study provides the first comprehensive list of reference genes for robust RT-qPCR normalization to study differentially expressed genes during male meiosis in wheat in a breeding framework.},

 abstract = {Derailed gene expression programs within the developing nervous system, encompassing both transcriptional and post-transcriptional processes, can cause diverse neurodevelopmental diseases (NDD). The NDD FOXG1-syndrome lacks full understanding of the mechanistic role of its eponymous gene product. While it is known that FOXG1 acts in part at the chromatin by binding to regulative regions, it is unclear what factors control its presence at specific sites. Long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) can mediate site-directed transcription factor binding, but their potential role in FOXG1-syndrome has not been described. Here, we show that FOXG1 localisation is regulated at selected loci through the lncRNA Pantr1. We identified FOXG1 as an upstream transcriptional activator of Pantr1 in human and mice. Further, we discovered that FOXG1 has the ability to associate with RNAs. Both transcriptional regulation of Pantr1 by FOXG1 and binding of both partners build up a regulative network that impacts the localisation of FOXG1 at selected genomic loci. Specifically, Pantr1 facilitates cooperative presence of FOXG1/NEUROD1 at specific sites, and Pantr1 reduction leads to redistribution of FOXG1 to comparably more generic binding sites. The rescue of impaired dendritic outgrowth upon FOXG1 reduction by simultaneous overexpression of Pantr1 underlines the importance of the FOXG1/Pantr1 regulative network.},

 abstract = {Nanosized titanium dioxide is widely used by the industry, e.g., in pigments, suncreams, and food colors. Its environmental and biological effects have been investigated in the past; however, few studiesd have focused on its crystal structure-specific effects. In our experiments, the toxicity of two types of synthetic nanoparticles was examined on primary neural cultures with different cell compositions using MTT and LDH assays. Primary murine cell cultures containing only astroglia cells originated from two brain regions, as well as mixed neurons and glia cells or microglia cells exclusively, were treated with anatase (15.8 ± 1.7 nm average diameter) and rutile (46.7 ± 2.2 nm average length and 13.7 ± 0.7 nm average diameter) TiO\&lt;sub\&gt;2\&lt;/sub\&gt; nanoparticles at varying concentrations for 24 or 48 h. Our results show that neither anatase nor rutile nanoparticles reduced viability in cell cultures containing a mixture of neurons and glial cells, independently of the applied concentration and treatment time. Rutile but not anatase form induced cell death in cortical astroglia cultures already at 24 h of treatment above 10 µg/mL, while hippocampus-derived glial cultures were much less sensitive to rutile. The rutile form also damaged microglia. These findings suggest that products containing rutile-form nano-titanium particles may pose a targeted risk to astroglia and microglial cells in the central nervous system.},

@article{gener_full-coverage_2019,
 abstract = {Objective: To evaluate native RNA sequencing for sequencing HIV-1 viral genomes. Methods: Fifteen HIV-1 strains were processed with Direct RNA Sequencing (SQK-RNA002) library kits and sequenced on MinION Mk1B devices with RevD flow cells (Oxford Nanopore Technologies (ONT), Oxford, UK). Raw reads were converted to FASTQ, aligned to reference sequences, and assembled into contigs. Multi-sequence alignments of the contigs were generated and used for cladistics analysis. Results: We sequenced full-length HIV-1 from the transcriptional start site to 39 LTR (100\% virion genome) in 3 out of 15 isolates (89.6, NLAD8, AD17), achieving majority coverage (defined as \&gt; 50\%) in another 7 out of 15 isolates. Inspection of NLAD8 sequence alignments revealed splicing or deletion signatures. Despite the strong 3′ bias, read coverage was sufficient to evaluate single-nucleotide variants (SNVs), insertions and deletions in 9 isolates, and to assemble HIV-1 genomes directly from viral RNA, achieving a maximum of 94\% assembly coverage for NLAD8. Phylogenetic relationships were maintained at the level of contigs, as well as individual reads. Conclusions: ONT native RNA sequencing performed as expected, covering full-length HIV-1 RNA without PCR or cDNA sequencing. Native single-molecule RNA sequencing supported previous models of HIV-1 replication, and samples exhibited strain-specific transcriptional signals. We propose Context Dependency Variant Classification to describe variants occurring in information-dense regions of HIV. These data provide a rich resource for emerging RNA modification detection schemes. Future work will expand HIV-1 transcript profiling to infection models and clinical samples.},

@article{germain_srna-mediated_2025,
 abstract = {Staphylococcus aureus is an opportunistic pathogen responsible for a wide range of diseases in humans. During infections, this bacterium is exposed to various stresses that target its cell wall, such as oxidative or acid environments as well as various cell wall-acting antimicrobials. Staphylococcus aureus has effective regulatory systems for responding to environmental stresses, enabling the expression of factors necessary for its survival. Bacterial small RNAs (sRNAs) play a crucial role in this adaptation process. In this study, we show that RsaOI, an S. aureus sRNA, accumulates under acid stress conditions. This response is mediated via the two-component system VraSR, which is associated with the cell wall damage response. As a component of the VraSR regulon, RsaOI contributes to the survival of S. aureus under acid stress and affects its susceptibility to glycopeptide antibiotics. Our findings reveal that RsaOI targets the lacABCDFEG operon, which encodes components of tagatose pathway, a unique mechanism responsible for galactose metabolism in S. aureus. By antisense base pairing near the ribosome binding site of lacD, RsaOI inhibits the expression of this gene, encoding tagatose-6-phosphate aldolase. This regulation disrupts the tagatose pathway, impairing galactose utilization in S. aureus. These findings highlight the role of RsaOI in the mediation between cell wall stress responses and a specific metabolic pathway.},

In birds, manipulation of the genome is hindered by the inaccessibility of the one-cell embryo. During embryonic development, avian primordial germ cells (PGCs) migrate through the bloodstream and reach the gonadal anlage, where they develop into mature germ cells. Here, we explored the use of PGCs to produce transgenic offspring in the zebra finch, which is a major animal model for sexual brain differentiation, vocal learning, and vocal communication. Zebra finch PGCs (zfPGCs) obtained from embryonic blood significantly proliferated when cultured in an optimized culture medium and conserved the expression of germ and stem cell markers. Transduction of cultured zfPGCs with lentiviral vectors was highly efficient, leading to strong expression of the enhanced green fluorescent protein. Transduced zfPGCs were injected into the host embryo and transgenic songbirds were successfully generated.},

@article{ghiglione_outbreak_2025,
 abstract = {\textbf{Background:} During the COVID-19 pandemic, the emergence of multidrug-resistant (MDR) pathogens, driven by heightened antibiotic usage and device-associated infections, has posed significant challenges to healthcare. This study reports an outbreak of \textit{Proteus mirabilis} producing NDM-5 and CTX-M-15 β-lactamases in a hospital in Buenos Aires, Argentina, from October 2020 to April 2021. To our knowledge, this represents the first documented outbreak of NDM-5-producing \textit{P. mirabilis} in the country. \textbf{Methods:} A total of 82 isolates were recovered from 40 patients, with 41.5\% from blood cultures and 18.3\% from respiratory and urinary samples, among others. Antimicrobial susceptibility testing, PCR-based methods, and MALDI-TOF MS cluster analysis were conducted. Whole genome sequencing (WGS) was performed to characterize the MLST, resistome and plasmid content. Biofilm formation assays and in vitro rifampicin susceptibility tests were also conducted. \textbf{Result:} Most isolates exhibited resistance to carbapenems, cephalosporins, aminoglycosides, and fluoroquinolones, while retaining susceptibility to aztreonam. Genetic analysis confirmed the co-presence of the \textit{bla}$_{\textrm{NDM-5}}$ and \textit{bla}$_{\textrm{CTX-M-15}}$ genes. Clonal relationships was supported by PCR-based typing and MALDI-TOF MS cluster analysis. WGS revealed a resistome comprising 25 resistance genes, including \textit{rmtB} and both β-lactamases, as well as the presence of an incomplete IncQ1 replicon associated with multiple resistance determinants. MLST classified this clone as belonging to ST135. Despite the biofilm-forming capacity observed across strains, rifampicin demonstrated potential for disrupting established biofilms at concentrations ≥32 µg/mL in vitro. The MDR profile of the outbreak strain significantly limited therapeutic options. \textbf{Conclusions:} This study highlights the growing threat of NDM-producing \textit{P. mirabilis} in Argentina. The absence of surveillance cultures from the index case limits insights into the outbreak's origin. These findings underscore the importance of integrating genomic surveillance into infection control protocols to mitigate the spread of MDR pathogens.},

Moreover, the gene rearrangement of subfamily Panchaetothripinae of family Thripidae is also studied.

Further, codon based comparative analysis depicted the existence of natural selection pressure on all the PCGs in all the subfamilies of family Thripidae. The phylogenetic analyses, using the Bayesian inference (BI) and Maximum likelihood (ML) supported the monophyly of two suborders and family Phlaeothripidae. The family Thripidae is recovered as paraphyletic and subfamily Panchaetothripinae is in sister relationship with family Aeolothripidae and Stenurothripidae rather than the other subfamilies of family Thripidae. The gene order of the order Thysanoptera is highly rearranged, while few members of the subfamily Panchaetothripinae showed similar gene order to family Stenurothripidae. Therefore, this study suggests that the phylogenetic relationship between the subfamily Panchaetothripinae and other families is uncertain, necessitating a whole genome-based study to clarify the position of Panchaetothripinae within the suborder Terebrantia.},

 abstract = {Nonstop extension mutations, a.k.a. stop-lost or stop-loss mutations, convert a stop codon into a sense codon resulting in translation into the 3’ untranslated region until the next in-frame stop codon, thereby extending the C-terminus of a protein. In cancer, only nonstop mutations in SMAD4 have been functionally characterized, while the impact of other nonstop mutations remain unknown. Here, we exploit our pan-cancer NonStopDB dataset and test all 2335 C-terminal extensions arising from somatic nonstop mutations in cancer for their impact on protein expression. In a high-throughput screen, 56.1\% of the extensions effectively reduce protein abundance. Extensions of multiple tumor suppressor genes like PTEN, APC, B2M, CASP8, CDKN1B and MLH1 are effective and validated for their suppressive impact. Importantly, the effective extensions possess a higher hydrophobicity than the neutral extensions linking C-terminal hydrophobicity with protein destabilization. Analyzing the proteomes of eleven different species reveals conserved patterns of amino acid distribution in the C-terminal regions of all proteins compared to the proteomes like an enrichment of lysine and arginine and a depletion of glycine, leucine, valine and isoleucine across species and kingdoms. These evolutionary selection patterns are disrupted in the cancer-derived effective nonstop extensions.},

 abstract = {Background: This study aimed to evaluate the prognostic value of a non-invasive sampling procedure based on 13-gene DNA methylation analysis in the follow-up of patients previously treated for oral squamous cell carcinoma (OSCC). Methods: The study population included 49 consecutive patients treated for OSCC. Oral brushing sample collection was performed at two different times: before any cancer treatment in the tumor mass and during patient follow-up almost 6 months after OSCC treatment, within the regenerative area after OSCC resection. Each sample was considered positive or negative in relation to a predefined cut-off value. Results: Before any cancer treatment, 47/49 specimens exceeded the score and were considered as positive. Six months after OSCC resection, 16/49 specimens also had positive scores in the samples collected from the regenerative area. During the follow-up period, 7/49 patients developed locoregional relapse: 6/7 patients had a positive score in the regenerative area after OSCC resection. The presence of a positive score after oral cancer treatment was the most powerful variable related to the appearance of locoregional relapse. Conclusion: 13-gene DNA methylation analysis by oral brushing may have a clinical application as a prognostic non-invasive tool in the follow-up of patients surgically treated for OSCC.},

In this study, we analyzed a ceftazidime/avibactam (CAZ-AVI)-resistant K. pneumoniae isolate obtained from a patient previously exposed to CAZ-AVI expressing a novel K. pneumoniae carbapenemase (KPC)-3 variant. Methods: Antimicrobial susceptibility testing was performed using reference broth microdilution. Whole-genome sequencing (WGS) was performed using Illumina and Nanopore Technologies.

WGS revealed that the KP\_RM\_1 genome is composed of a single chromosome of 5 Mbp and five circular plasmids. Further analysis showed the presence of novel blaKPC-216 located on a 72 kb plasmid. KPC-216 differs from KPC-3 by a Lysin (K) insertion at position 168 (+K168). Conclusions: We report the identification of a new KPC-3 variant associated with CAZ-AVI resistance. The KPC variants associated with CAZ-AVI resistance should be determined to promptly inform clinicians and start the appropriate antimicrobial therapy.},

 abstract = {Polyethylene terephthalate (PET) is a widely used plastic polymer, and its microplastics pose significant threats to ecosystems. One promising approach to addressing this issue is biodegradation using microbial consortia. This study implemented a two-stage biodegradation strategy using microbial consortia to degrade PET microplastics and detoxify their by-products. In the first stage, a bacterial/fungal consortium dominated by Ralstonia, Bradyrhizobium, Exophiala, and Vanrija achieved a 28 ± 2 \% degradation efficiency over 60 days, converting PET into medium-chain alkanes (as confirmed by GC-MS analysis), with a maximum CO2 evolution rate of 722 ppm. Physical and chemical analyses, including Scanning electron microscopy (SEM), Brunauer-Emmett-Teller (BET) analysis, and Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy, revealed structural destruction, mesopore formation, and ester bond breakage of the microplastics. Toxicity assessment of by-products showed a 40 \% reduction in human endothelial cell viability, necessitating further detoxification. The second stage utilized a bacterial consortium dominated by Ochrobacterium and Achromobacter, which effectively reduced toxic by-products to 20 \%. This study emphasizes the dual focus on efficient PET degradation and the safe decomposition of harmful by-products, showcasing the potential of sequential biodegradation strategies as sustainable solutions for microplastic pollution.},

We observed layer-specific changes in the dendritic complexity and spine density of CA1 pyramidal cells. In addition, transcriptomic analysis highlighted significant changes in the expression of synapse-related genes across development. Finally, we were able to identify significant changes in the expression levels of latrophilin 2, a postsynaptic guidance molecule known for its role in the entorhinal-hippocampal connectivity. These findings were supported by changes in the synaptic proteomic content in CA1 stratum lacunosum-moleculare.

 abstract = {Cell fate decisions during early B cell activation determine the outcome of responses to pathogens and vaccines. We examined the early B cell response to T-dependent antigen in mice by single-cell RNA sequencing. Early after immunization, a homogeneous population of activated precursors (APs) gave rise to a transient wave of plasmablasts (PBs), followed a day later by the emergence of germinal center B cells (GCBCs). Most APs rapidly exited the cell cycle, giving rise to non-GC-derived early memory B cells (eMBCs) that retained an AP-like transcriptional profile. Rapid decline of antigen availability controlled these events; provision of excess antigen precluded cell cycle exit and induced a new wave of PBs. Fate mapping revealed a prominent contribution of eMBCs to the MBC pool. Quiescent cells with an MBC phenotype dominated the early response to immunization in primates. A reservoir of APs/eMBCs may enable rapid readjustment of the immune response when failure to contain a threat is manifested by increased antigen availability.},

@article{gobel_myc_2023,
 abstract = {Group 3 medulloblastoma is one of the most aggressive types of childhood brain tumors. Roughly 30\% of cases carry genetic alterations in MYC, SMARCA4, or both genes combined. While overexpression of MYC has previously been shown to drive medulloblastoma formation in mice, the functional significance of SMARCA4 mutations and their suitability as a therapeutic target remain largely unclear. To address this issue, we combined overexpression of MYC with a loss of SMARCA4 in granule cell precursors. Both alterations did not increase proliferation of granule cell precursors in vitro. However, combined MYC overexpression and SMARCA4 loss successfully induced tumor formation in vivo after orthotopic transplantation in recipient mice. Resulting tumors displayed anaplastic histology and exclusively consisted of SMARCA4-negative cells although a mixture of recombined and non-recombined cells was injected. These observations provide first evidence for a tumor-promoting role of a SMARCA4 deficiency in the development of medulloblastoma. In comparing the transcriptome of tumors to the cells of origin and an established Sonic Hedgehog medulloblastoma model, we gathered first hints on deregulated gene expression that could be specifically involved in SMARCA4/MYC driven tumorigenesis. Finally, an integration of RNA sequencing and DNA methylation data of murine tumors with human samples revealed a high resemblance to human Group 3 medulloblastoma on the molecular level. Altogether, the development of SMARCA4-deficient medulloblastomas in mice paves the way to deciphering the role of frequently occurring SMARCA4 alterations in Group 3 medulloblastoma with the perspective to explore targeted therapeutic options.},

 abstract = {Bioinformatics is fundamental to biomedical sciences, but its mastery presents a steep learning curve for bench biologists and clinicians. Learning to code while analyzing data is difficult. The curve may be flattened by separating these two aspects and providing intermediate steps for budding bioinformaticians. Single-cell analysis is in great demand from biologists and biomedical scientists, as evidenced by the proliferation of training events, materials, and collaborative global efforts like the Human Cell Atlas. However, iterative analyses lacking reinstantiation, coupled with unstandardized pipelines, have made effective single-cell training a moving target.To address these challenges, we present a Multi-Interface Galaxy Hands-on Training Suite (MIGHTS) for single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) analysis, which offers parallel analytical methods using a graphical interface (buttons) or code. With clear, interoperable materials, MIGHTS facilitates smooth transitions between environments. Bridging the biologist–programmer gap, MIGHTS emphasizes interdisciplinary communication for effective learning at all levels. Real-world data analysis in MIGHTS promotes critical thinking and best practices, while FAIR data principles ensure validation of results. MIGHTS is freely available, hosted on the Galaxy Training Network, and leverages Galaxy interfaces for analyses in both settings. Given the ongoing popularity of Python-based (Scanpy) and R-based (Seurat \&amp; Monocle) scRNA-seq analyses, MIGHTS enables analyses using both.MIGHTS consists of 11 tutorials, including recordings, slide decks, and interactive visualizations, and a demonstrated track record of sustainability via regular updates and community collaborations. Parallel pathways in MIGHTS enable concurrent training of scientists at any programming level, addressing the heterogeneous needs of novice bioinformaticians.},

The application of omics technologies—mainly studying nucleic acids—has significantly improved MB classification and stratification, but treatment options are still unsatisfactory. The proteome and their N-glycans hold the potential to discover clinically relevant phenotypes and targetable pathways. We compile a harmonized proteome dataset of 167 MBs and integrate findings with DNA methylome, transcriptome and N-glycome data. We show six proteome MB subtypes, that can be assigned to two main molecular programs: transcription/translation (pSHHt, pWNT and pG3myc), and synapses/immunological processes (pSHHs, pG3 and pG4). Multiomic analysis reveals different conservation levels of proteome features across MB subtypes at the DNA methylome level. Aggressive pGroup3myc MBs and favorable pWNT MBs are most similar in cluster hierarchies concerning overall proteome patterns but show different protein abundances of the vincristine resistance-associated multiprotein complex TriC/CCT and of N-glycan turnover-associated factors. The N-glycome reflects proteome subtypes and complex-bisecting N-glycans characterize pGroup3myc tumors. Our results shed light on targetable alterations in MB and set a foundation for potential immunotherapies targeting glycan structures.},

Cathodes were characterized through composition, pH, specific surface area and infrared spectroscopy; then production of electricity, methane (CH4), and volatile fatty acids (VFAs) from carbon dioxide (CO2) was described, and finally the microbial community was explored through 16S rRNA gene sequencing. WC-based electrodes performed better than OW-based ones. WC (200 ± 25 mV) generated twice the amount of electricity compared to OW (100 ± 10 mV) in MFC modality. In MEC modality, WC achieved both higher CH4 production and concentration (3.6 ± 0.7 mL per day, 73.2 ± 3.9 \% v/v, respectively) than OW (3.0 ± 0.3 mL per day, 70 ± 8 \% v/v, respectively). In MES modality, WC produced ten times more acetic acid (0.3 ± 0.13 g L−1 per day) than OW (0.03 ± 0.04 g L−1 per day). The better performance of the WC-biochar cathode was attributed to its higher Brunauer–Emmett–Teller (BET) value and its carbonaceous graphite-like structure. NGS analysis highlighted the presence of specific genera of microorganisms leading to the differential functioning of the systems.},

These interactions are common and finely tuned tritrophic relationships amongst host plants, powdery mildews, and Ampelomyces mycoparasites wherever these organisms co-occur in the field. Selected Ampelomyces strains have already been developed as biocontrol agents of powdery mildew infections of some crops. In Australia, their study has received little attention so far. Only a single Ampelomyces strain, included in a whole-genome sequencing (WGS) project, was known from this continent. Here, we report the isolation of 20 more Ampelomyces strains from eight powdery mildew species in Australia. Multi-locus phylogenetic network analyses of all the 21 Australian Ampelomyces strains carried out in combination with 32 reference strains from overseas revealed that the Australian strains belonged to four molecular taxonomic units (MOTUs). All those MOTUs were delimited earlier based on Ampelomyces strains isolated in Europe, North America, and elsewhere. Based on the phylogenetic analyses, two Australian strains belonging to different MOTUs were selected for WGS. Long-read (MinION) and short-read (Illumina) technologies were used to provide genome assemblies with high completeness. Both assemblies have a bipartite structure, i.e., consisted of AT-rich, gene-sparse regions interspersed with GC-balanced, gene-rich regions. These new high-quality assemblies and evidence-based annotations are important resources for future analyses of mycoparasitic interactions to disentangle molecular mechanisms underlying mycoparasitism, possible new biocontrol applications, and naturally occurring tritrophic relationships.},

Growing demand for healthy diets and changing consumer eating habits have led to an increase in the market size of dietary supplements and functional foods. This increase has a direct impact on the supply of antioxidants and other valuable molecules known for their health benefits. Due to the increasing demand for these pigments, there is a need for new bioproducers. In this study, we present a novel production platform based on metabolically engineered plant-cultured cells. The carotenoid pigments, Astaxanthin and Canthaxanthin, were synthesized using non-photosynthetic Medicago cells in suspension culture. Agrobacterium-mediated transformation was used to introduce a single β-carotene ketolase gene from the marine bacterium Brevundimonas sp. into Medicago cells, generating several stable metabolically engineered lines. HPLC and transcriptomic analyses were performed, showing significant variability in carotenoid content and gene expression, suggesting that intracellular responses influence production levels. The highest-producing line yielded 178.3 μg g−1 DW of Astaxanthin and 37.7 μg g−1 DW of Canthaxanthin. This plant-based platform will contribute to a more sustainable food and feed industry, addressing the growing challenges of global food production and consumption.},

Based on TurboID, we developed PLAMseq (Proximity Labelled Affinity-purified Mass spectrometry plus sequencing), which enables, in the same workflow, to identify the genomic loci and the interacting proteome of a protein of interest. Moreover, PLAMseq can also be applied to specifically map protein interactions across the genome or to specifically detect proteins which are ubiquitin(-like) modified. After a short biotin pulse, DNA-protein crosslinks are induced by formaldehyde and the interactors of a protein of interest, together with their associated DNA sequences, are purified simultaneously and identified by mass spectrometry-based proteomics and Next Generation Sequencing, respectively. To validate PLAMseq, we performed the proteo-genomic characterization of two proteins which genomic loci are very well characterized, namely, RNA polymerase II and CTCF, with excellent robustness and reproducibility. Next, we applied PLAMseq to characterize Histone H1 SUMOylation, a histone post-translational modification which study has remained elusive due to the lack of specific reagents. We found that SETDB1 binds to SUMOylated histone H1.2 and H1.4 and, accordingly, SUMOylated histone H1 colocalizes with H3K9me3 at repetitive regions of the genome.},

 abstract = {Hyaloperonospora arabidopsidis (Hpa) is an obligately biotrophic downy mildew that is routinely cultured on Arabidopsis thaliana hosts that harbour complex microbiomes. We hypothesized that the culturing procedure proliferates Hpa-associated microbiota (HAM) in addition to the pathogen and exploited this model system to investigate which microorganisms consistently associate with Hpa. Using amplicon sequencing, we found nine bacterial sequence variants that are shared between at least three out of four Hpa cultures in the Netherlands and Germany and comprise 34\% of the phyllosphere community of the infected plants. Whole-genome sequencing showed that representative HAM bacterial isolates from these distinct Hpa cultures are isogenic and that an additional seven published Hpa metagenomes contain numerous sequences of the HAM. Although we showed that HAM benefit from Hpa infection, HAM negatively affect Hpa spore formation. Moreover, we show that pathogen-infected plants can selectively recruit HAM to both their roots and shoots and form a soil-borne infection-associated microbiome that helps resist the pathogen. Understanding the mechanisms by which infection-associated microbiomes are formed might enable breeding of crop varieties that select for protective microbiomes.},

 abstract = {Forensic trace contextualization, i.e., assessing information beyond who deposited a biological stain, has become an issue of great and steadily growing importance in forensic genetic casework and research. The human transcriptome encodes a wide variety of information and thus has received increasing interest for the identification of biomarkers for different aspects of forensic trace contextualization over the past years. Massively parallel sequencing of reverse-transcribed RNA (“RNA sequencing”) has emerged as the gold standard technology to characterize the transcriptome in its entirety and identify RNA markers showing significant expression differences not only between different forensically relevant body fluids but also within a single body fluid between forensically relevant conditions of interest. Here, we analyze the quality and composition of four RNA sequencing datasets (whole transcriptome as well as miRNA sequencing) from two different research projects (the RNAgE project and the TrACES project), aiming at identifying contextualizing forensic biomarker from the forensically relevant body fluid saliva. We describe and characterize challenges of RNA sequencing of saliva samples arising from the presence of oral bacteria, the heterogeneity of sample composition, and the confounding factor of degradation. Based on these observations, we formulate recommendations that might help to improve RNA biomarker discovery from the challenging but forensically relevant body fluid saliva.},

@article{goshi_direct_2025,
 abstract = {Cognitive impairment is one of the many symptoms reported by individuals suffering from long-COVID and other post-viral infection disorders such as myalgic encephalomyelitis/chronic fatigue syndrome (ME/CFS). A common factor among these conditions is a sustained immune response and increased levels of inflammatory cytokines. Tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-α) and interleukin-6 (IL-6) are two such cytokines that are elevated in patients diagnosed with long-COVID and ME/CFS. In this study, we characterized the changes in neural functionality, secreted cytokine profiles, and gene expression in co-cultures of human iPSC-derived neurons and primary astrocytes in response to prolonged exposure to TNF-α and IL-6. We found that exposure to TNF-α produced both a concentration-independent and concentration-dependent response in neural activity. Burst duration was significantly reduced within a few days of exposure regardless of concentration (1 pg/mL – 100 ng/mL) but returned to baseline after 7 days. Treatment with low concentrations of TNF-α (e.g., 1 and 25 pg/mL) did not lead to changes in the secreted cytokine profile or gene expression but still resulted in significant changes to electrophysiological features such as interspike interval and burst duration. Conversely, treatment with high concentrations of TNF-α (e.g., 10 and 100 ng/mL) led to reduced spiking activity, which may be correlated to changes in neural health, gene expression, and increases in inflammatory cytokine secretion (e.g., IL-1β, IL-4, and CXCL-10) that were observed at higher TNF-α concentrations. Prolonged exposure to IL-6 led to changes in bursting features, with significant reduction in the number of spikes in bursts across a wide range of treatment concentrations (i.e., 1 pg/mL–10 ng/mL). In combination, the addition of IL-6 appears to counteract the changes to neural function induced by low concentrations of TNF-α, while at high concentrations of TNF-α the addition of IL-6 had little to no effect. Conversely, the changes to electrophysiological features induced by IL-6 were lost when the cultures were co-stimulated with TNF-α regardless of the concentration, suggesting that TNF-α may play a more pronounced role in altering neural function. These results indicate that increased concentrations of key inflammatory cytokines associated with long-COVID can directly impact neural function and may be a component of the cognitive impairment associated with long-COVID and other post-viral infection disorders.},

 abstract = {Genome-scale metabolic modeling is widely used to study the impact of metabolism on the phenotype of different organisms. While substrate modeling reflects the potential distribution of carbon and other chemical elements within the model, the additional use of omics data, e.g., transcriptome, has implications when researching the genotype-phenotype responses to environmental changes. Several algorithms for transcriptome analysis using genome-scale metabolic modeling have been proposed. Still, they are restricted to specific objectives and conditions and lack flexibility, have software compatibility issues, and require advanced user skills. We classified previously published algorithms, summarized transcriptome pre-processing, integration, and analysis methods, and implemented them in the newly developed transcriptome analysis tool \textit{IgemRNA}, which (1) has a user-friendly graphical interface, (2) tackles compatibility issues by combining previous data input and pre-processing algorithms in MATLAB, and (3) introduces novel algorithms for the automatic comparison of different transcriptome datasets with or without Cobra Toolbox 3.0 optimization algorithms. We used publicly available transcriptome datasets from Saccharomyces cerevisiae BY4741 and H4-S47D strains for validation. We found that \textit{IgemRNA} provides a means for transcriptome and environmental data validation on biochemical network topology since the biomass function varies for different phenotypes. Our tool can detect problematic reaction constraints.},

@article{greenfield_modification_2020,
 abstract = {Dysregulation of epigenetic processes is increasingly understood to play a role in the pathogenesis of myeloproliferative neoplasms (MPNs). Ruxolitinib, a JAK/STAT inhibitor, has proved a useful addition to the therapeutic arsenal for these disorders, but has limited disease modifying activity. We determined the effect of JAK inhibition on the histone landscape of MPN cells in cell line models of MPNs and validated using samples from the MAJIC randomised clinical trial of ruxolitinib in polycythaemia vera and essential thrombocythaemia. We demonstrated an epigenetic modifying effect of ruxolitinib using a histone modification assay. The majority of 21 histone H3 modifications were upregulated, with H3K27me3 and H3K36me2 significant in the combined cell line results. Chromatin immunoprecipitation and sequencing (CHIP-seq) for three marks of interest, H3K4me1, H3K4me3 and H3K27ac, was consistent with the histone modification assay showing a significant increase in H3K4me3 and H3K27ac peaks at promoter regions, both marks of active transcription. In contrast, RNA sequencing demonstrates a coordinated reduction in gene expression in a number of cell pathways including PI3K-AKT signalling, transcriptional misregulation in cancer and JAK-STAT signalling in spite of these histone changes. This highlights the complex mechanisms of transcriptional control within the cells which was reflected in analysis of the histone landscape in patient samples following ruxolitinib treatment.},

@article{gress_prostaglandin_2024,
 abstract = {Increased production of Prostaglandin D2 (PGD2) is linked to development and progression of asthma and allergy. PGD2 is rapidly degraded to its metabolites, which initiate type 2 innate lymphoid cells (ILC2) migration and IL-5/IL-13 cytokine secretion in a PGD2 receptor 2 (DP2)-dependent manner. Blockade of DP2 has shown therapeutic benefit in subsets of asthma patients. Cellular mechanisms of ILC2 activity in response to PGD2 and its metabolites are still unclear. We hypothesized that ILC2 respond non-uniformly to PGD2 metabolites. ILC2s were isolated from peripheral blood of patients with atopic asthma. ILC2s were stimulated with PGD2 and four PGD2 metabolites (Δ12-PGJ2, Δ12-PGD2, 15-deoxyΔ12,14-PGD2, 9α,11β-PGF2) with or without the selective DP2 antagonist fevipiprant. Total RNA was sequenced, and differentially expressed genes (DEG) were identified by DeSeq2. Differential gene expression analysis revealed an upregulation of pro-inflammatory DEGs in ILC2s stimulated with PGD2 (14 DEGs), Δ12-PGD2 (27 DEGs), 15-deoxyΔ12,14-PGD2 (56 DEGs) and Δ12-PGJ2 (136 DEGs), but not with 9α,11β-PGF2. Common upregulated DEGs were i.e. ARG2, SLC43A2, LAYN, IGFLR1, or EPHX2. Inhibition of DP2 via fevipiprant mainly resulted in downregulation of pro-inflammatory genes such as DUSP4, SPRED2, DUSP6, ETV1, ASB2, CD38, ADGRG1, DDIT4, TRPM2, or CD69. DEGs were related to migration and various immune response-relevant pathways such as “chemokine (C-C motif) ligand 4 production”, “cell migration”, “interleukin-13 production”, “regulation of receptor signaling pathway via JAK-STAT”, or “lymphocyte apoptotic process”, underlining the pro-inflammatory effects of PGD2 metabolite-induced immune responses in ILC2s as well as the anti-inflammatory effects of DP2 inhibition via fevipiprant. Furthermore, PGD2 and metabolites showed distinct profiles in ILC2 activation. Overall, these results expand our understanding of DP2 initiated ILC2 activity.},

 abstract = {Segmental instillation of lipopolysaccharide (LPS) by bronchoscopy safely induces transient airway inflammation in human lungs. This model enables investigation of pulmonary inflammatory mechanisms as well as pharmacodynamic analysis of investigational drugs. The aim of this work was to describe the transcriptomic profile of human segmental LPS challenge with contextualization to major respiratory diseases. Pre-challenge bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) fluid and biopsies were sampled from 28 smoking, healthy participants, followed by segmental instillation of LPS and saline as control. Twenty-four hours post instillation, BAL and biopsies were collected from challenged lung segments. Total RNA of cells from BAL and biopsy samples were sequenced and analysed for differentially expressed genes (DEGs). After challenge with LPS compared with saline, 6316 DEGs were upregulated and 241 were downregulated in BAL, but only one DEG was downregulated in biopsy samples. Upregulated DEGs in BAL were related to molecular functions such as “Inflammatory response” or “chemokine receptor activity”, and upregulated pro-inflammatory pathways such as “Wnt-"/“Ras-"/“JAK-STAT” “-signaling pathway”. Furthermore, the segmental LPS challenge model resembled aspects of the five most prevalent respiratory diseases chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), asthma, pneumonia, tuberculosis and lung cancer and featured similarities with acute exacerbations in COPD (AECOPD) and community-acquired pneumonia. Overall, our study provides extensive information about the transcriptomic profile from BAL cells and mucosal biopsies following LPS challenge in healthy smokers. It expands the knowledge about the LPS challenge model providing potential overlap with respiratory diseases in general and infection-triggered respiratory insults such as AECOPD in particular.},

No comparable activity is observed with cytarabine, a cytidine analogue without DNA-hypomethylating properties. As evidence exists for compounding hypermethylation and gene silencing of hemizygous tumor suppressor genes (TSG), we thus hypothesized that this effect may preferentially be reversed by the HMAs decitabine and azacitidine. An unbiased RNA-sequencing approach was developed to interrogate decitabine-induced transcriptome changes in AML cell lines with or without a deletion of chromosomes 7q, 5q or 17p. HMA treatment preferentially upregulated several hemizygous TSG in this genomic region, significantly derepressing endogenous retrovirus (ERV)3–1, with promoter demethylation, enhanced chromatin accessibility, and increased H3K4me3 levels. Decitabine globally reactivated multiple transposable elements, with activation of the dsRNA sensor RIG-I and interferon regulatory factor (IRF)7. Induction of ERV3–1 and RIG-I mRNA was also observed during decitabine treatment in vivo in serially sorted peripheral blood AML blasts. In patient-derived monosomal karyotype AML murine xenografts, decitabine treatment resulted in superior survival rates compared with cytarabine. Collectively, these data demonstrate preferential gene derepression and ERV reactivation in AML with chromosomal deletions, providing a mechanistic explanation that supports the clinical observation of superiority of HMA over cytarabine in this difficult-to-treat patient group.
Significance: These findings unravel the molecular mechanism underlying the intriguing clinical activity of HMAs in AML/MDS patients with chromosome 7 deletions and other monosomal karyotypes.See related commentary by O'Hagan et al., p. 813

Induction of ERV3–1 and RIG-I mRNA was also observed during decitabine treatment in vivo in serially sorted peripheral blood AML blasts. In patient-derived monosomal karyotype AML murine xenografts, decitabine treatment resulted in superior survival rates compared with cytarabine. Collectively, these data demonstrate preferential gene derepression and ERV reactivation in AML with chromosomal deletions, providing a mechanistic explanation that supports the clinical observation of superiority of HMA over cytarabine in this difficult-to-treat patient group.
Significance: These findings unravel the molecular mechanism underlying the intriguing clinical activity of HMAs in AML/MDS patients with chromosome 7 deletions and other monosomal karyotypes.See related commentary by O'Hagan et al., p. 813},

Currently, the retrieval approaches are mainly based on text matching between natural language queries and the descriptions of candidate workflows. Notably, the workflow structure also provides essential semantics, but the challenge lies in effectively matching these two pieces of heterogeneous information. To address this issue, we propose a Proxy-based Scientific workflow retrieval approach, ProSwats, which selects a workflow as the Proxy for each text query to bridge the gap between textual and structural semantics. ProSwats consists of two stages: workflow pre-selection based on text similarity and workflow ranking based on a matching degree prediction model. The textual and structural features are integrated by the proxy in this model, which is used to predict and rank the degree of semantic matching between the user query and candidate workflows. Crucially, ProSwats incorporates a confidence-aware learning mechanism to adapt to the varying reliability of proxies, enhancing generalizability. Extensive experimental results on two real-world datasets demonstrate that ProSwats outperforms state-of-the-art methods with statistical significance.},

@inproceedings{gu_swarm_2023,
 abstract = {Discovering and recommending scientific workflow fragments that can be reused or repurposed from public repositories is becoming increasingly significant in the scientific domain. Although popular fragment discovery strategies can identify frequent and similar fragments, they lack the ability to further mine pattern semantics. Moreover, current recommendation approaches are primarily based on text matching between natural language queries and the descriptions of candidate fragments, neglecting crucial structural information that conveys their functions. To address these challenges, this paper designs SWARM, a scientific workflow fragments recommendation approach via contrastive learning and semantic matching. SWARM consists of two phases: fragment discovery based on frequent subgraph mining and a contrastive semantics extraction model, and fragment recommendation based on a matching degree prediction model incorporating a pre-trained fragment encoder, which is used to predict and rank the degree of semantic matching between the user query and candidate fragments. SWARM aims to extract and integrate textual and structural semantics from fragments to discover and recommend them. The experimental results on commonly-used real-world datasets show that SWARM outperforms state-of-the-art methods with statistical significance.},

 abstract = {Finding scientific workflow models that can be reused or repurposed from public repositories is becoming popular in the scientific community. Currently, the retrieval approaches for workflow models are mainly based on text matching between queries and the descriptions of models. However, the structure information of these models, which includes inputs, outputs, data processing modules, and datalinks connecting modules, expresses their functions in a more detailed manner, yet this information is not used in the model retrieval process. Therefore, we propose a two-stage framework for Scientific WOrkflow Retrieval by learning Textual and Structural semantics (SWORTS). The framework comprises a workflow pre-selection step and a workflow ranking step. Specifically, we use text similarity approaches to quickly identify candidate workflow models in the first step. Then, a hierarchy-based matching degree prediction model, which takes both textual and structural features into account, is trained to predict and rank the degree of semantic matching between requirement specifications and candidate workflows. The experiment results on real-world datasets demonstrate that SWORTS achieves the best performance with relatively balanced effectiveness and efficiency among state-of-the-art methods.},

The outer surface of CPs and ILFs is demarcated by a poorly characterized population of CD11c+ cells. Using genome-wide single-cell transcriptional profiling of intestinal mononuclear phagocytes and multidimensional flow cytometry, we found that CP- and ILF-associated CD11c+ cells were a transcriptionally distinct subset of intestinal cDCs, which we term CIA-DCs. CIA-DCs required programming by CP- and ILF-resident CCR6+ ILC3 via lymphotoxin-β receptor signaling in cDCs. CIA-DCs differentially expressed genes associated with immunoregulation and were the major cellular source of IL-22 binding protein (IL-22BP) at steady state. Mice lacking CIA-DC-derived IL-22BP exhibited diminished expression of epithelial lipid transporters, reduced lipid resorption, and changes in body fat homeostasis. Our findings provide insight into the design principles of an immunoregulatory checkpoint controlling nutrient absorption.},

The yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae is considered as a host of choice for cloning and engineering whole or partial genomes from viruses, bacteria, and algae. Several methods are now available to perform these manipulations, each with its own limitations. In order to extend the range of yeast cloning strategies, a new approach combining two already described methods, Fusion cloning and CReasPy-Cloning, was developed. The CReasPy-Fusion method allows the simultaneous cloning and engineering of megabase-sized genomes in yeast by the fusion of bacterial cells with yeast spheroplasts carrying the CRISPR-Cas9 system. With this new approach, we demonstrate the feasibility of cloning and editing whole genomes from several Mycoplasma species belonging to different phylogenetic groups. We also show that CReasPy-Fusion allows the capture of large genome fragments with high efficacy, resulting in the successful cloning of selected loci in yeast. We finally identify bacterial nuclease encoding genes as barriers for CReasPy-Fusion by showing that their removal from the donor genome improves the cloning efficacy.},

 abstract = {Methicillin-resistant \textit{Staphylococcus aureus} (MRSA) is one of the major human pathogens. It could carry numerous resistance genes and virulence factors in its genome, some of which are related to the severity of the infection. An observational, descriptive, cross-sectional study was designed to molecularly analyze MRSA isolates that cause invasive infections in Paraguayan children from 2009 to 2013. Ten representative MRSA isolates of the main clonal complex identified were analyzed with short-read paired-end sequencing and assessed for the virulome, resistome, and phylogenetic relationships. All the genetically linked MRSA isolates were recovered from diverse clinical sources, patients, and hospitals at broad gap periods. The pan-genomic analysis of these clones revealed three major and different clonal complexes (CC30, CC5, and CC8), each composed of clones closely related to each other. The CC30 genomes prove to be a successful clone, strongly installed and disseminated throughout our country, and closely related to other CC30 public genomes from the region and the world. The CC5 shows the highest genetic variability, and the CC8 carried the complete arginine catabolic mobile element (ACME), closely related to the USA300-NAE-ACME+, identified as the major cause of CA-MRSA infections in North America. Multiple virulence and resistance genes were identified for the first time in this study, highlighting the complex virulence profiles of MRSA circulating in the country.

In this study, the pan-genomic analysis of the most representative MRSA clones circulating in invasive infection in Paraguayan children over the years 2009-2013, such as the CC30-ST30-IV, CC5-ST5-IV, and CC8-ST8-IV, was carried out to evaluate their genetic diversity, their repertoire of virulence factors, and antimicrobial resistance determinants. This revealed multiple virulence and resistance genes, highlighting the complex virulence profiles of MRSA circulating in Paraguay. Our work is the first genomic study of MRSA in Paraguay and will contribute to the development of genomic surveillance in the region and our understanding of the global epidemiology of this pathogen.},

In this study, we investigated the presence of T. halophilus in human samples using a polyphasic approach including scanning electron microscopy, molecular biology methods and microbial culture. This unique investigation yielded the unprecedented presence of T. halophilus in human feces samples, thus enriching the repertoire of halophilic microorganisms colonizing the human gastrointestinal tract with the isolation and culture of T. halophilus for the first time in humans. Using the E-test strips, the MIC was assessed for T. halophilus strain CSURQ6002: rifampicin (MIC at 0.002 μg/mL), benzylpenicillin (MIC at 0.094 μg/mL), amoxicillin (MIC at 0.5 μg/mL), erythromycin (MIC at 2 μg/mL), clindamycin (MIC at 4 μg/mL), and vancomycin (MIC at 8 μg/mL). However, this strain showed a MIC up to 256 μg/mL for ciprofloxacin, fosfomycin, doxycyclin, imipenem, and colistin. In-silico profiling derived from whole genome sequencing (NCBI accession number: PRJNA780809), was confirmed.

 abstract = {RNA-sequencing (RNA-seq) analysis of gene expression and alternative splicing should be routine and robust but is often a bottleneck for biologists because of different and complex analysis programs and reliance on specialized bioinformatics skills. We have developed the '3D RNA-seq' App, an R shiny App and web-based pipeline for the comprehensive analysis of RNA-seq data from any organism. It represents an easy-to-use, flexible and powerful tool for analysis of both gene and transcript-level gene expression to identify differential gene/transcript expression, differential alternative splicing and differential transcript usage (3D) as well as isoform switching from RNA-seq data. 3D RNA-seq integrates state-of-the-art differential expression analysis tools and adopts best practice for RNA-seq analysis. The program is designed to be run by biologists with minimal bioinformatics experience (or by bioinformaticians) allowing lab scientists to analyse their RNA-seq data. It achieves this by operating through a user-friendly graphical interface which automates the data flow through the programs in the pipeline. The comprehensive analysis performed by 3D RNA-seq is extremely rapid and accurate, can handle complex experimental designs, allows user setting of statistical parameters, visualizes the results through graphics and tables, and generates publication quality figures such as heat-maps, expression profiles and GO enrichment plots. The utility of 3D RNA-seq is illustrated by analysis of data from a time-series of cold-treated Arabidopsis plants and from dexamethasone-treated male and female mouse cortex and hypothalamus data identifying dexamethasone-induced sex- and brain region-specific differential gene expression and alternative splicing.},

 abstract = {{\textless}h4{\textgreater}Motivation{\textless}/h4{\textgreater}Mass spectrometry imaging (MSI) characterizes the molecular composition of tissues at spatial resolution, and has a strong potential for distinguishing tissue types, or disease states. This can be achieved by supervised classification, which takes as input MSI spectra, and assigns class labels to subtissue locations. Unfortunately, developing such classifiers is hindered by the limited availability of training sets with subtissue labels as the ground truth. Subtissue labeling is prohibitively expensive, and only rough annotations of the entire tissues are typically available. Classifiers trained on data with approximate labels have sub-optimal performance.{\textless}h4{\textgreater}Results{\textless}/h4{\textgreater}To alleviate this challenge, we contribute a semi-supervised approach mi-CNN. mi-CNN implements multiple instance learning with a convolutional neural network (CNN). The multiple instance aspect enables weak supervision from tissue-level annotations when classifying subtissue locations. The convolutional architecture of the CNN captures contextual dependencies between the spectral features. Evaluations on simulated and experimental datasets demonstrated that mi-CNN improved the subtissue classification as compared to traditional classifiers. We propose mi-CNN as an important step toward accurate subtissue classification in MSI, enabling rapid distinction between tissue types and disease states.{\textless}h4{\textgreater}Availability and implementation{\textless}/h4{\textgreater}The data and code are available at https://github.com/Vitek-Lab/mi-CNN\_MSI.},

@article{guo_mitogenome-based_2024,
 abstract = {Heptageniidae are known for their flat heads and bodies and are divided into three subfamilies. Despite the extensive diversity within this group and considerable efforts made to understand their evolutionary history, the internal classifications and origin time of Heptageniidae remains controversial. In this study, we newly sequenced 17 complete mitogenomes of Heptageniidae to reconstruct their phylogenetic positions within this family. Because of the ambiguous time of origin, our study also estimated the divergence time within Heptageniidae based on five fossil calibration points. The results of BI and ML trees all highly supported the monophyly of Heptageniidae and three subfamilies. The phylogenetic relationship of Rhithrogeninae + (Ecdyonurinae + Heptageniinae) was also recovered. The divergence time showed that Heptageniidae originated from 164.38 Mya (95\% HPD, 150.23–181.53 Mya) in the mid-Jurassic, and Rhithrogeninae originated from 95.54 Mya (95\% HPD, 73.86–120.19 Mya) in the mid-Cretaceous. Ecdyonurinae and Heptageniinae began to diverge at 90.08 Mya (95\% HPD, 68.81–113.16 Mya) in the middle Cretaceous. After morphological identification, analysis of the mitogenome’s composition, genetic distance calculation, phylogenetic analysis, and divergence time calculation, we suggest that two different populations of Epeorus montanus collected from Aksu, Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Region (40°16′ N, 80°26′ E) and Xinyuan, Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Region (43°20′ N, 83°43′ E) in China are cryptic species of E. montanus, but further detailed information on their morphological characteristics is needed to fully identify them.},

However, a vast chemical space of other DNA modifications remains to be explored for genome editing. Here we harness the bacterial antiphage toxin DarT2 to append ADP-ribosyl moieties to DNA, unlocking distinct editing outcomes in bacteria versus eukaryotes. Fusing an attenuated DarT2 to a Cas9 nickase, we program site-specific ADP-ribosylation of thymines within a target DNA sequence. In tested bacteria, targeting drives homologous recombination, offering flexible and scar-free genome editing without base replacement or counterselection. In tested yeast, plant and human cells, targeting drives substitution of the modified thymine to adenine or a mixture of adenine and cytosine with limited insertions or deletions, offering edits inaccessible to current base editors. Altogether, our approach, called append editing, leverages the addition of chemical moieties to DNA to expand current modalities for precision gene editing.},

 abstract = {Streptococcussuis is an important zoonotic pathogen that causes severe invasive disease in pigs and humans. Current methods for genome engineering of S. suis rely on the insertion of antibiotic resistance markers, which is time-consuming and labor-intensive and does not allow the precise introduction of small genomic mutations. Here we developed a system for CRISPR-based genome editing in S. suis, utilizing linear DNA fragments for homologous recombination (HR) and a plasmid-based negative selection system for bacteria not edited by HR. To enable the use of this system in other bacteria, we engineered a broad-host-range replicon in the CRISPR plasmid. We demonstrated the utility of this system to rapidly introduce multiple gene deletions in successive rounds of genome editing and to make precise nucleotide changes in essential genes. Furthermore, we characterized a mechanism by which S. suis can escape killing by a targeted Cas9-sgRNA complex in the absence of HR. A characteristic of this new mechanism is the presence of very slow-growing colonies in a persister-like state that may allow for DNA repair or the introduction of mutations, alleviating Cas9 pressure. This does not impact the utility of CRISPR-based genome editing because the escape colonies are easily distinguished from genetically edited clones due to their small colony size. Our CRISPR-based editing system is a valuable addition to the genetic toolbox for engineering of S. suis, as it accelerates the process of mutant construction and simplifies the removal of antibiotic markers between successive rounds of genome editing.},

Impaired regeneration and remodeling of mucociliary epithelia are associated with dysregulated Wnt/β-catenin signaling in chronic airway diseases, but underlying mechanisms remain elusive, and studies yield seemingly contradicting results. Employing the Xenopus mucociliary epidermis, the mouse airway, and human airway Basal cells, we characterize the evolutionarily conserved roles of Wnt/β-catenin signaling in vertebrates. In multiciliated cells, Wnt is required for cilia formation during differentiation. In Basal cells, Wnt prevents specification of epithelial cell types by activating ΔN-TP63, a master transcription factor, which is necessary and sufficient to mediate the Wnt-induced inhibition of specification and is required to retain Basal cells during development. Chronic Wnt activation leads to remodeling and Basal cell hyperplasia, which are reversible in vivo and in vitro, suggesting Wnt inhibition as a treatment option in chronic lung diseases. Our work provides important insights into mucociliary signaling, development, and disease.},

 abstract = {Acquired Immunodeficiency Syndrome (AIDS) is caused by Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV), and continues to be responsible for a substantial number of deaths worldwide each year. Development of a robust and efficient HIV-1 vaccine remains a critical priority. Structural analysis of viral proteins provides a foundational approach to designing peptide-based immunogenic vaccines. In the current experiment, we used computational prediction approaches alongside molecular docking and molecular dynamics (MD) simulations to identify potential epitopes within gp120 and Nef proteins. The selected co-epitopes were fused with the HBsAg-binding protein (SBP), a 344-amino acid protein previously identified in our laboratory through screening of a human liver cDNA expression library against HBsAg, to facilitate efficient delivery to and uptake by dendritic cells (DCs), thereby enhancing antigen (Ag) presentation. Flexible linkers are used to connect B cells, Helper T Lymphocytes (HTLs), and Cytotoxic T Lymphocytes (CTLs) in a sequential manner. The assembled vaccine construct comprises 757 amino acids, corresponding to a recombinant protein of 83.64 kDa molecular weight. Structural analysis through docking studies, MD simulations, and 3D structure validation revealed that the designed protein exhibits high structural stability and potential for interaction with Toll-like receptors (TLRs). These findings support the vaccine's ability to enhance cellular and humoral feedback, including the stimulation of T and B cells and induction of antibody (Ab) production. The results underscore the promise of this in silico designed co-epitope vaccine as a viable candidate for HIV-1 prevention and suggest that such constructs may serve as effective immunogens in future HIV-1 vaccine strategies.},

 abstract = {Increased life expectancy in modern society comes at the cost of age-associated disabilities and diseases. Aged brains not only show reduced excitability and plasticity, but also a decline in inhibition. Age-associated defects in inhibitory circuits likely contribute to cognitive decline and age-related disorders. Molecular mechanisms that exert epigenetic control of gene expression contribute to age-associated neuronal impairments. Both DNA methylation, mediated by DNA methyltransferases (DNMTs), and histone modifications maintain neuronal function throughout lifespan. Here we provide evidence that DNMT1 function is implicated in the age-related loss of cortical inhibitory interneurons. Dnmt1 deletion in parvalbumin-positive interneurons attenuates their age-related decline in the cerebral cortex. Moreover, DNMT1-deficient mice show improved somatomotor performance and reduced aging-associated transcriptional changes. A decline in the proteostasis network, responsible for the proper degradation and removal of defective proteins, is implicated in age- and disease- related neurodegeneration. Our data suggest that DNMT1 acts indirectly on interneuron survival in aged mice by modulating the proteostasis network during life-time.},

 abstract = {The nervous system undergoes dynamic structural remodeling to infiltrate cancerous tumors, contributing to their growth and progression. Emerging evidence indicates that neuroplasticity initiates early, with nerve terminals detecting and responding to tissue changes even during precancerous stages. Notably, dense sympathetic axon sprouting has been observed around pancreatic intraepithelial neoplasia (PanIN), a common precursor lesion to pancreatic cancer. However, the molecular signals driving this early neuroplasticity and its functional consequences remain poorly understood. Here, we identify the axon guidance molecule Netrin-1 as a key factor secreted by pancreatic cells within precursor lesions of pancreatic cancer. Netrin-1 promotes sympathetic axon growth and branching through its receptor, Deleted in Colorectal Cancer (DCC). Inhibition of Netrin-1 disrupts sympathetic axon remodeling while accelerating PanIN formation and progression, driven by increased precancerous cell proliferation. Furthermore, human pancreatic tissue analysis corroborates Netrin-1 expression in precursor lesions. These findings suggest that Netrin-1-driven sympathetic neuroplasticity plays a protective role in the precancerous microenvironment by modulating local cellular dynamics, providing insights into early cancer progression.},

 abstract = {Schwann cells (SC) are crucial for physiological impulse conduction in peripheral nerves. They produce myelin, provide axonal metabolic support, and contribute to reparatory processes after nerve injury. During aging, peripheral nerves acquire myelin structural anomalies and are characterized by a lower fraction of SC and a higher fraction of senescent cells. All these changes correlate with impaired electrical conduction and consequently altered function of target tissues including skeletal muscle weakness and cardiac arrhythmia. To characterize and compare cardiac and sciatic nerve SC, as well as to explore age-related differences in SC abundance and their properties, we analyzed two TdTomato reporter mouse strains to isolate Sox10 or Plp1 expressing SC. We performed RNA-sequencing on sorted TdTomato-positive cells from the heart and sciatic nerve and validated transcriptomic findings at the protein level using immunofluorescence. Our data reveal a pro-angiogenic profile in cardiac SC when compared to sciatic SC. In addition, higher levels of neural-death associated genes and lower gene and protein expression levels of the fatty acid co-transporter Fabp4/FABP4 are detected in cardiac SC from old compared to young mice, suggesting an aging-related impairment of fatty acid transport. Finally, sciatic SC activate collagen remodeling and increased pro-inflammatory signaling including TNFα. Thus, cardiac and musculoskeletal SC have different expression profiles, and undergo different changes during aging, which may contribute to impaired nerve function in both organ systems.},

Over 70\% of the samples were identified as Cryptosporidium parvum and 20\% as C. mortiferum, which had not been identified in Finland before. Two cases of Cryptosporidium hominis were identified from patients reported to have travelled outside Europe. The C. parvum subtype IIaA15G2R1 and the C. mortiferum subtype XIVaA20G2T1 were the most common subtypes identified. The interviewed C. mortiferum cases did not report shared exposures such as contact with wild rodents. In conclusion, C. parvum and C. mortiferum were the major causes of cryptosporidiosis in the five studied Finnish hospital districts.},

They were originally described as guides of post-transcriptional rRNA modifications, but emerging evidence suggests that snoRNAs fulfil an impressive variety of cellular functions. To reveal the true complexity of snoRNA-dependent functions, we need to catalogue first the complete repertoire of snoRNAs in a given cellular context. While the systematic mapping and characterization of “snoRNAomes” for some species have been described recently, this has not been done hitherto for the zebrafish (Danio rerio). Using size-fractionated RNA sequencing data from adult zebrafish tissues, we created an interactive “snoRNAome” database for this species. Our custom-designed analysis pipeline allowed us to identify with high-confidence 67 previously unannotated snoRNAs in the zebrafish genome, resulting in the most complete set of snoRNAs to date in this species. Reanalyzing multiple previously published datasets, we also provide evidence for the dynamic expression of some snoRNAs during the early stages of zebrafish development and tissue-specific expression patterns for others in adults. To facilitate further investigations into the functions of snoRNAs in zebrafish, we created a novel interactive database, snoDanio, which can be used to explore small RNA expression from transcriptomic data.},

@article{hamdi_wall-associated_2024,
 abstract = {The wall-associated kinase (WAK) and WAK-associated kinase-like (WAKL) genes belong to the major receptor-like kinase (RLK) gene family in plants. They are well-known as important candidates for directly transmitting extracellular signals to the cytoplasm by connecting the extracellular matrix with intracellular compartments. As a result, they participate in developmental processes as well as stress responses. Although genome-wide investigations of the WAK/WAKL gene family have been carried out in a number of plant species, little is known about the WAK/WAKL genes in sugar beet, Beta vulgaris subsp. vulgaris L. (BvWAK/WAKLs). In this study, we performed a computational large-scale characterization of the members of this gene family in sugar beet. Fifty five (55) sugar beet WAK/WAKL proteins exhibited a wide range of physicochemical properties. A total of 10 conserved motifs were identified from all BvWAK/WAKL proteins, of which 3 motifs could be used as specific motif markers for distinguishing BvWAKs from BvWAKLs. Gene structure analysis showed that most BvWAK/WAKL genes contained 3 or 4 exons with no obvious phylogenetic organization. Among BvWAK/WAKL genes, 50 were assigned to their chromosomal locations and shown to have expanded primarily through tandem duplication. Comparative phylogeny revealed that sugar beet WAK/WAKL genes were divided into six clades, and orthologous gene pairs were identified between sugar beet and its wild-related species, the sea beet (Beta vulgaris subsp. maritima L.), while B. maritima lineage-specific genes provided clues for the introduction of wild genes in sugar beet cultivars. The gene expression data analysis revealed that the BvWAK/WAKL genes of susceptible and resistant cultivars were differentially expressed in response to beet cyst nematode (BCN) infection, and that 13 BvWAK/WAKL genes were up-regulated only in the resistant cultivar, suggesting that they are potentially involved in the resistance of sugar beet against this nematode. For the first time in sugar beet, our study presents an extensive computation-based knowledge platform on WAK/WAKL gene family and provides candidate genes for deeper molecular investigation of their potential role in sugar cyst nematode resistance.},

 abstract = {Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis (ALS) or Motor Neurone Disease (MND) is a rapidly progressive and universally fatal neurological disorder. While some genetic causes have been discovered, much remains unknown, especially in different populations. Brachial monomelic amyotrophy (MMA) is a rare condition that mimics MND, but with a better prognosis. The genetic basis of MMA is currently unknown. In this study, DNA samples from the motor cortex of ALS cases were genotyped using whole genome sequencing (WGS) to compare results with those previously found in peripheral blood to screen for the presence of somatic mutations. Targeted sequencing of ALS genes in 28 Bangladeshi MND patients, including 11 MMA patients, was performed and compared with results from 8 UK MMA patients to establish if there was genetic link between the two diseases. Two SOD1 and a FUS mutation were found in the motor cortex samples but had previously been found in peripheral blood, not supporting the hypothesis of somatic heterogeneity. Screening of Bangladesh samples revealed 99 variants in 32 ALS risk genes, including pathogenic SOD1 mutations in 3 patients. Forty-three variants of conflicting interpretations (n=17), uncertain significance (n=12), risk factor (n=1) and unknown (n=13) were found in MMA patients, highlighting a shared genetic basis of MMA and MND. This is supported by the presence of TDP-43 pathology in UK MMA patient samples. The study discovered the genetic basis of MND in Bangladesh was overlapping but distinct compared to the UK, with no C9ORF72 mutations found in the Bangladeshi MND cases. Further work is needed to validate the variants currently designated as variants of uncertain significance in both MMA and MND patients.},

 abstract = {Methamphetamine (METH) use is frequent among people with HIV (PWH) and appears to increase the risk of neuronal injury and neurocognitive impairment (NCI). This study explored in vivo the effects of a 12 week (long-term), low-dose METH regimen in a transgenic animal model of neuroHIV with inducible expression of HIV-1 transactivator of transcription (Tat). Seven months after transient Tat induction and five months after METH exposure ended, we detected behavioral changes in the Barnes maze (BM) spatial memory task in the Tat and METH groups but not the combined Tat + METH group. The novel object recognition (NOR) task revealed that Tat extinguished discrimination in female animals with and without METH, although METH alone slightly improved NOR. In contrast, in males, Tat, METH, and Tat + METH all compromised NOR. Neuropathological examination detected sex-dependent and brain region-specific changes of pre-synaptic terminals, neurites, and activation of astrocytes and microglia. RNA-sequencing and quantitative reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction indicated that METH and Tat significantly altered gene expression, including factors linked to Alzheimer's disease-like NCI. In summary, chronic low-dose METH exerts long-term effects on behavioral function, neuropathology, and mRNA expression, and modulates the effects of Tat, suggesting sex-dependent and -independent mechanisms may converge in HIV brain injury and NCI.},

@article{hardtner_comparative_2023,
 abstract = {Background and aims
Atherosclerosis is a systemic and chronic inflammatory disease propagated by monocytes and macrophages. Yet, our knowledge on how transcriptome of these cells evolves in time and space is limited. We aimed at characterizing gene expression changes in site-specific macrophages and in circulating monocytes during the course of atherosclerosis.
Methods
We utilized apolipoprotein E-deficient mice undergoing one- and six-month high cholesterol diet to model early and advanced atherosclerosis. Aortic macrophages, peritoneal macrophages, and circulating monocytes from each mouse were subjected to bulk RNA-sequencing (RNA-seq). We constructed a comparative directory that profiles lesion- and disease stage-specific transcriptomic regulation of the three cell types in atherosclerosis. Lastly, the regulation of one gene, Gpnmb, whose expression positively correlated with atheroma growth, was validated using single-cell RNA-seq (scRNA-seq) of atheroma plaque from murine and human.
Results
The convergence of gene regulation between the three investigated cell types was surprisingly low. Overall 3245 differentially expressed genes were involved in the biological modulation of aortic macrophages, among which less than 1\% were commonly regulated by the remote monocytes/macrophages. Aortic macrophages regulated gene expression most actively during atheroma initiation. Through complementary interrogation of murine and human scRNA-seq datasets, we showcased the practicality of our directory, using the selected gene, Gpnmb, whose expression in aortic macrophages, and a subset of foamy macrophages in particular, strongly correlated with disease advancement during atherosclerosis initiation and progression.
Conclusions
Our study provides a unique toolset to explore gene regulation of macrophage-related biological processes in and outside the atheromatous plaque at early and advanced disease stages.},

For the first time, one hundred of the most submitted HIV subtypes and CRFs were retrieved from the LANL database, and the consensus sequences of the eleven HIV proteins were obtained to design vaccines for human and mouse hosts. By using various servers and filters, highly qualified B-cell epitopes, as well as HTL and CD8 + epitopes that were common between mouse and human alleles and were also located in the conserved domains of HIV proteins, were considered in the vaccine constructs. With 90\% coverage worldwide, the human vaccine model covers a diverse allelic population, making it widely available. Codon optimization and in silico cloning in prokaryotic and eukaryotic vectors guarantee high expression of the vaccine models in human and E. coli hosts. Molecular dynamics confirmed the stable interaction of the vaccine constructs with TLR3, TLR4, and TLR9, leading to a substantial immunogenic response to the designed vaccine. Vaccine models effectively target the humoral and cellular immune systems in humans and mice; however, experimental validation is needed to confirm these findings in silico.},

Due to the large phylogenetic distance to frequently used and easily genetically accessible model bacteria, most of the established genetic tools are not readily applicable for the here-investigated bacterial phylum. However, techniques for targeted gene inactivation and the introduction of heterologous genes are crucial to investigate the cell biology in the phylum in greater detail. In this study, the targeted genomic modification of model planctomycetes was achieved by enforcing two types of homologous recombination events: simultaneous double homologous recombination for the deletion of coding regions and insertion-duplication mutagenesis for the introduction of foreign DNA into the chromosome. Upon testing the expression of commonly used fluorescent protein-encoding genes, many of the tested native promoters could not be harnessed for variation of the expression strength. Since also four commonly used inducible gene expression systems did not work in the tested model strain Planctopirus limnophila, a native rhamnose-dependent transcriptional regulator/promoter pair was established as an inducible expression system. The expanded molecular toolbox will allow the future characterization of genome-encoded features in the understudied phylum.},

The P2X4 receptor (P2X4R) is a receptor for ATP that is highly expressed in many cancer types including PCa and is positively associated with tumorigenesis. To understand the role of P2X4R in PCa biology, particularly in PCa bone metastasis, P2X4R (P2RX4) was knocked out in human PCa cell line PC3 cells using the CRISPR/Cas9 system. Cell proliferation, apoptosis, migration, and invasion were examined using CyQUANT, Cell Meter Caspase 3/7, scratch and transwell assays. Results showed that depleting P2X4R significantly reduced cell proliferation and invasion and increased apoptosis compared to PC3 wildtype (WT) controls in vitro. To test their metastatic potential in vivo, PC3 WT and knock-out (KO) cells were intracardiacally injected into male BALB/c immunocompromised mice. Twenty-five days post-injection, there were no detectable tumours and associated bone destruction in the tibias of mice injected with KO cells, whereas tibias of over 50\% mice injected with WT cells were occupied by tumour cells, with significant bone destruction observed ex vivo using micro-CT. Furthermore, RNA-seq and bioinformatic analysis of P2X4R KO cells demonstrated links between P2X4R and PCa cell adhesion, and other key signalling such as Wnt signalling. These findings suggest that P2X4R is a potential therapeutic target for PCa metastasis, particularly bone metastasis.},

Genotyping the allelic combination in a fruit tree species is an essential procedure both for cross-based breeding and for establishing pollination requirements. Gel-based PCR techniques using primer pairs designed from conserved regions and spanning polymorphic intronic regions are traditionally used for this task. However, with the great advance of massive sequencing techniques and the lowering of sequencing costs, new genotyping-by-sequencing procedures are emerging. The alignment of resequenced individuals to reference genomes, commonly used for polymorphism detection, yields little or no coverage in the S-locus region due to high polymorphism between different alleles within the same species, and cannot be used for this purpose. Using the available sequences of Japanese plum S-loci concatenated in a rosary-like structure as synthetic reference sequence, we describe a procedure to accurately genotype resequenced individuals that allowed the analysis of the S-genotype in 88 Japanese plum cultivars, 74 of them are reported for the first time. In addition to unraveling two new S-alleles from published reference genomes, we identified at least two S-alleles in 74 cultivars. According to their S-allele composition, they were assigned to 22 incompatibility groups, including nine new incompatibility groups reported here for the first time (XXVII-XXXV).},

 abstract = {Oxygenic photosynthesis in streptophytic algae, such as Charophyceae, is often impeded by low CO2 levels in aquatic habitats. Consequently, many algal groups evolved a CO2-concentrating mechanism (CCM). However, its presence in Charophyceae remains controversial. To explore this, we analyzed the acclimation of photosynthesis, carbon isotope composition, and gene expression in Chara braunii under varying inorganic carbon (Ci) conditions. The photosynthetic activity changed complementarily under low- or high-Ci levels. Notably, the Ci compensation point of photosynthesis was significantly lower in thalli grown at ambient Ci than in elevated Ci. Correspondingly, the delta 13C levels were lower in thalli from high than low Ci. These results indicate that C. braunii performs a CCM under low Ci, which is suppressed under high Ci. Transcriptomic analyses of algae from different Ci cultivations provided insight into Ci-regulated genes and pointed to the possible association between carbonic anhydrases and aquaporins with the CCM. Collectively, our results indicate that C. braunii expresses a CCM allowing efficient use of CO2 and bicarbonate under limiting Ci conditions. A tentative scenario is provided summarizing the role of potential players in the CCM.},

 abstract = {Throughout the tree of life RNA-binding proteins play important roles, but they are poorly characterized in cyanobacteria. Overexpression of the predicted RNA-binding protein Ssr1238 in the cyanobacterium \textit{Synechocystis} 6803 for 24 h led to higher levels of RNase P RNA, tRNAs, and stress-related mRNAs. Co-immunoprecipitation of proteins followed by MS analysis and sequencing of UV crosslinked, co-immunoprecipitated RNA samples identified potential interaction partners of Ssr1238. The most enriched transcript was RNase P RNA, and RnpA, the protein component of RNase P, was among the most highly enriched proteins. A second highly enriched transcript is derived from gene \textit{ssl3177}, which encodes a central enzyme in cell wall remodelling during cell division. The data also showed a strong connection to the RNA maturation and modification system indicated by co-precipitation of RNA modifying enzymes, riboendonuclease E and enolase. Surprisingly, cyanophycin synthetase and urease were highly enriched as well. In conclusion, Ssr1238 specifically binds to two different transcripts and could be involved in the coordination of RNA maturation, translation, cell division, and aspects of nitrogen metabolism. Our results are consistent with recent findings that the \textit{B. subtilis} YlxR protein functions as an RNase P modulator (RnpM), extending its proposed role to the phylum cyanobacteria, and suggesting additional functionalities.},

 abstract = {A new level of viral complexity has emerged from the isolation of green algae-infecting chloroviruses from diverse aquatic environments around the world over the past few decades. This study focuses on describing and comparing the genomic features of gammachloroviruses, previously referred to as SAG-viruses. We present 24 novel isolates capable of forming plaques on lawns of Chlorella heliozoae SAG 3.83, including the first giant virus isolated from Greenland. Together with 13 previous isolates, these new viruses form a robust dataset that we used to investigate the genomic landscape and to test whether environmental conditions influence the species diversity of gammachloroviruses. Genome sizes range from 283 kbp to 385 kbp, with one new isolate having the smallest genome found in the genus Chlorovirus. Based on phylogenomics and global genome identity analysis, we defined 10 species of “Gammachlorovirus”, half of which are represented by a single isolate. We observed a high level of genome synteny, and the tRNA islets maintain a distinct interspecific pattern, although some notable variations are evident. Our analysis reveals an open pan-genome composed of 681 COGs, more than 30\% of which consist of uncharacterized genes, highlighting significant innovative genetic potential for these viruses. Our results suggest that the subgenus “Gammachlorovirus” exhibits the greatest genetic diversity among chloroviruses, with variability that is independent of geographic location. Overall, these findings underscore the considerable diversity within these ten newly defined species and the importance of isolating and characterizing chloroviruses from new locations worldwide to enhance our understanding of the ecology and evolution of this group of giant algal viruses.},

Its formation in Aquilaria species has been expedited using various induction techniques, revealing insights into factors affecting the chemical constituents of artificially induced agarwood. Building on this, our research delved into the potential of another Thymelaeaceae member, Gyrinops versteegii, as an alternate agarwood source. Inoculation of juvenile  G. versteegii stems with local strain of Fusarium solani successfully induced the production of sesquiterpenes and chromone compounds. On a molecular level, a de novo transcriptome reconstruction and analysis highlighted biological processes related to the plant-type hypersensitive response and DNA damage 2 days post-fungal inoculation. Notably, terpenoid biosynthesis was observed only in the group exposed to the fungus for an extended duration (28 days), where DNA damage response also played a pivotal role. Despite the inherent limitations of de novo transcriptome reconstruction, capturing only a few of sesquiterpenes biosynthesis-related genes, our findings underscore the potential of G. verteegii in producing high-quality agarwood. Future high-resolution transcriptome data could further elucidate this promising avenue.},

 abstract = {Biological control is emerging as a feasible alternative to chemical pesticides in agriculture. Measuring the microbial biocontrol agent (mBCA) populations in the environment is essential for an accurate risk assessment and to optimize the usage of an mBCA-based plant protection product. In this manuscript, a workflow to obtain a large number of qPCR markers suitable for robust strain-specific detection and quantification is presented. The workflow starts from whole genome sequencing data and consists on (i) identifying the strain-specific sequences, (ii) designing specific primer/probe sets for qPCR assays, and (iii) empirically verifying the performance of the assays. The first two stages involve exclusively computer work, but they are intended for researchers with little or no bioinformatic background: only knowledge of the BLAST suite tools and working with spreadsheets are required, and familiarity with the Galaxy environment and next-generation sequencing concepts are strongly advised. All bioinformatic work can be implemented using publically available resources and a regular desktop computer, no matter the operating system, connected to the Internet. The workflow was tested with 5 bacterial strains from different species under development as mBCAs, and yielded thousands of candidate markers and a triplex qPCR assay for each candidate mBCA. The qPCR assays were successfully tested in soils of different nature, water from different sources, and samples from different plant tissues. The mBCA detection limits and population dynamics in the different matrices are similar to those in qPCR assasys designed by other means. In summary a new accessible, amenable, cost-effective and robust, workflow to obtain a large number of strain-specific qPCR markers, is presented.},

 abstract = {We previously found that OsCUL3c is involved in the salt stress response. However, there are no definitive reports on the diversity of OsCUL3c in local Thai rice. In this study, we showed that the CUL3 group was clearly separated from the other CUL groups; next, we focused on OsCUL3c, the third CUL3 of the CUL3 family in rice, which is absent in Arabidopsis. A total of 111 SNPs and 28 indels over the OsCUL3c region, representing 79 haplotypes (haps), were found. Haplotyping revealed that group I (hap A and hap C) and group II (hap B1 and hap D) were different mutated variants, which showed their association with phenotypes under salt stress. These results were supported by cis-regulatory elements (CREs) and transcription factor binding sites (TFBSs) analyses. We found that LTR, MYC, [AP2; ERF], and NF-YB, which are related to salt stress, drought stress, and the response to abscisic acid (ABA), have distinct positions and numbers in the haplotypes of group I and group II. An RNA Seq analysis of the two predominant haplotypes from each group showed that the OsCUL3c expression of the group I representative was upregulated and that of group II was downregulated, which was confirmed by RT-qPCR. Promoter changes might affect the transcriptional responses to salt stress, leading to different regulatory mechanisms for the expression of different haplotypes. We speculate that OsCUL3c influences the regulation of salt-related responses, and haplotype variations play a role in this regulation.},

 abstract = {Chara braunii is a model for early land plant evolution and terrestrialization. Salt stress has a profound effect on water and ion transport activities, thereby interacting with many other processes, including inorganic carbon acquisition for photosynthesis. In this study, we analyzed the impact of salt stress (5 practical salt units, PSU) on the physiology and gene expression in C. braunii. Photosynthesis was only slightly affected 6 h after salt addition and returned to control levels after 48 h. Several organic compounds such as proline, glutamate, sucrose, and 2-aminobutyrate accumulated in salt-treated thalli and might contribute to osmotic potential acclimation, whereas the amount of K+ decreased. We quantified transcript levels for 17,387 genes, of which 95 were up-regulated and 44 down-regulated after salt addition. Genes encoding proteins of the functional groups ion/solute transport and cell wall synthesis/modulation were enriched among the up-regulated genes 24–48 h after salt stress, indicating their role in osmotic acclimation. However, a homolog to land plant ERD4 osmosensors was transiently upregulated after 6 h, and phylogenetic analyses suggested that these sensors evolved in Charophyceae. Down-regulated genes were mainly related to photosynthesis and carbon metabolism/fixation, consistent with the observed lowered growth after extended cultivation. The changed expression of genes encoding proteins for inorganic carbon acquisition might be related to the impact of salt on ionic relations and inorganic carbon uptake. The results indicate that C. braunii can tolerate enhanced salt concentrations in a defined acclimation process, including distinct gene expression changes to achieve new metabolic homeostasis.},

Together with the Zygnematophyceae and the Coleochaetophycae, the Charophyceae form a grade in which the Zygnematophyceae share a last common ancestor with land plants. The availability of genomic data, its short life cycle, and the ease of non-sterile cultivation in the laboratory have made the species Chara braunii an emerging model system for streptophyte terrestrialization and early land plant evolution. In this study, tissue containing nodal cells was prepared under the stereomicroscope, and an RNA-seq dataset was generated and compared to transcriptome data from whole plantlets. In both samples, transcript coverage was high for genes encoding ribosomal proteins and a homolog of the putative PAX3- and PAX7-binding protein 1. Gene ontology was used to classify the putative functions of the differently expressed genes. In the nodal cell sample, main upregulated molecular functions were related to protein, nucleic acid, ATP- and DNA binding. Looking at specific genes, several signaling-related genes and genes encoding sugar-metabolizing enzymes were found to be expressed at a higher level in the nodal cell sample, while photosynthesis-and chloroplast-related genes were expressed at a comparatively lower level. We detected the transcription of 21 different genes encoding DUF4360-containing cysteine-rich proteins. The data contribute to the growing understanding of Charophyceae developmental biology by providing a first insight into the transcriptome composition of Chara nodal cells.},

 abstract = {The adult mammalian heart consists of mononuclear and binuclear cardiomyocytes (CMs) with various ploidies. However, it remains unclear whether a variation in ploidy or number of nuclei is associated with distinct functions and injury responses in CMs, including regeneration. Therefore, we investigated transcriptomes and cellular as well as nuclear features of mononucleated and binucleated CMs in adult mouse hearts with and without injury. To be able to identify the role of ploidy we analyzed control and failing human ventricular CMs because human CMs show a larger and disease-sensitive degree of polyploidization. Using transgenic Myh6-H2BmCh to identify mononucleated and binucleated mouse CMs, we found that cellular volume and RNA content were similar in both. On average nuclei of mononuclear CMs showed a 2-fold higher ploidy, as compared to binuclear CMs indicating that most mononuclear CMs are tetraploid. After myocardial infarction mononucleated and binucleated CMs in the border zone of the lesion responded with hypertrophy and corresponding changes in gene expression, as well as a low level of induction of cell cycle gene expression. Human CMs allowed us to study a wide range of polyploidy spanning from 2n to 16n. Notably, basal as well as pathological gene expression signatures and programs in failing CMs proved to be independent of ploidy. In summary, gene expression profiles were induced in proximity to injury, but independent of number of nuclei or ploidy levels in CMs.},

 abstract = {Cryoturbated peat circles (pH 4) in the Eastern European Tundra harbor up to 2 mM pore water nitrate and emit the greenhouse gas N$_{\textrm{2}}$O like heavily fertilized agricultural soils in temperate regions. The main process yielding N$_{\textrm{2}}$O under oxygen limited conditions is denitrification, which is the sequential reduction of nitrate/nitrite to N$_{\textrm{2}}$O and/or N$_{\textrm{2}}$. N$_{\textrm{2}}$O reduction to N$_{\textrm{2}}$ is impaired by pH {\textless} 6 in classical model denitrifiers and many environments. Key microbes of peat circles are important but largely unknown catalysts for \textit{C}- and \textit{N}-cycling associated N$_{\textrm{2}}$O fluxes. Thus, we hypothesized that the peat circle community includes hitherto unknown taxa and is essentially unable to efficiently perform complete denitrification, i.e., reduce N$_{\textrm{2}}$O, due to a low \textit{in situ} pH. 16S rRNA analysis indicated a diverse active community primarily composed of the bacterial class-level taxa Alphaproteobacteria, Acidimicrobiia, Acidobacteria, Verrucomicrobiae, and Bacteroidia, as well as archaeal Nitrososphaeria. Euryarchaeota were not detected. $^{\textrm{13}}$C$_{\textrm{2}}$- and $^{\textrm{12}}$C$_{\textrm{2}}$-acetate supplemented anoxic microcosms with endogenous nitrate and acetylene at an \textit{in situ} near pH of 4 were used to assess acetate dependent carbon flow, denitrification and N$_{\textrm{2}}$O production. Initial nitrate and acetate were consumed within 6 and 11 days, respectively, and primarily converted to CO$_{\textrm{2}}$ and N$_{\textrm{2}}$, suggesting complete acetate fueled denitrification at acidic pH. Stable isotope probing coupled to 16S rRNA analysis via Illumina MiSeq amplicon sequencing identified acetate consuming key players of the family \textit{Burkholderiaceae} during complete denitrification correlating with \textit{Rhodanobacter} spp. The archaeal community consisted primarily of ammonia-oxidizing Archaea of Nitrososphaeraceae, and was stable during the incubation. The collective data indicate that peat circles (i) host acid-tolerant denitrifiers capable of complete denitrification at pH 4-5.5, (ii) other parameters like carbon availability rather than pH are possible reasons for high N$_{\textrm{2}}$O emissions \textit{in situ}, and (iii) \textit{Burkholderiaceae} are responsive key acetate assimilators co-occurring with \textit{Rhodanobacter} sp. during denitrification, suggesting both organisms being associated with acid-tolerant denitrification in peat circles.},

 abstract = {Balanced signal transduction is crucial in tissue patterning, particularly in the vasculature. Heterotopic ossification (HO) is tightly linked to vascularization with increased vessel number in hereditary forms of HO, such as Fibrodysplasia ossificans progressiva (FOP). FOP is caused by mutations in the BMP type I receptor ACVR1 leading to aberrant SMAD1/5 signaling in response to ActivinA. Whether observed vascular phenotype in human FOP lesions is connected to aberrant ActivinA signaling is unknown. Blocking of ActivinA prevents HO in FOP mice indicating a central role of the ligand in FOP. Here, we established a new FOP endothelial cell model generated from induced pluripotent stem cells (iECs) to study ActivinA signaling. FOP iECs recapitulate pathogenic ActivinA/SMAD1/5 signaling. Whole transcriptome analysis identified ActivinA mediated activation of the BMP/NOTCH pathway exclusively in FOP iECs, which was rescued to WT transcriptional levels by the drug candidate Saracatinib. We propose that ActivinA causes transcriptional pre-patterning of the FOP endothelium, which might contribute to differential vascularity in FOP lesions compared to non-hereditary HO.},

 abstract = {Background Reticulated platelets (RP) are the youngest circulating platelets in blood. An increased amount of this subpopulation is associated with higher cardiovascular risk and mortality. Objectives It is unknown to what extent intrinsic properties of RP contribute to their hyperreactive features. This study is the first providing a multifactorial approach based on ultrastructural, transcriptional, and functional analysis of RP compared to non-RP sorted by flow cytometry. Methods Reticulated platelets and non-RP were sorted after platelet staining with SYTO 13. Employing transmission electron microscopy, 1089 micrographs were analyzed for platelet size, amounts of intracellular structures, and anatomical surrogates indicating activation. Long and small RNA-sequencing (RNA-seq) were performed for analyzing differential gene expression. Functional analysis of P-selectin—an upregulated mRNA in RP—was performed in healthy subjects and patients on P2Y12-inhibitors. Results Electron micrographs uncovered distinct ultrastructural differences in RP versus non-RP. Cross sections were 1.9-fold larger in RP (P {\textless} .0001). Amounts of α-granules, dense granules, open canalicular system-openings, and mitochondria were increased in RP, which persisted after adjustment for platelet size. Long RNA-seq showed 1212 upregulated transcripts that are predominantly associated to platelet shape change, aggregation, and activation; 1264 mRNAs were downregulated in RP. Small RNA-seq did not reveal any differentially expressed transcripts. Functional analysis displayed higher P-selectin expression as compared to non-RP upon ADP- or TRAP-stimulation. Conclusions Our results demonstrate that altered intrinsic structural and molecular properties contribute to the hyperreactivity of RP. These properties and an increased amount of RP may account for the association with cardiovascular risk.},

This study aimed to characterize an APEC strain, HPVN24, isolated from diarrheic chickens at a farm in Hai Phong, Vietnam. The strain was investigated through phenotypic assays, antibiotic susceptibility profiling, and whole-genome sequencing using the Illumina platform. HPVN24 exhibited β-hemolytic activity and resistance to trimethoprim, ampicillin, and ciprofloxacin. Whole-genome analysis identified the strain as serotype O78:H9 and sequence type ST23, with a genome size of 5.05 Mb and a GC content of 50.57\%. Genome annotation revealed a wide repertoire of genes involved in metabolism, secretion systems, virulence, and biofilm formation. Virulence-associated genes included those related to adhesion, iron acquisition, hemolysin production, and stress response. Analysis predicted multidrug resistance to 18 antibiotic classes, with particularly strong resistance to fluoroquinolones. Phylogenetic comparison demonstrated that HPVN24 clustered closely with O78:H9 strains isolated from poultry in other regions, suggesting potential transmission across populations. These findings indicate that HPVN24 is a multidrug-resistant and highly virulent APEC strain linked to colibacillosis outbreaks in Vietnam and highlight the need for ongoing surveillance, judicious antibiotic usage, and alternative strategies to ensure poultry health and food safety.},

 abstract = {Pulmonary sarcoidosis is a complex inflammatory disease characterized by granulomas in the lung tissue, leading to breathing difficulties and chest pain. Its etiology remains not fully understood, with factors such as allergies, autoimmune responses and genetics playing a role. This study explores the potential of blood microbiome dysbiosis, defined as an imbalance in the microbial ecosystem, as a missing piece of the puzzle in understanding the etiology of the disease. Our objective was to apply a decision-tree supervised machine learning hierarchical model to distinguish potential patterns of microbiome dysbiosis in blood samples from patients with pulmonary sarcoidosis as compared to healthy age-matched controls. Blood microbiome analysis, being individually-specific and stable, offers a unique perspective. Utilizing 16S rRNA gene amplicon sequencing, we analyzed the blood microbiome composition characterized by non-normally distributed and sparse data. Because of the rarity of the disease in Bulgaria, we studied a relatively small patient group, n = 7. The findings were compared to 21 healthy age-matched controls. Bioinformatics and statistical analysis play a pivotal role in microbiome analysis, especially when discerning associations between taxonomic composition and disorders such as pulmonary sarcoidosis. By analyzing the microbial diversity, we identified alterations in the blood microbiome composition between healthy individuals and those with sarcoidosis, which potentially may trigger the disease. Advanced machine learning techniques provided additional power to the analysis, that might be overlooked by the usual group statistics, confirming the differentiation of the diversity within the studied microbiome.},

 abstract = {Epigenome editing is a promising technology, potentially allowing the stable reprogramming of gene expression profiles without alteration of the DNA sequence. Targeted DNA methylation has been successfully documented by many groups for silencing selected genes, but recent publications have raised concerns regarding its specificity. In the current work, we developed new EpiEditors for programmable DNA methylation in cells with a high efficiency and improved specificity. First, we demonstrated that the catalytically deactivated Cas9 protein (dCas9)-SunTag scaffold, which has been used earlier for signal amplification, can be combined with the DNMT3A-DNMT3L single-chain effector domain, allowing for a strong methylation at the target genomic locus. We demonstrated that off-target activity of this system is mainly due to untargeted freely diffusing DNMT3A-DNMT3L subunits. Therefore, we generated several DNMT3A-DNMT3L variants containing mutations in the DNMT3A part, which reduced their endogenous DNA binding. We analyzed the genome-wide DNA methylation of selected variants and confirmed a striking reduction of untargeted methylation, most pronounced for the R887E mutant. For all potential applications of targeted DNA methylation, the efficiency and specificity of the treatment are the key factors. By developing highly active targeted methylation systems with strongly improved specificity, our work contributes to future applications of this approach.},

 abstract = {In recent years, modern life sciences research underwent a rapid development driven mainly by the technical improvements in analytical areas leading to miniaturization, parallelization, and high throughput processing of biological samples. This has led to the generation of huge amounts of experimental data. To meet these rising demands, the German Network for Bioinformatics Infrastructure (de.NBI) was established in 2015 as a national bioinformatics consortium aiming to provide high quality bioinformatics services, comprehensive training, powerful computing capacities (de.NBI Cloud) as well as connections to the European Life Science Infrastructure ELIXIR, with the goal to assist researchers in exploring and exploiting data more effectively.
Since its foundation, de.NBI Cloud has formed the scientific and collaborative backbone for new major German initiatives like NFDI or EOSC-Life in the European sector of computational biosciences. Above all, the cooperation with various NFDI consortia such as NFDI4Biodiversity, DataPLANT, GHGA, FAIRagro or NFDI4Microbiota showcases the power, range and flexibility of the de.NBI Cloud, especially for the national life science community.
In conclusion, the de.NBI Cloud provides the ability to unlock the full potential of research data and enables easier collaboration across different ecosystems and research areas, which in turn enables scientists to innovate and scale-up their data-driven research, not only in the life and computational biosciences, but across the different science domains addressed by the NFDI.

 abstract = {Ribonucleases are crucial enzymes in RNA metabolism and post-transcriptional regulatory processes in bacteria. Cyanobacteria encode the two essential ribonucleases RNase E and RNase J. Cyanobacterial RNase E is shorter than homologues in other groups of bacteria and lacks both the chloroplast-specific N-terminal extension as well as the C-terminal domain typical for RNase E of enterobacteria. In order to investigate the function of RNase E in the model cyanobacterium Synechocystis sp. PCC 6803, we engineered a temperature-sensitive RNase E mutant by introducing two site-specific mutations, I65F and the spontaneously occurred V94A. This enabled us to perform RNA-seq after the transient inactivation of RNase E by a temperature shift (TIER-seq) and to map 1472 RNase-E-dependent cleavage sites. We inferred a dominating cleavage signature consisting of an adenine at the -3 and a uridine at the +2 position within a single-stranded segment of the RNA. The data identified mRNAs likely regulated jointly by RNase E and an sRNA and potential 3' end-derived sRNAs. Our findings substantiate the pivotal role of RNase E in post-transcriptional regulation and suggest the redundant or concerted action of RNase E and RNase J in cyanobacteria.},

 abstract = {Herpesviruses are large DNA viruses, which encode up to 300 different proteins including enzymes enabling efficient replication. Nevertheless, they depend on a multitude of host cell proteins for successful propagation. To uncover cellular host factors important for replication of pseudorabies virus (PrV), an alphaherpesvirus of swine, we performed an unbiased genome-wide CRISPR/Cas9 forward screen. To this end, a porcine CRISPR-knockout sgRNA library (SsCRISPRko.v1) targeting 20,598 genes was generated and used to transduce porcine kidney cells. Cells were then infected with either wildtype PrV (PrV-Ka) or a PrV mutant (PrV-gD$^{\textrm{-}}$Pass) lacking the receptor-binding protein gD, which regained infectivity after serial passaging in cell culture. While no cells survived infection with PrV-Ka, resistant cell colonies were observed after infection with PrV-gD$^{\textrm{-}}$Pass. In these cells, sphingomyelin synthase 1 (SMS1) was identified as the top hit candidate. Infection efficiency was reduced by up to 90\% for PrV-gD$^{\textrm{-}}$Pass in rabbit RK13-sgms1$_{\textrm{KO}}$ cells compared to wildtype cells accompanied by lower viral progeny titers. Exogenous expression of SMS1 partly reverted the entry defect of PrV-gD$^{\textrm{-}}$Pass. In contrast, infectivity of PrV-Ka was reduced by 50\% on the knockout cells, which could not be restored by exogenous expression of SMS1. These data suggest that SMS1 plays a pivotal role for PrV infection, when the gD-mediated entry pathway is blocked.},

 abstract = {The prevalence of \textit{Pseudomonas syringae} pv. \textit{porri} (Pspo) in Belgium continues to increase and sustainable treatments for this pathogen remain unavailable. A potentially attractive biocontrol strategy would be the application of bacteriophages. The ideal application strategy of phages in an agricultural setting remains unclear, especially in a field-based production such as for leek plants in Flanders. Therefore, more insight in bacteria-phage interaction is required, along with the evaluation of different application strategies. In this study, we further characterized the infection strategy of two Pspo phages, KIL3b and KIL5. We found that both phages recognize lipopolysaccharide (LPS) moieties on the surface of the bacterium. LPS is an important pathogenicity factor of Pspo. Our data also suggest that KIL5 requires an additional protein in the bacterial cytoplasmatic membrane to efficiently infect its host. Virulence tests showed that this protein also contributes to Pspo virulence. Furthermore, a cocktail of both phages was applied in a seed bioassay. A combination of KIL3b and KIL5 reduced the bacterial concentration 100-fold. However, in vitro Pspo resistance against phage infection developed quite rapidly. However, the impact of this phage resistance might be mitigated as is suggested by the fact that those resistance mutations preferably occur in genes involved in LPS metabolism, and that the virulence of those mutants is possibly reduced. Our data suggest that the phage cocktail has promising potential to lower the prevalence of Pspo and to be integrated in a pest management strategy. Targeted research is needed to further explore the applicability of the phages in combination with other disease control strategies.},

The resulting mitogenome is 15,784 base pairs in length and has a GC content of 29.05\%. The nucleotide composition of this mitogenome is similar to that of other insect mitogenomes, with A, T, C, and G nucleotides comprising 39.2\%, 31.7\%, 19.6\%, and 9.5\% of the mitogenome, respectively. The gene organization of the A. domesticus mitogenome is identical to that of other cricket species. The mitogenome consists of 37 genes, including 13 protein-coding genes, 22 tRNA genes, and two rRNA genes. The congruence between PCA and Bayesian evolutionary tree analysis in clustering the divergent A. domesticus sequences highlights these genomes as candidates for further study to elucidate their distinct features and evolutionary history.},

 abstract = {The parasitic protozoan Entamoeba histolytica secretes extracellular vesicles (EVs), but so far little is known about their function in the interaction with the host immune system. Infection with E. histolytica trophozoites can lead to formation of amebic liver abscesses (ALAs), in which pro-inflammatory immune responses of Ly6Chi monocytes contribute to liver damage. Men exhibit a more severe pathology as the result of higher monocyte recruitment and a stronger immune response. To investigate the role of EVs and pathogenicity in the host immune response, we studied the effect of EVs secreted by low pathogenic EhA1 and highly pathogenic EhB2 amebae on monocytes. Size and quantity of isolated EVs from both clones were similar. However, they differed in their proteome and miRNA cargo, providing insight into factors potentially involved in amebic pathogenicity. In addition, EVs were enriched in proteins with signaling peptides compared with the total protein content of trophozoites. Exposure to EVs from both clones induced monocyte activation and a pro-inflammatory immune response as evidenced by increased surface presentation of the activation marker CD38 and upregulated gene expression of key signaling pathways (including NF-κB, IL-17 and TNF signaling). The release of pro-inflammatory cytokines was increased in EV-stimulated monocytes and more so in male- than in female-derived cells. While EhA1 EV stimulation caused elevated myeloperoxidase (MPO) release by both monocytes and neutrophils, EhB2 EV stimulation did not, indicating the protective role of MPO during amebiasis. Collectively, our results suggest that parasite-released EVs contribute to the male-biased immunopathology mediated by pro-inflammatory monocytes during ALA formation.},

@phdthesis{honecker_extracellular_2023,
 abstract = {Infection with the protozoan parasite Entamoeba histolytica (E. histolytica) is the cause of amebiasis. While most intestinal infections remain asymptomatic, a minority result in invasive disease. Invasive amebiasis, particularly amebic liver abscess (ALA) formation, occurs predominantly in adult men. An underlying immunopathology, crucially mediated by pro-inflammatory Ly6Chi monocytes, is known to contribute to liver damage in the murine model for the disease and differs between males and females. The mechanisms behind the switch from asymptomatic colonization to parasite invasion are incompletely understood to date. In order to investigate the interaction of the parasite with the host immune system, extracellular vesicles (EVs) as communicators between host and parasite were the focus of this study. EVs are membranous vesicles released by cells into their environment that contain protein, lipids, micro RNAs (miRNAs), and other types of cargo. They are involved in intercellular communication and pathogen-derived EVs have been demonstrated to modulate the host immune response in the context of a variety of infectious diseases. E. histolytica EVs and their effects on primary murine monocytes in vitro were studied here. 

EVs were isolated from amebic clones of differing pathogenicity (low pathogenic A1 and highly pathogenic B2) and characterized with regard to their size, as well as protein and miRNA content. Mass spectrometry and miRNA sequencing revealed differences in the respective cargo between EVs of the two clones that may play a role in pathogenicity. Analysis of the proteome obtained by mass spectrometry showed that E. histolytica EVs contained known pathogenicity factors (such as galactose/N-acetylgalactosamine (Gal/GalNac) lectin and the cysteine peptidase (CP) EhCP-A5) and were enriched in transmembrane and signaling proteins. Furthermore, de novo miRNA prediction revealed novel mature E. histolytica miRNAs that were present in EVs. Stimulation of male and female primary murine monocytes with EVs in vitro resulted in a proinflammatory response independent of pathogenicity of the corresponding amebic clone. This was characterized by an increase in the secretion of pro-inflammatory cytokines TNFa, IL-1b, IL-6, and IL-12p40, as well as the chemokines CCL3, CXCL1, and CXCL10, which was partially ablated upon heat inactivation of B2 but not A1 EVs. In addition, EV-stimulated monocytes expressed higher levels of the activation marker CD38 on their surface compared with negative controls. Transcriptome analysis revealed that EV stimulation resulted in activation of key immune pathways, including TLR, TNF, and NF-kB signaling in both male and female monocytes. While the gene expression patterns induced by EV stimulation were similar between male and female monocytes, some sex-specific differences could be detected, for example in the expression of Lhfpl2. Stimulation with A1 EVs triggered increased secretion of the granular enzyme myeloperoxidase by monocytes, an effect not observed after B2 EV stimulation. The same was observed in peripheral neutrophils. 

In summary, it was shown that A1 and B2 clones of E. histolytica release EVs containing immunogenic molecules that activate male and female monocytes, resulting in a pro-inflammatory phenotype.},

 abstract = {This investigation employed computational methodologies to assess the therapeutic potential of derivatives (1–16) of pyridoxal isonicotinoyl hydrazone (PIH) as potential treatments for tuberculosis. Various computational techniques, including molecular dynamics simulation, molecular docking, density functional theory, and global chemical descriptors, were employed to analyze the interactions between the ligands and target proteins. Docking results indicated that ligands 6, 7, 8, and rifampin exhibited binding affinities of −8.4, −7.4, −9.2, and − 7.2 kcal mol−1, respectively, against mycobacterium tuberculosis enoyl acyl carrier protein reductase (INHA), with ligand 8 demonstrating superior inhibition. Molecular dynamics (MD) simulations were utilized to assess the stability of protein-ligand interactions. Remarkably, the Root Mean Square Deviation (RMSD) of the INHA-ligand 8 complex remained minimal, with peak values at .40, .56, .37, and .50 nm at temperatures of 300, 305, 310, and 320 K, respectively. This suggests superior stability compared to the reference drug rifampin and INHA complex, which exhibited an RMSD range of .2 to .8 nm at 300 K. Furthermore, analysis using Frontier Molecular Orbital (FMO) revealed that the Egap value of ligand 8 (4.407 eV) is lower than all the reference drugs except rifampin. This comprehensive theoretical analysis positions ligand 8 as a promising candidate for anti-tuberculosis drug development, underscoring the need for further exploration through in vitro and in vivo studies.},

 abstract = {Heat stress in poultry houses, especially in warm areas, is one of the main environmental factors that restrict the growth of broilers or laying performance of layers, suppresses the immune system, and deteriorates egg quality and feed conversion ratio. The molecular mechanisms underlying the response of chicken to acute heat stress (AHS) have not been comprehensively elucidated. Therefore, the main object of the current work was to investigate the liver gene expression profile of chickens under AHS in comparison with their corresponding control groups, using four RNA-seq datasets. The meta-analysis, GO and KEGG pathway enrichment, WGCNA, machine-learning, and eGWAS analyses were performed. The results revealed 77 meta-genes that were mainly related to protein biosynthesis, protein folding, and protein transport between cellular organelles. In other words, under AHS, the expression of genes involving in the structure of rough reticulum membrane and in the process of protein folding was adversely influenced. In addition, genes related to biological processes such as “response to unfolded proteins,” “response to reticulum stress” and “ERAD pathway” were differentially regulated. We introduce here a couple of genes such as HSPA5, SSR1, SDF2L1, and SEC23B, as the most significantly differentiated under AHS, which could be used as bio-signatures of AHS. Besides the mentioned genes, the main findings of the current work may shed light to the identification of the effects of AHS on gene expression profiling of domestic chicken as well as the adaptive response of chicken to environmental stresses.},

Using publically available acute heat stress (AHS)-related RNA-seq data, we discovered novel lncRNAs and tested their association with AHS along with {\textasciitilde} 8800 known lncRNAs and {\textasciitilde} 28,000 mRNA transcripts. Our pipeline discovered a total of 145 potentially novel-lncRNAs. One of them (Fishcomb\_p-value = 0.06) along with another novel transcript (annotated as protein-coding; Fishcomb\_p-value = 0.03) were identified as significantly associated with AHS. We found five  known-lncRNAs and 134 mRNAs transcripts that were significantly associated with AHS. Four novel lncRNAs interact cis-regulated with 12 mRNA transcripts and are targeted by 11 miRNAs. Also six meta-lncRNAs associate with 134 meta-mRNAs through trans-acting co-expression, each targeted by 15 and 216 miRNAs, respectively. Three of the known-lncRNAs significantly co-expressed with almost 97 of the significant mRNAs (Pearson correlation p-value {\textless} 0.05). We report the mentioned three known-lncRNAs (ENSGALT00000099876, ENSGALT00000107573, and ENSGALT00000106323) as the most, significantly regulatory elements of AHS in chicken. It can be concluded that in order to alleviate the adverse effects of AHS on chicken, the manipulation of the three regulatory lncRNAs could lead to a more desirable result than the manipulation of the most significant mRNAs.},

 abstract = {Objectives
The emergence of metallo-beta-lactamases (MBLs) within the Klebsiella oxytoca complex (CRKO) poses a significant challenge in Taiwan, with so far incomplete characterization of species distribution and carbapenemase variants. This study aimed to elucidate the diversity, variants, and clinical presentations of CRKO isolates collected from 2013 to 2022.
Methods
We analyzed production of carbapenemases by the modified carbapenem inhibitory method (mCIM) and the NG testTM CARBA-5. Confirmation of five common carbapenemases and multilocus sequence typing were determined by polymerase chain reaction and sequencing. Nanopore whole-genome sequencing was used for the species differentiation and plasmids analysis. We also evaluated the clinical characteristics of the CRKO-infected patients.
Results
Three species were identified: K. michiganensis (n = 102), K. pasteurii (n = 13), and K. oxytoca (n = 3). A majority of isolates (91.5\%, n = 108) harbored at least one MBL gene, including blaVIM-1 (n = 56), blaIMP-8 (n = 26), and blaNDM-1 (n = 19), with six isolates carrying dual carbapenemase genes. The blaNDM-1 and blaIMP-8 genes were located on IncFII(Yp) and IncA/C2 plasmids, respectively. Notably, 34.7\% of isolates carried kleboxymycin gene clusters (KGC). Using CLSI and EUCAST criteria, 92.4\% and 82.4\% of isolates, respectively, were susceptible to cefiderocol. Among 92 infected patients, the 30-day mortality rate was 21.7\%, associated with female gender, higher Charlson Comorbidity Index, higher Pitt bacteremia scores, presence of bacteremia, and inversely associated with KGC.
Conclusion
The high prevalence of CRKO carrying MBLs and the recent surge of the ST27-blaNDM-1 genotype, poses significant treatment challenges and underscores the urgent need for enhanced surveillance in Taiwan.},

 abstract = {Background
Single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) rs1347093 shows statistically significant association with lung cancer risk, but there is no further rs1347093 expression quantitative trait loci (eQTL) effect information. SNP rs1347093 is located in microRNA-216/-217 (miR-216/-217) locus. In addition, miR-216/-217 have pancreas-enriched expressions. In this study, we examined a potential miR-216/-217 promoter region, and investigated the effect of rs1347093-A allele on the miR-216/-217 promoter activity.
Methods
Bioinformatics analysis, quantitative real-time PCR, luciferase reporter assay, Western blotting, and cell counting kit-8 (CCK-8) assay were performed.
Results
The miR-216/-217 expressions are down-regulated in pancreatic cancer. In pancreatic cancer patients carrying the rs1347093-A allele, miR-216/-217 expressions were more largely suppressed. We identified a potential promoter region in miR-216/-217 locus and further showed that rs1347093-A allele resulted in significantly reduced promoter activity in pancreatic cancer cells, which could be mediated by MEF2C activities. In terms of mechanism in the pathogenesis of pancreatic cancer, miR-216b-5p expression was down-regulated, thereby preventing it from interacting with beclin-1 mRNA while promoting the survival of pancreatic cancer cells.
Conclusions
This study may reveal the biological relevance underlying rs1347093-A allele with an increase in pancreatic cancer risk. SNP rs1347093 could be meaningful as a novel biomarker for pancreatic cancer risk.},

MHZ9 is localized in RNA processing bodies. The C-terminal domain of MHZ9 interacts with OsEIN2, a central regulator of rice ethylene signaling, and the N-terminal domain directly binds to the OsEBF1/2 mRNAs for translational inhibition, allowing accumulation of transcription factor OsEIL1 to activate the downstream signaling. RNA-IP seq and CLIP-seq analyses reveal that MHZ9 associates with hundreds of RNAs. Ribo-seq analysis indicates that MHZ9 is required for the regulation of {\textasciitilde} 90\% of genes translationally affected by ethylene.

Here, we present cleavage under Dynamic targets and Tagmentation (DynaTag), enabling robust mapping of TF-DNA interactions using a physiological salt solution during sample preparation. DynaTag uncovers occupancy alterations for 15 TFs in stem cell and cancer tissue models. We highlight changes in TF-DNA binding for NANOG, MYC, and OCT4, during stem-cell differentiation, at both bulk and single-cell resolutions. DynaTag surpasses CUT\&RUN and ChIP-seq in signal-to-background ratio and resolution. Furthermore, using tumours of a small cell lung cancer model derived from a single female donor, DynaTag reveals increased chromatin occupancy of FOXA1, MYC, and the mutant p53 R248Q at enriched gene pathways (e.g. epithelial-mesenchymal transition), following chemotherapy treatment. Collectively, we believe that DynaTag represents a significant technological advancement, facilitating precise characterization of TF landscapes across diverse biological systems and complex models.},

@article{huszarik_external_2023,
 abstract = {DNA metabarcoding is increasingly used to analyze the diet of arthropods, including spiders. However, high sensitivity to DNA contamination makes it difficult to apply to organisms obtained from mass-sampling methods such as pitfall traps. An alternative is to hand-sample spiders, but it is unclear how effectively this prevents external contamination, especially with new knowledge showing the wide spread of eDNA in the environment. Protocols using bleach to remove external DNA have been tested on several invertebrates, though testing with both mass-sampling methods and spiders is lacking. Here, we used wolf spiders (Lycosidae) to assess the risk of external DNA contamination from pitfall trapping and hand sampling, and the efficacy of bleach decontamination. We first conducted a contamination experiment where we placed spiders in pitfall traps containing trapping medium and a nonprey insect species to simulate external DNA contamination. We also compared sampling methods by collecting spiders using pitfall traps and hand sampling. Spiders from the contamination experiment and sampling method comparison were either bleached or untreated, then metabarcoded using multiple primer pairs. The contamination experiment resulted in the contamination of almost all spiders from pitfall traps, which was successfully eliminated with bleaching. Interestingly, there was no difference in the number of amplicon sequence variants (ASVs) detected per spider between pitfall trapping and hand sampling but bleaching resulted in significantly fewer ASV detections for both methods. Additionally, bleaching, but not sampling method, affected the taxonomic diet composition for both hand-sampled and pitfall-trapped spiders, indicating similar levels of external contamination. Our results are the first to confirm that DNA metabarcoding can be used together with bleaching for spiders sampled from pitfall traps, and that hand sampling does not necessarily exclude external DNA contamination. Thus, diet studies using metabarcoding should address the risk of external contamination with field-sampled arthropods, regardless of sampling method.},

@phdthesis{huszarik_indirect_2023,
 abstract = {Chemical pollution is a ubiquitous stressor affecting streams and their linkages to riparian forests. Contaminants act by altering the emergence of aquatic insects from streams. Emergent insects can also take up contaminants and transfer them into the terrestrial ecosystem. Emergent insects are an important source of prey for riparian insectivores and changes in the emergence flux or contamination of insects can affect the riparian food web. However, little is knownabout the implications of emerging contaminants such as agricultural pesticides and wastewatereffluent on the terrestrial food web. In this dissertation, I address possible consequences ofagricultural and wastewater stream pollution for riparian insectivores, namely bats and spiders.
The contribution of aquatic prey to riparian spider diets has mainly been determined by stableisotope analysis, but DNA metabarcoding, a highly sensitive method of identifying consumedprey using DNA, promises to further detangle changes in these trophic interactions. In Chapter2, we tested a bleaching decontamination protocol to determine the suitability of using metabarcoding on spiders contaminated during sampling. We confirmed the applicability of metabarcoding, but also found that the wolf spiders (Lyocsidae) collected in riparian areas did not appear to rely strongly on aquatic prey. This informed our choice of Tetragnatha montana, which are highly reliant on aquatic prey, for the field study in Chapter 3.
We then conducted three field studies. Chapters 3 and 4 evaluate indirect trophic effects of chemical stream pollution on spiders and bats, respectively. Chapter 5 quantifies the accumulation of pesticides from the stream to riparian spiders via emergent insects. We found that riparian bats foraged more and that spiders consumed more Chironomidae at more polluted sites, indicating that there was no overall decrease in emergence due to chemical pollution. We also found that certain pesticides accumulated in emergent insects and riparian spiders. Together, this suggests that chemical stream pollution resulted in an increased dietary exposure of riparian insectivores to contaminants, rather than a decrease in prey availability.
These results demonstrate the role of streams and aquatic-terrestrial linkages in propagating stressors across ecosystem boundaries. They also show the benefit of using sensitive methods like DNA metabarcoding to unveil trophic effects of chemical pollution. Future studies should focus on quantifying the risk of contaminant uptake and potential effects for riparian bats, as well as considering how the observed drivers change in different contamination scenarios and ecosystems. This knowledge is important to protect the functionality of the riparian ecosystem and its inhabitants.},

@article{hwang_reduction_2024,
 abstract = {A hallmark of fetal alcohol spectrum disorders (FASD) is neurobehavioral deficits that still do not have effective treatment. Here, we present that reduction of Apolipoprotein E (APOE) is critically involved in neurobehavioral deficits in FASD. We show that prenatal alcohol exposure (PAE) changes chromatin accessibility of Apoe locus, and causes reduction of APOE levels in both the brain and peripheral blood in postnatal mice. Of note, postnatal administration of an APOE receptor agonist (APOE-RA) mitigates motor learning deficits and anxiety in those mice. Several molecular and electrophysiological properties essential for learning, which are altered by PAE, are restored by APOE-RA. Our human genome-wide association study further reveals that the interaction of PAE and a single nucleotide polymorphism in the APOE enhancer which chromatin is closed by PAE in mice is associated with lower scores in the delayed matching-to-sample task in children. APOE in the plasma is also reduced in PAE children, and the reduced level is associated with their lower cognitive performance. These findings suggest that controlling the APOE level can serve as an effective treatment for neurobehavioral deficits in FASD.},

Briefly, LV vector-based Human CRISPR Activation and Knockout libraries (Calabrese and Brunello) were used to modify HEK293 and HEK293T cells. These cell populations were then expanded, and integrated LV vector genomes were rescued by transfection. LV vectors were harvested, and the process of sequential transduction and rescue-transfection was iterated. Through this workflow, guide RNAs (gRNAs) that target genes that may suppress or enhance LV vector production were enriched and identified with Next-Generation Sequencing (NGS).

This study focuses on characterizing the microbial communities associated with this unique habitat. Ancient petrified tree remnants located at depths of 18–20 m were sampled in August–September 2024, targeting four tree trunks from different sites within the bay. The quantitative assessment of selected bacterial groups, essential for nutrient cycling, organic matter degradation, and marine ecosystem health, revealed distinct community profiles. 16S rDNA sequencing of cultivated isolates identified a diverse microbial community predominantly composed of γ-Proteobacteria, with key representatives such as Vibrio aestuarianus, Vibrio orientalis, Pseudoalteromonas, and Cobetia sp. The culture-independent approach confirmed the dominance of Proteobacteria, along with other prevalent phyla like Bacteroidetes, Planctomycetes, and Actinobacteria. The most abundant taxa included Woeseia oceani, Ilumatobacter coccineus, Halioglobus maricola, and Vibrio breoganii. Archaea made up about 3\% of classified reads. Fungal sequences accounted for less than 2\% of the total reads, indicating a low fungal prevalence. These results provide essential baseline data for future monitoring and the conservation of this unique habitat and its diverse microbial communities.},

Using an in situ assay of nucleosome stability and DT40 cells expressing engineered forms of the histone variant we show that native H2A.Z, but not C-terminally truncated H2A.Z (H2A.Z∆C), is released from nucleosomes of peripheral heterochromatin at unusually high salt concentrations. H2A.Z and H3K9me3 landscapes are reorganized in H2A.Z∆C-nuclei and overall sensitivity of chromatin to nucleases is increased. These tail-dependent differences are recapitulated upon treatment of HeLa nuclei with the H2A.Z-tail-peptide (C9), with MNase sensitivity being increased genome-wide. Fluorescence correlation spectroscopy revealed C9 binding to reconstituted nucleosomes. When introduced into live cells, C9 elicited chromatin reorganization, overall nucleosome destabilization and changes in gene expression. Thus, H2A.Z-nucleosomes influence global chromatin architecture in a tail-dependent manner, what can be modulated by introducing the tail-peptide into live cells.},

We examined the bacterial communities in these domesticated soils as they are key for plant health and productivity and have a strong influence on biochemical cycles. To identify the bacteria, we used metabarcoding analysis coupled with metabolic predictions and co-occurrence networks. This analysis was performed in the bulk and rhizosphere soils during different stages in the growing season. These soil compartments had a greater effect on the bacterial communities than the plant phenological stages. The diversity and richness of the bacterial population inhabiting the rhizosphere was much lower than that in the bulk soil, comprising taxa that were significantly more represented in this soil compartment, such as bacteria from the genus Hydrogenophaga, three genera from the order Rhizobiales, and unclassified genera from the families Desulfocapsaceae and Actinobacteria. Rhizosphere co-occurrence networks revealed a high number of negative connections, indicating unstable bacterial communities that may be highly influenced by biotic and abiotic factors. Rhizosphere networks mostly rely on two taxa belonging to the phyla Proteobacteria and Cyanobacteria, which are the predicted network hubs in this soil compartment. The bulk soil conserved high bacterial diversity and richness that was stable throughout the growth period of rice. Anaerobic bacteria from genera Marmoricola, the uncultured Gemmatimonadota bacteria SDR1034 terrestrial group, Anaerolinea, and the sulphur oxidizer, Thiobacillus were highly represented. This analysis provides valuable information for understanding bacterial diversity in the rhizosphere of rice cultivated in this region, which is critical for enhancing plant growth and productivity.},

 abstract = {Citrus crops are affected by many fungal diseases. Among them, Citrus Black Spot caused by the ascomycete Phyllosticta citricarpa is particularly economically damaging wherever it occurs. Many other species of Phyllosticta are described on Citrus, but only P. citricarpa is considered a quarantine pest on the European continent. In order to prevent the introduction of this species into Europe, it is essential to have a detection test which can reliably identify it, and not confuse it with other species present on citrus, notably P. paracitricarpa. The latter taxon has recently been described as very close to P. citricarpa, and most detection tests do not allow to distinguish the two species. In this work, we exploited the genomic data of 37 isolates of Phyllosticta spp. from citrus, firstly to assess their phylogenetic relationships, and secondly to search for genomic regions that allowed the definition of species-specific markers of P. citricarpa. Analysis of 51 concatenated genes separated P. citricarpa and P. paracitricarpa in two phylogenetic clades. A locus was selected to define a hydrolysis probe and primers combination that could be used in real-time PCR for the specific detection of the quarantine species, to the exclusion of all others present on Citrus. This test was then thoroughly validated on a set of strains covering a wide geographical diversity, and on numerous biological samples to demonstrate its reliability for regulatory control. The validation data highlighted the need to check the reliability of the test in advance, when a change of reagents was being considered.},

How these defences evolve in novel host environments remains largely unknown. We studied the evolution of the CRISPR-Cas system in \textit{Mycoplasma gallisepticum} (also named \textit{Mycoplasmoides gallisepticum}), a bacterial pathogen of poultry that jumped into a passerine host {\textasciitilde}30 years ago. Over the decade following the host shift, all isolates displaying a functional CRISPR-Cas system were found not only to harbour completely new sets of spacers, but the DNA protospacer adjacent motif recognized by the main effector \textit{M. gallisepticum} Cas9 (MgCas9) was also different. These changes in CRISPR-Cas diversity and specificity are consistent with a change in the community of phages and mobile elements infecting \textit{M. gallisepticum} as it colonized the novel host. In the years following the host shift, we also detected a gradual rise in isolates displaying non-functional MgCas9. After 12 years, all circulating isolates harboured inactive forms only. This loss of CRISPR-Cas function comes at a time when the passerine host is known to have evolved widespread resistance, which in turn drove the evolution of increasing \textit{M. gallisepticum} virulence through antagonistic coevolution. Such striking concordance in the rise of inactivated forms of CRISPR-Cas and the evolution of host resistance suggests that the inactivation of the CRISPR-Cas system was necessary for enabling adaptive bacterial responses to host-driven selection. We highlight the need to consider both host and pathogen selection pressures on bacteria for understanding the evolution of CRISPR-Cas systems and the key factors driving the emergence of a pathogenic bacterium in a novel host.},

Phage therapy is a promising solution that uses naturally isolated phages to treat bacterial infections. Ecological limitations, which stipulate a discrete host range and the inevitable evolution of resistance, may be overcome through a better understanding of phage biology and the utilization of engineered phages. In this study, we developed a synthetic biology approach to construct tailed phages that naturally target clinically relevant strains of \textit{Pseudomonas aeruginosa}. As proof of concept, we successfully cloned and assembled the JG024 and DMS3 phage genomes in yeast using transformation-associated recombination cloning and rebooted these two phage genomes in two different strains of \textit{P. aeruginosa}. We identified factors that affected phage reboot efficiency like the phage species or the presence of antiviral defense systems in the bacterial strain. We have successfully extended this method to two other phage species and observed that the method enables the reboot of phages that are naturally unable to infect the strain used for reboot. This research represents a critical step toward the construction of clinically relevant, engineered \textit{P. aeruginosa} phages.IMPORTANCE\textit{Pseudomonas aeruginosa} is a bacterium responsible for severe infections and a common major complication in cystic fibrosis. The use of antibiotics to treat bacterial infections has become increasingly difficult as antibiotic resistance has become more prevalent. Phage therapy is an alternative solution that is already being used in some European countries, but its use is limited by the narrow host range due to the phage receptor specificity, the presence of antiviral defense systems in the bacterial strain, and the possible emergence of phage resistance. In this study, we demonstrate the use of a synthetic biology approach to construct and reboot clinically relevant \textit{P. aeruginosa} tailed phages. This method enables a significant expansion of possibilities through the construction of engineered phages for therapy applications.},

Despite the role of bacteriophages as drivers for microbiome structure and function, there is no information about the structure and function of the gut virome in gnotobiotic models and the link between bacterial and bacteriophage/prophage diversity. We studied the virome of gnotobiotic murine Oligo-MM12 (12 bacterial species) and reduced Altered Schaedler Flora (ASF, three bacterial species). As reference, the virome of Specific Pathogen-Free (SPF) mice was investigated. A metagenomic approach was used to assess prophages and bacteriophages in the guts of 6-week-old female mice. We identified a positive correlation between bacteria diversity, and bacteriophages and prophages. Caudoviricetes (82.4\%) were the most prominent class of phages in all samples with differing relative abundance. However, the host specificity of bacteriophages belonging to class Caudoviricetes differed depending on model bacterial diversity. We further studied the role of bacteriophages in horizontal gene transfer and microbial adaptation to the host’s environment. Analysis of mobile genetic elements showed the contribution of bacteriophages to the adaptation of bacterial amino acid metabolism. Overall, our results implicate virome “dark matter” and interactions with the host system as factors for microbial community structure and function which determine host health. Taking the importance of the virome in the microbiome diversity and horizontal gene transfer, reductions in the virome might be an important factor driving losses of microbial biodiversity and the subsequent dysbiosis of the gut microbiome.},

 abstract = {Parkinson’s disease (PD) is a progressive neurological disorder with an increasing prevalence in aging populations. Identifying effective therapeutic targets and treatments remains a critical challenge. This study aimed to discover potential therapeutic targets and design novel compounds for PD treatment. Gene expression analysis was conducted using diverse datasets, including microarray, mRNA sequencing, and miRNA sequencing. While no common genes were identified across all datasets, the RNA-seq dataset GSE-135036 was prioritized. The investigation focused on downregulated miRNAs targeting upregulated mRNAs, revealing that hsa-mir-5585 regulates Receptor-interacting serine/threonine-protein kinase 1 (RIPK1) within the Shigellosis pathway. Given RIPK1’s role in cell death and inflammation, it emerged as a promising therapeutic target for PD. To identify RIPK1 inhibitors, 67 compounds were screened via molecular docking, with CHEMBL-3109201 exhibiting the highest binding affinity. A structurally similar compound, CHEMBL-76328382, also demonstrated strong interactions. A fragment-based drug design approach generated two novel compounds, BI-1215 and BI-146, which, along with RIPK1-IN-4 and CHEMBL-70909876, were shortlisted based on docking scores and ADME profiles. Molecular dynamics simulations confirmed the stability of CHEMBL-70909876 and BI-1215, with RMSD fluctuations between 0.005 and 0.2 nm. MM-PBSA analysis further validated their superior thermodynamic stability and binding affinity compared to other candidates. This study offers novel insights into PD pathogenesis and potential therapeutic interventions, marking a significant step toward effective treatment strategies for this debilitating disorder.},

 abstract = {{\textless}h4{\textgreater}ABSTRACT{\textless}/h4{\textgreater} The current SARS-CoV-2 pandemic has rapidly become a major global health problem for which public health surveillance is crucial to monitor virus spread. Given the presence of viral RNA in feces in around 40\% of infected persons, wastewater-based epidemiology has been proposed as an addition to disease-based surveillance to assess the spread of the virus at the community level. Here we have explored the possibility of using next-generation sequencing (NGS) of sewage samples to evaluate the diversity of SARS-CoV-2 at the community level from routine wastewater testing, and compared these results with the virus diversity in patients from the Netherlands and Belgium. Phylogenetic analysis revealed the presence of viruses belonging to the most prevalent clades (19A, 20A and 20B) in both countries. Clades 19B and 20C were not identified, while they were present in clinical samples during the same period. Low frequency variant (LFV) analysis showed that some known LFVs can be associated with particular clusters within a clade, different to those of their consensus sequences, suggesting the presence of at least 2 clades within a single sewage sample. Additionally, combining genome consensus and LFV analyses we found a total of 57 unique mutations in the SARS-CoV-2 genome which have not been described before. In conclusion, this work illustrates how NGS analysis of wastewater can be used to approximate the diversity of SARS-CoV-2 viruses circulating in a community.},

 abstract = {Monitoring of SARS-CoV-2 in wastewater (WW) is a promising tool for epidemiological surveillance, correlating not only viral RNA levels with the infection dynamics within the population, but also to viral diversity. However, the complex mixture of viral lineages in WW samples makes tracking of specific variants or lineages circulating in the population a challenging task. We sequenced sewage samples of 9 WW-catchment areas within the city of Rotterdam, used specific signature mutations from individual SARS-CoV-2 lineages to estimate their relative abundances in WW and compared them against those observed in clinical genomic surveillance of infected individuals between September 2020 and December 2021. We showed that especially for dominant lineages, the median of the frequencies of signature mutations coincides with the occurrence of those lineages in Rotterdam's clinical genomic surveillance. This, along with digital droplet RT-PCR targeting signature mutations of specific variants of concern (VOCs), showed that several VOCs emerged, became dominant and were replaced by the next VOC in Rotterdam at different time points during the study. In addition, single nucleotide variant (SNV) analysis provided evidence that spatio-temporal clusters can also be discerned from WW samples. We were able to detect specific SNVs in sewage, including one resulting in the Q183H amino acid change in the Spike gene, that was not captured by clinical genomic surveillance. Our results highlight the potential use of WW samples for genomic surveillance, increasing the set of epidemiological tools to monitor SARS-CoV-2 diversity.},

 abstract = {Background The histone methyltransferase DOT1L catalyzes methylation of H3K79 and it is highly conserved in mammals. DOT1L plays a functional role in several biological processes including cell cycle regulation, DNA repair, RNA splicing and gene expression, suggesting a complex role in chromatin organization and regulation. Such a remarkable range of functions performed by DOT1L can be the result, at least partially, of its interaction with a plethora of proteins and presence in different complexes.
Results Here, we characterized the cooperation of DOT1L with the nucleolar protein NPM1 and the impact of both proteins on peri-nucleolar heterochromatin activity. We show that i) DOT1L interacts preferentially with monomeric NPM1 in the nucleus; ii) DOT1L acts in concert with NPM1 to maintain each other’s protein homeostasis; iii) NPM1 depletion results in H3K79me2 upregulation at chromatin remodeling genes but does not affect their expression; iv) DOT1L and NPM1 preserved DNA satellite expression at perinucleolar heterochromatin via epigenetic mechanisms dependent on H3K27me3.
Conclusions Our findings give insights into molecular mechanisms employed by DOT1L and NPM1 to regulate heterochromatin activities around the nucleoli and shed light on one aspect of the complex role of both proteins in chromatin dynamics.},

 abstract = {Sortases are critical cysteine transpeptidases that facilitate the attachment of proteins to the cell wall in Gram-positive bacteria. These enzymes are potential targets for novel antibiotic development, and versatile tools in protein engineering applications. There are six classes of sortases recognized, yet class A sortases (SrtA) are the most widely studied and utilized. SrtA enzymes endogenously recognize the amino acid sequence LPXTG, where X = any amino acid, with additional promiscuity now recognized in multiple positions for certain SrtA enzymes. Much less is known about Class B sortases (SrtB), which target a distinct sequence, typically with an N-terminal Asn, e.g., variations of NPXTG or NPQTN. Although understudied overall, two SrtB enzymes were previously shown to be specific for heme transporter proteins, and in vitro experiments with the catalytic domains of these enzymes reveal activities significantly worse than SrtA from the same organisms. Here, we use protein biochemistry, structural analyses, and computational simulations to better understand and characterize these enzymes, specifically investigating Bacillus anthracis SrtB (baSrtB) as a model SrtB protein. Structural modeling predicts a plausible enzyme-substrate complex, which is verified by mutagenesis of binding cleft residues. Furthermore, residues N- and C-terminal to the pentapeptide recognition motif are critical for observed activity. Finally, we use chimeric proteins to identify mutations that improve baSrtB activity by ∼4-fold, and demonstrate the feasibility of sortase-mediated ligation using a baSrtB enzyme variant. These studies provide insight into SrtB-target binding as well as evidence that SrtB enzymes can be modified to be of potential use in protein engineering.},

By examining and elucidating microbial genomes in healthy and infected samples, the metagenomics branch has allowed us to discover the significance of microbial genomes. The metagenomic approach used in the covid-19 infectious disease will serve as a prominent tool for explicating the relationship between host-associated microbial communities and host phenotype.

For metagenomics analyses, Galaxy server was used identification and classification of microbial communities furhter taxonomic analysis and functional analysis was also performed. Different tools from the galaxy like FastQC, MultiQC, Trim Galore, Megahit, Kraken 2, Convert Kraken, Krona Pie Chart and HUMANn2 were used for complete metagenomic analysis. Metagenomic Analysis shows that there is difference in the percentage and abundance of bacteria in all the covid-19 patients sample. The fungi that were commonly present in all the samples were identified as Eurotiales 78-93\% and Mycospaerellales 7-20\% and the other fungi that were not common but were observed are Dipodasceae 10\% and Sordariales 4-6\%.

Here, we report the adaptation of SARS-CoV-2 to the mAb cocktail REGN-COV in a kidney transplant patient with hypogammaglobulinemia. Following mAb treatment, the patient did not clear the infection. During viral persistence, SARS-CoV-2 acquired three novel spike mutations. Neutralization and mouse protection analyses demonstrate a complete viral escape from REGN-COV at the expense of ACE-2 binding. Final clearance of the virus occurred upon reduction of the immunosuppressive regimen and total IgG substitution. Serology suggests that the development of highly neutralizing IgM rather than IgG substitution aids clearance. Our findings emphasise that selection pressure by mAbs on SARS-CoV-2 can lead to development of escape variants in immunocompromised patients. Thus, modification of immunosuppressive therapy, if possible, might be preferable to control and clearance of the viral infection.},

 abstract = {Bloodstream infections caused by \textit{Pseudomonas aeruginosa} are associated with high mortality rates. The complement system, a key component of the innate immune response, plays a major role in eliminating \textit{P. aeruginosa} from human blood. However, the sensitivity of \textit{P. aeruginosa} strains to plasma varies widely, ranging from highly sensitive to persistent or fully resistant. Although most studies use model strains, the species genomic and phenotypic diversities suggest more complex interactions with complement than previously appreciated. In this study, we characterized the plasma resistome of \textit{P. aeruginosa} using Tn-seq in three strains with varying levels of plasma sensitivity. A gain-of-function screen in the plasma-sensitive strain PA14 revealed numerous bacterial factors influencing plasma resistance, including components of the RetS-LadS/Gac/Rsm regulatory pathway and outer membrane porins. In the plasma-resistant strains CHA and YIK, Tn-seq analysis indicated that each strain relies on a distinct, limited set of proteins to evade complement-mediated killing. Despite these differences, we identified common mechanisms across all three strains. These include the production of exopolysaccharides (EPSs), the presence of surface appendages, and modifications in the O-specific antigen. Notably, we identified Ssg and Crc as shared contributors to plasma resistance. Although deletion mutants lacking \textit{ssg} and/or \textit{crc} exhibited reduced survival in plasma, a subpopulation of these mutants was able to persist during prolonged exposure. Overall, this work provides new insights into the complex interplay between \textit{P. aeruginosa} and the human complement system in the context of bloodstream infections and raises concerns regarding the efficacy of therapies that target individual virulence factors.},

 abstract = {The current human reference genome, GRCh38, represents over 20 years of effort to generate a high-quality assembly, which has benefitted society1,2. However, it still has many gaps and errors, and does not represent a biological genome as it is a blend of multiple individuals3,4. Recently, a high-quality telomere-to-telomere reference, CHM13, was generated with the latest long-read technologies, but it was derived from a hydatidiform mole cell line with a nearly homozygous genome5. To address these limitations, the Human Pangenome Reference Consortium formed with the goal of creating high-quality, cost-effective, diploid genome assemblies for a pangenome reference that represents human genetic diversity6. Here, in our first scientific report, we determined which combination of current genome sequencing and assembly approaches yield the most complete and accurate diploid genome assembly with minimal manual curation. Approaches that used highly accurate long reads and parent–child data with graph-based haplotype phasing during assembly outperformed those that did not. Developing a combination of the top-performing methods, we generated our first high-quality diploid reference assembly, containing only approximately four gaps per chromosome on average, with most chromosomes within ±1\% of the length of CHM13. Nearly 48\% of protein-coding genes have non-synonymous amino acid changes between haplotypes, and centromeric regions showed the highest diversity. Our findings serve as a foundation for assembling near-complete diploid human genomes at scale for a pangenome reference to capture global genetic variation from single nucleotides to structural rearrangements.},

 abstract = {The plant pathogen Magnaporthe oryzae poses a significant threat to global food security, and its management through the cultivation of resistant varieties and crop husbandry practices, including fungicidal sprays, has proven to be inadequate. To address this issue, we conducted small-RNA sequencing to identify the roles of miRNAs and their target genes in both resistant (PB1637) and susceptible (PB1) rice genotypes. We confirmed the expression of differentially expressed miRNAs using stem-loop qRT-PCR analysis and correlated them with rice patho-phenotypic and physio-biochemical responses. Our findings revealed several noteworthy differences between the resistant and susceptible genotypes. The resistant genotype exhibited reduced levels of total chlorophyll and carotenoids compared to the susceptible genotype. However, it showed increased levels of total protein, callose, H2O2, antioxidants, flavonoids, and total polyphenols. Additionally, among the defense-associated enzymes, guaiacol peroxidase and polyphenol oxidase responses were higher in the susceptible genotypes. In our comparative analysis, we identified 27 up-regulated and 43 down-regulated miRNAs in the resistant genotype, while the susceptible genotype exhibited 44 up-regulated and 62 down-regulated miRNAs. Furthermore, we discovered eight up-regulated and five down-regulated miRNAs shared between the resistant and susceptible genotypes. Notably, we also identified six novel miRNAs in the resistant genotype and eight novel miRNAs in the susceptible genotype. These novel miRNAs, namely Chr8\_26996, Chr12\_40110, and Chr12\_41899, were found to negatively correlate with the expression of predicted target genes, including Cyt-P450 monooxygenase, serine carboxypeptidase, and zinc finger A20 domain-containing stress-associated protein, respectively. The results of our study on miRNA and transcriptional responses provide valuable insights for the development of future rice lines that are resistant to blast disease. By understanding the roles of specific miRNAs and their target genes in conferring resistance, we can enhance breeding strategies and improve crop management practices to ensure global food security.},

@article{jdeed_redistribution_2022,
 abstract = {Therapeutic targets in cancer cells defective for the tumor suppressor ARID1A are fundamentals of synthetic lethal strategies. However, whether modulating ARID1A function in premalignant breast epithelial cells could be exploited to reduce carcinogenic potential remains to be elucidated. In search of chromatin-modulating mechanisms activated by anti-proliferative agents in normal breast epithelial (HME-hTert) cells, we identified a distinct pattern of genome-wide H3K27 histone acetylation marks characteristic for the combined treatment by the cancer preventive rexinoid bexarotene (Bex) and carvedilol (Carv). Among these marks, several enhancers functionally linked to TGF-β signaling were enriched for ARID1A and Brg1, subunits within the SWI/SNF chromatin-remodeling complex. The recruitment of ARID1A and Brg1 was associated with the suppression of TGFBR2, KLF4, and FoxQ1, and the induction of BMP6, while the inverse pattern ensued upon the knock-down of ARID1A. Bex+Carv treatment resulted in fewer cells expressing N-cadherin and dictated a more epithelial phenotype. However, the silencing of ARID1A expression reversed the ability of Bex and Carv to limit epithelial–mesenchymal transition. The nuclear levels of SMAD4, a canonical mediator of TGF-β action, were more effectively suppressed by the combination than by TGF-β. In contrast, TGF-β treatment exceeded the ability of Bex+Carv to lower nuclear FoxQ1 levels and induced markedly higher E-cadherin positivity, indicating a target-selective antagonism of Bex+Carv to TGF-β action. In summary, the chromatin-wide redistribution of ARID1A by Bex and Carv treatment is instrumental in the suppression of genes mediating TGF-β signaling, and, thus, the morphologic reprogramming of normal breast epithelial cells. The concerted engagement of functionally linked targets using low toxicity clinical agents represents an attractive new approach for cancer interception.},

 abstract = {Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infections have been frequently reported in companion dogs and cats worldwide during the ongoing coronavirus disease. However, RT-qPCR methods developed for humans have been used for the diagnosis of SARS-CoV-2 infections in suspected companion dogs and cats owing to the lack of the companion animal-tailored methods. Therefore, we developed a multiplex RT-qPCR (mRT-qPCR) using newly designed primers and probes targeting RdRp and N genes of all currently circulating SARS-CoV-2 variants as well as the canine or feline 16S rRNA gene as an endogenous internal positive control (EIPC) for reliable diagnosis of SARS-CoV-2 infection from suspected dogs and cats. The developed mRT-qPCR assay specifically detected the target genes of SARS-CoV-2 but no other canine or feline pathogens. Furthermore, canine and feline EIPCs were stably amplified by mRT-qPCR in samples containing canine- or feline-origin cellular materials. This assay has high repeatability and reproducibility, with an optimal limit of detection ({\textless}10 RNA copies per reaction) and coefficients of variation ({\textless}1.0\%). The detection rate of SARS-CoV-2 of the developed mRT-qPCR was 6.6\% for canine and feline nasopharyngeal samples, which was consistent with that of a commercial mRT-qPCR kit for humans. Collectively, the newly developed mRT-qPCR with canine and feline EIPC can efficiently diagnose and evaluate the viral load in field specimens and will be a valuable tool for etiological diagnosis, epidemiological study, and controlling SARS-CoV-2 infections in canine and feline populations.},

 abstract = {The chromosomal translocation t(12;21)(p13;q22) gives rise to ETV6::RUNX1, the most common oncogenic fusion gene in pediatric B cell precursor acute lymphoblastic leukemia (BCP-ALL). ETV6::RUNX1 arises before birth at high frequency and induces a clinically silent state that can persist for over a decade. In \&lt;1\% of carriers, these preleukemic cells acquire secondary mutations that induce transformation to overt leukemia. The mechanisms contributing to quiescence of ETV6::RUNX1+ preleukemic cells still remain elusive. In this thesis, factors involved in ETV6::RUNX1+ preleukemia are characterized by generating CRISPR/Cas9-edited human induced pluripotent stem cell (hiPSC) models. These preleukemic hiPSC models express ETV6::RUNX1 at physiological levels via the endogenous ETV6 promoter. Transcriptional analyses identified upregulation of linker histone H1-0 at the ETV6::RUNX1+ preleukemic state, both in hiPSCs and during early B lymphoid differentiation. Moreover, publicly available expression data of 3,026 leukemia patient samples showed significantly elevated H1-0 levels in ETV6::RUNX1+ BCP-ALL compared to other leukemia entities. Dual-luciferase promoter assays revealed that H1-0 promoter activity can be induced by ETV6::RUNX1, but not by RUNX1. While chromatin immunoprecipitation assays did not indicate direct binding of ETV6::RUNX1 to the H1-0 promoter, H1-0 expression might be indirectly regulated via DNA methylation of a CpG island shore element or histone acetylation. Depletion of H1-0 via RNA interference affected epigenetic processes and inhibited ETV6::RUNX1 signature genes, including RAG1 and EPOR, indicating a key role of H1-0 in regulating the ETV6::RUNX1 transcriptome. Analysis of single-cell sequencing data showed that H1-0 is highly expressed in quiescent hematopoietic cells. H1-0 expression can be induced in BCP-ALL cell lines by addition of histone deacetylase inhibitors (HDACis) and H1-0 protein levels correspond to susceptibility towards this drug class. Following up on these findings, combinatorial drug treatments using the H1-0-inducing HDACi Quisinostat were performed. These experiments showed promising synergism of Quisinostat with established chemotherapeutic drugs used for B-ALL treatment and the proteasome inhibitor Bortezomib in ETV6::RUNX1+ cells. Taken together, these data identify H1-0 as a key regulator of the ETV6::RUNX1+ transcriptome and indicate that induction of H1-0 via HDACis might be a potential novel approach to improve ETV6::RUNX1+ BCP-ALL treatment.},

 abstract = {Dipylidium caninum (Linnaeus, 1758) is a common zoonotic cestode of dogs and cats worldwide. Previous studies have demonstrated the existence of largely host-associated canine and feline genotypes based on infection studies, differences at the 28S rDNA gene, and complete mitochondrial genomes. There have been no comparative genome-wide studies. Here, we sequenced the genomes of a dog and cat isolate of Dipylidium caninum from the United States using the Illumina platform at mean coverage depths of 45× and 26× and conducted comparative analyses with the reference draft genome. Complete mitochondrial genomes were used to confirm the genotypes of the isolates. Genomes of D. caninum canine and feline genotypes generated in this study, had an average identity of 98\% and 89\%, respectively, when compared to the reference genome. SNPs were 20 times higher in the feline isolate. Comparison and species delimitation using universally conserved orthologs and protein-coding mitochondrial genes revealed that the canine and feline isolates are different species. Data from this study build a base for future integrative taxonomy. Further genomic studies from geographically diverse populations are necessary to understand implications for taxonomy, epidemiology, veterinary clinical medicine, and anthelmintic resistance.},

 abstract = {Diabetes mellitus is a metabolic disorder that persists as a global threat to the world. A G-protein coupled receptor (GPCR), free fatty acid receptor 4 (FFAR4), has emerged as a potential target for type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) and obesity-related disorders. The current study has investigated the FFAR4, deploying 3-dimensional structure modeling, molecular docking, machine learning, and high-throughput virtual screening methods to unravel the receptor’s crucial and non-crucial binding site residues. We screened four lakh compounds and shortlisted them based on binding energy, stereochemical considerations, non-bonded interactions, and pharmacokinetic profiling. Out of the screened compounds, four compounds were selected for ligand-bound simulations. The molecular dynamic simulations were carried out for 1µs for native FFAR4 and 500 ns each for complexes of FFAR4 with compound 1, compound 2, compound 3, and compound 4. Our findings showed that in addition to reported binding site residues ARG99, ARG183, and VAL98 in known agonists like TUG-891, the amino acids ARG22, ARG24, THR23, TRP305, and GLU43 were also critical binding site residues. These amino acids impart stability to the FFAR4 complexes and contribute to the stronger binding affinity of the compounds. The study also indicated that aromatic residues like PHE211 are crucial for recognizing the active site’s pi-pi and C-C double bonds. Since FFAR4 is a membrane protein, the simulation studies give an insight into the mechanisms of the crucial protein-lipid and lipid-water interactions. The analysis of the molecular dynamics trajectories showed all four compounds as potential hit molecules that can be developed further into potential agonists for T2DM therapy. Amongst the four compounds, compound 4 showed relatively better binding affinity, stronger non-bonded interactions, and a stable complex. Communicated by Ramaswamy H. Sarma},

 abstract = {As one of the four primary evolutionary groups within myriapods, centipedes (Chilopoda) comprise approximately 3150 valid species. Recent molecular studies have begun to elucidate the phylogeny and time to divergence in Chilopoda; yet, identifying scutigeromorphs at the species level remains a notoriously challenging task. In this study, we obtained seven new complete mitogenomes of Thereuopoda clunifera (Wood, 1862) to investigate the phylogeny and divergence times of Chilopoda. Both maximum likelihood (ML) and Bayesian inference (BI) analyses recovered the relationship of (Scutigeromorpha + (Scolopendromorpha + (Lithobiomorpha + Geophilomorpha))). For Scutigeromorpha, seven newly sequenced mitogenomes of T. clunifera were divided into four distinct clades. Divergence time estimates suggest that the basal split of Chilopoda occurred during the Middle Ordovician period, with the origins of Scolopendromorpha, Lithobiomorpha, and Geophilomorpha dating to the Devonian period. Factors such as warm climates, coevolution between predator and prey, and the rifting of the Hainan Island may have driven the diversification of Scutigeromorpha. Based on genetic distance, the delimitation of molecular species, phylogenetic relationships, and divergence time analyses, we identified three cryptic species that existed within T. clunifera. This exceptionally high degree of hidden diversity can be ascribed to the morphological stasis that has occurred since the Paleozoic era and taxonomic impediment.},

Currently, whole genome sequencing technology has been widely used to study the phylogenetic relationships of Salmonella, primarily using the Illumina short-read platform. Complete genome sequence data of Salmonella are rarely systematically analyzed in similar studies considering the relatively high cost currently. Therefore, here we collected the complete genome sequence data of 1819 Salmonella in GenBank and classified these strains into different subspecies, serovars, and STs by SISTR, Seqsero2, multilocus sequence typing (MLST), and other sophisticated software. In addition, we constructed and demonstrated different phylogenetic trees by four methods with high discriminatory power: core single-nucleotide polymorphism typing, core genome MLST (cgMLST), clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeat typing, and pan-genome typing. The different typing methods are systematically presented, along with a comparison of the characteristics of the four distinct typing methods used in this chapter. In conclusion, we have made a new attempt to use complete genome sequence datasets to study the phylogenetic relationships of Salmonella. Additional considerations regarding the time required to be consumed, the clustering effect, and the cgMLST method are also discussed.},

 abstract = {Most hospital-acquired urinary tract infections are the result of implanted urinary catheter, with majority of studies focused on a single species colonisation, but recently polymicrobial colonisations are being reported. In this study, indwelling urinary catheters were collected from ICU patients and the colonising microbiome was isolated and identified by the traditional; culturing method and metagenomics. It was observed that majority of catheters were colonised by polymicrobial biofilms, containing both bacterial and fungal isolates making them diverse and complex. However, the metagenomics results were quite surprising showing the presence of multiple organisms of which only 1or 2 showed growth when cultured. Later, in vitro assays were performed by selecting 6 combinations, with each combination containing one Candida spp. – C. albicans or C. tropicalis with one bacteria K. pneumoniae, P. aeruginosa or E. coli. It was observed that polymicrobial biofilms were stronger than mono-microbial biofilms, suggesting their increased surface adhesion. Furthermore, to simulate the dynamic environment in which cells are exposed to a certain level of fluid movement, a flow system was established to imitate the flow generated in colonized urinary catheter. We have observed changes in biofilm architecture, adhesion and thickness under flow conditions compared with static conditions, with a uniformly adhered biofilm with increased thickness of polymicrobial biofilms as compared to mono-species biofilms. The biofilm formed under flow was more viable than the static biofilm with higher number of live cells in flow condition.},

Among DYRK class II members, dual specificity tyrosine phosphorylation-regulated kinase 2 (DYRK2) is the functional target for prostate cancer treatment. Studies show that subfamilies of DYRKs are also capable to phosphorylate (tyrosine, serine, and threonine) residues, yet little research has been carried out for its inhibitors. In this article, conceptual density theory is used to estimate the physicochemical properties of 30 experimentally synthesized inhibitors targeting DYRK2. The HOMO–LUMO gap showed low reactivity and high chemical activity for the inhibitors. The biological efficacy of these 30 inhibitors is predicted by bioavailability, mutagenicity, and cardiotoxicity measures. The inhibitors showed low toxicity and no blood brain barrier permeability. Results indicated that the physiological actions of these inhibitors involve multiple target interactions. Since the experimental results of the DYRK2 protein showed great water solubility, favorable safety properties, and potential anti-prostate cancer activities for ligand 24, docking and molecular dynamics simulations from the Galaxy webserver using Gromacs open-source tools are also performed for (DYRK2-24) complex (PDB: 7EJV).

 abstract = {The neural melanocortin receptors, specifically MC3R and MC4R, play a crucial role in regulating energy homeostasis in rats. This study focuses on the theoretical evaluation of 16 orally bioavailable, small-molecule MC4R antagonists identified through experimental hit identification processes. Conceptual Density Functional Theory (CDFT) is applied to study the reactivity and stability of 16 antagonists. The physicochemical properties and metabolic activities are studied using various bioinformatics tools. Ramachandran plot analysis of MC4R protein is carried out for experimental MC4R protein structure. The active sites for MC4R protein is predicted with Active site prediction tool. MD simulations for (MC4R-antagonists) are carried out with HDOCK server. The (MC4R-16) complex showed strong binding interactions which validated the experimental results. MD simulations for Alphafold3 docked (MC4R-16) complex is carried out using Galaxy based GroMacs tools for 30 ns due to potential shortcomings of the single-trajectory approach. Further various tools are used to evaluate the physicochemical properties, metabolic properties and toxicity assessment of the studied 16 complexes. SwissTargetPrediction webserver is used to predict the multitarget activities of the antagonists. High ionization potentials (IP), low electron affinities (EA), and larger HOMO–LUMO (HL) gaps suggest the stability and reactivity of complexes. All 16 MC4R antagonists are found to be non-toxic (MUT, TUM), with its potential safety for arrhythmia and hypertension. High gastrointestinal (GI) absorption and blood–brain barrier (BBB) permeability is observed for the antagonists. (MC4R-16) complex demonstrated system adaptability and increased conformational flexibility in loop regions, with strong hydrophobic interactions, validating the experimental findings which showed that complex 16 is effective in an aged rat model of anorexia-cachexia syndrome and has progressed to clinical trials.},

The potential of plant-based diets in the form of functional foods is increasingly being realized as an option to treat and/or prevent several diseases. In this work, we have selected flaxseed (Linum usitatissimum), also known as linseed to study its pharmacological efficacy and proposed mechanisms of action for medicinal purposes. The target genes of linseed with disease specificity index (DSI {\textgreater} 0.6) are compared to the associated genes of diabetes mellitus, decrease in appetite, addictive behavior, cardiovascular diseases, Inflammatory Bowel Diseases (IMD), Polycystic Ovary Syndrome (PCOS) and the selected genes are evaluation further using in silico methods. The binding affinity of flaxseed to three common target proteins family (CCDC28b, PDCD6IP and USP34) is assessed by docking and Molecular dynamics (MD) simulations. Results show that linseed is safe to use for mutagenic toxicity and other cardiotoxicity measures but linseed is unsafe for embryotoxicity, herG toxicity and cardiac failure. The protein-protein interaction (PPI) network, Gene Ontology (GO) and Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) pathways analysis indicates that flaxseed can be used as a medicinal herb for diabetes mellitus, cardiovascular diseases, Inflammatory Bowel Diseases (IMD) and Polycystic Ovary Syndrome (PCOS).},

The biological mechanisms underlying their wide range of adaptations to diverse ecological niches remain elusive. In order to unravel the molecular basis of their adaptability, we generated a comprehensive RNAseq dataset comprising 11 isopod species belonging to the three different suborders: freshwater Asellota, marine, brackish and freshwater Sphaeromatidea, and terrestrial Oniscidea, with representatives from families Asellidae, Sphaeromatidae, and Trichoniscidae, respectively. Representatives of each family were collected from both cave and surface environments, representing at least three independent cave colonization events. Three biological replicates were sequenced from each species to ensure data robustness. The 11 high-quality RNAseq datasets will serve as a valuable resource for understanding cave-specific adaptations, comparative and functional genomics, ecological annotation as well as aid in conservation efforts of these non-model organisms. Importantly, transcriptomes of eight featured species have been made publicly accessible for the first time.},

@article{junge_atp-gated_2024,
 abstract = {Key Points 

Parenchymal T cells in the kidney expressed much higher levels of P2X7 than vascular T cells.
P2X7-blocking nanobodies uncover a large fraction of kidney-resident natural killer T and tissue-resident memory T cells.
These cells were lost during cell preparation because of activation of P2X7 by NAD+ released from damaged cells, unless blocked by nanobodies.


Background 
The P2X7 ion channel, a key sensor of sterile inflammation, has been implicated as a therapeutic target in GN, and P2X7-antagonistic nanobodies can attenuate experimental GN. However, little is known about the expression of P2X7 on renal immune cells.
Methods 
We used conventional immunofluorescence of kidney sections and intraperitoneal injection of nanobodies in mice followed by flow cytometry analysis of parenchymal T cells and RNA sequencing to elucidate the expression and function of P2X7 on parenchymal and vascular immune cells in the mouse kidney.
Results 
Our study showed that parenchymal T cells, including a large subset of natural killer T cells and CD69+ tissue-resident memory T cells, display much higher cell surface levels of P2X7 than vascular T cells. After a single intraperitoneal injection of P2X7-blocking nanobodies, P2X7 on parenchymal T cells was fully occupied by the injected nanobodies within 30 minutes. This resulted in an effective protection of these cells from nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide–induced cell death during cell preparation. Conversely, systemic injection of nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide that mimics sterile inflammation results in the selective depletion of P2X7hiCD69hi T cells from the kidney parenchyma.
Conclusions 
Our study uncovered a novel purinergic regulatory mechanism affecting kidney-resident T-cell populations.

 abstract = {Extrinsic postzygotic isolation, where hybrids experience reductions in fitness due to a mismatch with their environment, is central to speciation. Knowledge of genetic variants that underlie extrinsic isolation is crucial for understanding the early stages of speciation. Differences in seasonal migration are strong candidates for extrinsic isolation (e.g., if hybrids take intermediate and inferior routes compared to pure forms). Here, we used a hybrid zone between two subspecies of the songbird Swainson’s thrush (Catharus ustulatus) with different migratory routes and tests for viability selection (locus-specific changes in interspecific heterozygosity and ancestry mismatch across age classes) to gain insight into the genetic basis of extrinsic isolation. Using data from over 900 individuals we find strong evidence for viability selection on both interspecific heterozygosity and ancestry mismatch at loci linked to migration. Much of this selection was dependent on genome-wide ancestry; as expected, a subset of hybrids exhibited reduced viability, but remarkably, another subset appears to fill an unoccupied fitness peak within the species, exhibiting higher viability than even parental forms. Many of the variants that influence hybrid viability appear to occur in structural variants, including a putative pericentric inversion. Our study emphasizes the importance of epistatic interactions and structural variants in speciation.},

We identified the genes that confer plant growth promoting (PGP) function, which include those involved in siderophore production, indole-3-acetic acid biosynthesis, phosphate solubilization, nitrogen metabolism, and potassium metabolism. We also identified several other genes, such as chitinase, peroxidase, superoxide dismutase, catalase, proline biosynthesis, and glucose dehydrogenase, which are believed to be involved in the control of wilt disease. These genes revealed that the strain UP1A-1 has physiologically adapted to varied environmental conditions and could potentially control both abiotic and biotic stresses.},

Although the strain showed resistance to ampicillin in vitro among the antibiotics tested, it showed sensitivity to ampicillin in vivo in Bombyx larvae. Direct injection of aqueous extracts of hog plum or Indian gooseberry into the midgut of larvae infected with K. aerogenes increased larval survival rate to {\textasciitilde} 75\% after 72 h.

It causes acute and chronic infections and is notorious for its multidrug resistance and tolerance. To systematically uncover genetic vulnerabilities that could be exploited as therapeutic targets, we present a portable high-density CRISPR interference (CRISPRi) library comprising {\textgreater}80’000 single-guide RNAs (sgRNAs) targeting virtually all annotated coding sequences and intergenic regions of P. aeruginosa PAO1. This library was used to assess the genome-wide fitness landscapes under different growth conditions, uncovering gain- and loss- of-function phenotypes for more than a thousand genes upon depletion. Many of the phenotypes are likely caused by hypomorphic (partial loss-of-function) alleles that would not be easily accessible by traditional transposon sequencing (Tn-Seq). Focusing on central carbon metabolism, we reveal two glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenases as central, non-redundant nodes in glycolytic and gluconeogenic growth conditions that might be promising targets to redirect carbon flux away from metabolically persistent states associated with chronic infections. More generally, our comprehensive sgRNA libraries are a valuable resource to access genome-wide quantitative phenotypes through CRISPRi beyond the binary phenotypes offered by Tn-Seq.},

 abstract = {The switch/sucrose non-fermenting (SWI/SNF) complex is an ATP-dependent chromatin remodeller that regulates the spacing of nucleosomes and thereby controls gene expression. Heterozygous mutations in genes encoding subunits of the SWI/SNF complex have been reported in individuals with Coffin-Siris syndrome (CSS), with the majority of the mutations in \textit{ARID1B}. CSS is a rare congenital disorder characterized by facial dysmorphisms, digital anomalies, and variable intellectual disability. We hypothesized that mutations in genes encoding subunits of the ubiquitously expressed SWI/SNF complex may lead to alterations of the nucleosome profiles in different cell types. We performed the first study on CSS-patient samples and investigated the nucleosome landscapes of cell-free DNA (cfDNA) isolated from blood plasma by whole-genome sequencing. In addition, we studied the nucleosome landscapes of CD14$^{\textrm{+}}$ monocytes from CSS-affected individuals by nucleosome occupancy and methylome-sequencing (NOMe-seq) as well as their expression profiles. In cfDNA of CSS-affected individuals with heterozygous \textit{ARID1B} mutations, we did not observe major changes in the nucleosome profile around transcription start sites. In CD14$^{\textrm{+}}$ monocytes, we found few genomic regions with different nucleosome occupancy when compared to controls. RNA-seq analysis of CD14$^{\textrm{+}}$ monocytes of these individuals detected only few differentially expressed genes, which were not in proximity to any of the identified differential nucleosome-depleted regions. In conclusion, we show that heterozygous mutations in the human SWI/SNF subunit ARID1B do not have a major impact on the nucleosome landscape or gene expression in blood cells. This might be due to functional redundancy, cell-type specificity, or alternative functions of ARID1B.},

 abstract = {Sorting receptor SORCS2 is a stress-response factor protecting neurons from acute insults, such as during epilepsy. SORCS2 is also expressed in the pancreas, yet its action in this tissue remains unknown. Combining metabolic studies in SORCS2-deficient mice with ex vivo functional analyses and single-cell transcriptomics of pancreatic tissues, we identified a role for SORCS2 in protective stress response in pancreatic islets, essential to sustain insulin release. We show that SORCS2 is predominantly expressed in islet alpha cells. Loss of expression coincides with inability of these cells to produce osteopontin, a secreted factor that facilitates insulin release from stressed beta cells. In line with diminished osteopontin levels, beta cells in SORCS2-deficient islets show gene expression patterns indicative of aggravated cell stress, and exhibit defects in insulin granule maturation and a blunted glucose response. These findings corroborate a function for SORCS2 in protective stress response that extends to metabolism.},

@article{kamajian_identification_2024,
 abstract = {Spot blotch disease, caused by the fungal pathogen Bipolaris sorokiniana, poses a significant threat to global production particularly wheat, and barley due to substantial yield losses. Similar to many fungal pathogens, the infection of host plants heavily depends on the pathogen's ability to secrete effector proteins, which manipulate host defenses and aid disease progression. However, a critical knowledge gap exists in the comprehensive identification and characterization of effector candidates (ECs) in B. sorokiniana, requiring further research efforts. Therefore, study aimed to systematically identify and characterize ECs in B. sorokiniana by conducting pathogenicity tests to confirm disease symptoms on wheat leaves, utilizing a rigorous bioinformatics approach to predict ECs through sequence analysis and structural similarities, and validating effector expression profiles during infection using RNA sequencing (RNA-Seq) and quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR). Pathogenicity testing confirmed the typical symptoms of spot blotch disease upon inoculation with B. sorokiniana. Through bioinformatics analysis, 81 ECs were identified, showing dynamic expression patterns during infection stages. Among these ECs, genes such as Cocsa1{\textbar}129517, Cocsa1{\textbar}141231, and Cocsa1{\textbar}193443 stood out due to their different expression patterns and structural similarities, indicating their potential roles as effectors. This study offers new novel insights into the effector repertoire of B. sorokiniana and its implications for spot blotch disease management. The identified ECs present promising targets for further investigation to clarify their specific roles in fungal virulence and host immune modulation.},

@article{kandinov_azithromycin_2023,
 abstract = {The aim of this work was to study the resistance to macrolides (azithromycin) in the modern Russian population of N. gonorrhoeae with the analysis of genetic resistance determinants. Azithromycin is not used to treat gonococcal infection in Russia. However, among 162 isolates collected in 2020–2021, 22 isolates (13.6\%) were phenotypically resistant to azithromycin. Mutations in 23S rRNA genes were found only in two isolates; erm and mefA genes were absent. Azithromycin resistance was shown to be predominantly associated with mutations in the mtrR and mtrD genes of the MtrCDE efflux pump and their mosaic alleles which may have formed due to a horizontal transfer from N. meningitidis. A total of 30 types of mtrR alleles and 10 types of mtrD alleles were identified including mosaic variants. Matching between the mtrR and mtrD alleles was revealed to indicate the cooperative molecular evolution of these genes. A link between the mtrR and mtrD alleles and NG-MAST types was found only for NG-MAST 228 and 807, typical of N. gonorrhoeae in Russia. The high level of resistance to azithromycin in Russia may be related to the spread of multiple transferable resistance to antimicrobials regardless of their use in the treatment of gonococcal infection.},

 abstract = {The goal of this work was to determine the factors affecting the emergence of azithromycin-resistant Neisseria gonorrhoeae isolates in Russia, where azithromycin was never recommended for the treatment of gonococcal infections. Clinical N. gonorrhoeae isolates collected in 2018–2021 (428 isolates) were analyzed. No azithromycin-resistant isolates were found in 2018–2019, but in 2020–2021, a significant increase in the ratio of azithromycin-resistant isolates was observed: 16.8\% and 9.3\%, respectively. A hydrogel DNA microarray was developed for the analysis of resistance determinants: mutations in the genes encoding the mtrCDE efflux system and in all four copies of the 23S rRNA gene (position 2611). A majority of the azithromycin-resistant Russian isolates belonged to the NG-MAST G12302 genogroup, and the resistance was associated with the presence of a mosaic structure of the mtrR gene promoter region with the −35 delA deletion, an Ala86Thr mutation in the mtrR gene, and a mosaic structure of the mtrD gene. A comparative phylogenetic study of modern Russian and European N. gonorrhoeae populations allowed us to conclude that the emergence of azithromycin resistance in Russia in 2020 was the result of the appearance and spread of European N. gonorrhoeae strains belonging to the G12302 genogroup due to possible cross-border transfer.},

 abstract = {The increasing problem of antimicrobial resistance in N. gonorrhoeae necessitates the development of molecular typing schemes that are suitable for rapid and mass screening. The objective of this study was to design and validate a mini-MLST scheme for N. gonorrhoeae based on global pathogen population data. Using sequences of seven housekeeping genes of 21,402 isolates with known MLSTs from the PubMLST database, we identified eighteen informative polymorphisms and obtained mini-MLST nucleotide profiles to predict MLSTs of isolates. We proposed a new MLST grouping system for N. gonorrhoeae based on mini-MLST profiles. Phylogenetic analysis revealed that MLST genogroups are a stable characteristic of the N. gonorrhoeae global population. The proposed grouping system has been shown to bring together isolates with similar antimicrobial susceptibility, as demonstrated by the characteristics of major genogroups. Established MLST prediction algorithms based on nucleotide profiles are now publicly available. The mini-MLST scheme was evaluated using a MLST detection/prediction method based on the original hydrogel DNA microarray. The results confirmed a high predictive ability up to the MLST genogroup. The proposed holistic approach to gonococcal population analysis can be used for the continuous surveillance of known and emerging resistant N. gonorrhoeae isolates.},

Maternal 3rd trimester and cord blood were obtained to determine the anti-S. aureus IgG and anti-α-toxin (Hla) neutralizing antibody (NAb) titers. Serial surveys and skin swabs were obtained from mothers at enrollment and from infants longitudinally to ascertain S. aureus colonization status and the incidence of SSTI.63 pregnant women were enrolled, 54\% with history of SSTI or asymptomatic S. aureus colonization at enrollment. Within 48-hours of delivery, 23\% of infants had S. aureus colonization and 43\% at 1-month. Maternal S. aureus colonization resulted in 7.4 increased odds of infant colonization at delivery. Higher cord blood anti-Hla Nab titer was associated with significantly lower risk for infant SSTI in the first year of life.S. aureus colonization occurs early in life, with over 40\% of infants colonized by 1-month. These results are the first to demonstrate an association between higher transplacental anti-Hla NAb and protection against infant SSTI in the first year of life. Overall, these findings support Hla as a promising vaccine target.},

In the present study, a Gram-negative organism was isolated from ailing pigeons with respiratory infection from a farm in Tamil Nadu, India and the organism was misidentified as Burkholderia mallei by Vitek 2 compact system based on biochemical characterization. Since, B. mallei is highly pathogenic and zoonotic, to further confirm, 16S rDNA sequencing and analysis was carried out which revealed that the strain belonged to Bisgaard taxon 14 (Spirabiliibacterium mucosae). To further confirm the findings, whole genome sequencing of the isolate was performed. Whole genome phylogeny and average nucleotide identity (ANI) analysis showed that the genome was closely matching with Spirabiliibacterium mucosae type strain 20,609 /3. Hence, the strain from pigeon was named as Spirabiliibacterium mucosae TN\_CUL\_2021 and the genome was submitted in NCBI SRA database. The genome of S. mucosase TN\_CUL\_2021 is only the second genome available worldwide in the NCBI database.

 abstract = {Introduction
Warts are dermal disorders resulting from HPV infection and can be transmitted by direct contact. Existing treatment approaches, such as topical treatment with salicylate, have low efficiency and demonstrate side effects. Thus, the discovery of potent drug treatments for skin warts is necessary. Here we propose the use of alternative medications for the possible treatment of skin warts with the help of comparative transcriptome analysis and drug repurposing approaches.
Methods
Gene expression datasets related to HPV-induced warts and cervical cancer were extracted from the GEO database. Differentially expressed genes (DEGs) were identified using DESeq2 in the Galaxy database. Upregulated DEGs were assessed for druggability using the DGIdb tool. Gene ontology and enrichment analysis were performed to investigate the characteristics of druggable DEGs. A molecular docking virtual screening was conducted using PyRx software to identify potential therapeutic targets for skin warts. The interactions between selected drug candidates and the target protein were analyzed using the BIOVIA Discovery Studio. The physicochemical characteristics of potential pharmaceuticals were evaluated using the SwissADME database. Finally, the molecular dynamics (MD) simulation was performed to validate the stability and dynamic behavior of drug-protein interactions.
Results
Based on the findings from gene expression profiling, Integrin Alpha-X (ITGAX, CD11c) has been identified as a candidate protein that is significantly upregulated in individuals afflicted with skin warts. Integrin Alpha-X plays a crucial role in mediating intercellular interactions during inflammatory processes and notably enhances the adhesion and chemotactic activity of monocytes. Through molecular docking, MD, and physicochemical analyses, it has been demonstrated that dihydroergotamine effectively inhibits the ITGAX protein, suggesting its potential as a therapeutic agent for the management of skin warts.
Conclusion
Dihydroergotamine can be repurposed as a potential drug in the treatment of skin warts by targeting Integrin Alpha-X protein.},

 abstract = {The epidermis of Caenorhabditis elegans is an essential tissue for survival because it contributes to the formation of the cuticle barrier as well as facilitating developmental progression and animal growth. Most of the epidermis consists of the hyp7 hypodermal syncytium, the nuclei of which are largely generated by the seam cells, which exhibit stem cell-like behaviour during development. How seam cell progenitors differ transcriptionally from the differentiated hypodermis is poorly understood. Here, we introduce Targeted DamID (TaDa) in C. elegans as a method for identifying genes expressed within a tissue of interest without cell isolation. We show that TaDa signal enrichment profiles can be used to identify genes transcribed in the epidermis and use this method to resolve differences in gene expression between the seam cells and the hypodermis. Finally, we predict and functionally validate new transcription and chromatin factors acting in seam cell development. These findings provide insights into cell type-specific gene expression profiles likely associated with epidermal cell fate patterning.},

We introduce here targeted DamID (TaDa) as a method for tissue-specific transcription factor target identification in intact \textit{Caenorhabditis elegans} animals. We use TaDa to recover targets in the epidermis for two factors, the HES1 homolog LIN-22, and the NR5A1/2 nuclear hormone receptor NHR-25. We demonstrate a direct link between LIN-22 and the Wnt signaling pathway through repression of the Frizzled receptor \textit{lin-17}. We report a direct role for NHR-25 in promoting cell differentiation via repressing the expression of stem cell-promoting GATA factors. Our results expand our understanding of the epidermal gene network and highlight the potential of TaDa to dissect the architecture of tissue-specific gene regulatory networks.},

 abstract = {Plant-specific BURP domain-containing proteins have an essential role in the plant's development and stress responses. Although BURP domain-containing proteins have been identified in several plant species, genome-wide analysis of the BURP gene family has not been investigated in the common bean. In the present study, we identified 11 BURP family members in the common bean (\textit{Phaseolus vulgaris}) genome with a comprehensive in silico analysis. Pairwise alignment and phylogenetic analyses grouped \textit{PvBURP} members into four subfamilies [RD-22 like (3), PG1β-like (4), BNM2-like (3), and USP-like (1)] according to their amino acid motifs, protein domains and intron-exon structure. The physical and biochemical characteristics of amino acids, motif and intron-exon structure, and \textit{cis}-regulatory elements of BURPs members were determined. Promoter regions of BURP members included stress, light, and hormone response-related cis-elements. Therefore, expression profiles of \textit{PvBURP} genes were identified with in silico tools and qRT-PCR analyses under stress (salt and drought) and hormone treatment (ABA, IAA) in the current study. While significant activity changes were not observed in BURP genes in RNA-seq data sets related to salt stress, it was determined that some BURP genes were expressed differently in those with drought stress. We identified 12 different miRNA, including miRNA395, miRNA156, miRNA169, miRNA171, miRNA319, and miRNA390, targeting the nine \textit{PvBURP} genes using two different in silico tools based on perfect or near-perfect complementarity to their targets. Here we present the first study to identify and characterize the \textit{BURP} genes in common bean using whole-genome analysis, and the findings may serve as a reference for future functional research in common bean.{\textless}h4{\textgreater}Supplementary information{\textless}/h4{\textgreater}The online version contains supplementary material available at 10.1007/s12298-021-01052-9.},

 abstract = {The domain of unknown function (DUF221 domain-containing) proteins regulates various aspects of plant growth, development, responses to abiotic stresses, and hormone transduction pathways. A comprehensive genome-wide analysis was performed in its genome to understand the role of DDP genes (DUF221) in the common bean (Phaseolus vulgaris L.). A total of 12 DDP genes were identified and distributed in 8 chromosomes in the common bean genome. The physical and biochemical characteristics of amino acids, motif and intron–exon structure, and cis-regulatory elements of DDP members were determined. Phylogenetically all PvDDPs were clustered into nine clades, subsequently supported by their gene structure and conserved motifs distribution. The PvDDPs contained various cis-acting elements involved in plant responses to abiotic and various phytohormones stresses. A total of 45 different cis-regulatory elements in the putative promoter regions of the PvDDPs were identified. ERE and ABRE were discovered to be present in all PvDDPs, indicating that they may be regulated by ethylene and ABA, both of which are strongly associated with biotic stress response in plant species. Additionally, PvDDPs were targeted by multiple miRNA gene families as well. In this context, the most targeted DDP family members are PvDD10 and PvDDP11. The miRNA target analysis showed that Pvu-miR2594, Pvu-miR169, Pvu-miR2584, Pvu-miR530, Pvu-miR156, and Pvu-miR2592 target these genes. There is a strong correlation between abiotic stress and PvDDPs expression in both leaf and root tissues. PvDDP11 is the unique and highest upregulated gene with hormone treatment and abiotic stress among all the members. Expression of the PvDDP11 gene indicated a strong correlation with drought and salt stress in the common bean roots and leaves, respectively. In conclusion, this study predicted that the putative DDP genes might help improve abiotic and phytohormone tolerance in common bean.},

@phdthesis{kefi_improving_2023,
 abstract = {The Human Genome Annotation (HGA) file is a database where different features describing elements of the genome (genes, transcripts, etc) are stored. HGA is the process of identifying those elements, characterizing them and elucidating their roles. Currently, HGA is still incomplete because it suffers from missed annotation and mis-annotation. Mis-annotation happens when some elements are wrongly annotated or labeled. Missed annotation happens when some elements are absent from the annotation files due to the limitations of analytical and experimental procedures. On one hand, improved identification of novel genome elements is required to help solve the problem of missed annotation. On the other hand, to address the problem of mis-annotation, better classification methods are needed to characterize and validate the novel elements. This thesis addresses the problem of incomplete human genome annotation and proposes an improved identification and validation approach via integration of second and third generation of sequencing. We apply this integrative approach to detect novel mono-exonic genes (MNEGs) and confirm their transcription and translation. Up until recent studies, MNEGs were thought to be artifacts and were discarded. However, our integrative analysis provided additional evidence for the genuine existence of these genes. In the second part of this project, we used computational methods based on a deep learning framework to validate these findings by characterizing MNEG types and classifying them into either proteins coding RNAs (pcRNAs) or long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs). Our results showed that the majority of MNEGs are classified as lncRNAs and further investigation suggested that some of them are circRNAs. Finally, this work provides an innovative approach and a unique computational framework to address the problem of incomplete HGA and could be adopted by the annotators in their pipelines. This study is an important step towards the completion and the improvement of the human genome annotation.},

 abstract = {Very long-chain fatty acids (VLCFAs) possess more than twenty carbon atoms and are the major components of seed storage oil, wax, and lipids. FAE (Fatty Acid Elongation) like genes take part in the biosynthesis of VLCFAs, growth regulation, and stress responses, and are further comprised of KCS (Ketoacyl-CoA synthase) and ELO (Elongation Defective Elongase) sub-gene families. The comparative genome-wide analysis and mode of evolution of KCS and ELO gene families have not been investigated in tetraploid Brassica carinata and its diploid progenitors. In this study, 53 KCS genes were identified in B. carinata compared to 32 and 33 KCS genes in B. nigra and B. oleracea respectively, which suggests that polyploidization might has impacted the fatty acid elongation process during Brassica evolution. Polyploidization has also increased the number of ELO genes in B. carinata (17) over its progenitors B. nigra (7) and B. oleracea (6). Based on comparative phylogenetics, KCS, and ELO proteins can be classified into eight and four major groups, respectively. The approximate date of divergence for duplicated KCS and ELO genes varied from 0.03 to 3.20 million years ago (MYA). Gene structure analysis indicated that the maximum number of genes were intron-less and remained conserved during evolution. The neutral type of selection seemed to be predominant in both KCS and ELO genes evolution. String-based protein-protein interaction analysis suggested that bZIP53, a transcription factor might be involved in the activation of transcription of ELO/KCS genes. The presence of biotic and abiotic stress-related cis-regulatory elements in the promoter region suggests that both KCS and ELO genes might also play their role in stress tolerance. The expression analysis of both gene family members reflect their preferential seed-specific expression, especially during the mature embryo development stage. Furthermore, some KCS and ELO genes were found to be specifically expressed under heat stress, phosphorus starvation, and Xanthomonas campestris infection. The current study provides a basis to understand the evolution of both KCS and ELO genes in fatty acid elongation and their role in stress tolerance.},

Insights into the molecular basis of chemotherapy-induced cachexia is essential to improve treatment strategies. Here, we demonstrated that Sorafenib-tyrosine kinase inhibitor (TKI) class of chemotherapeutic agents-induced cachexia. System-wide analyses revealed that Sorafenib alters the global transcriptional program and proteostasis in muscle cells. Mechanistically, Sorafenib treatment reduced active epigenetic mark H3K4 methylation on distinct muscle-specific genes by impeding chromatin association of SET1A-catalytic component of the SET1/MLL histone methyltransferase complex. This mechanism favored transcriptional disorientation that led to disrupted sarcomere assembly, calcium homeostasis and mitochondrial respiration. Consequently, the contractile ability of muscle cells was severely compromised. Interestingly, the other prominent TKIs Nilotinib and Imatinib did not exert similar effects on muscle cell physiology. Collectively, we identified an unanticipated transcriptional mechanism underlying Sorafenib-induced cachexia. Our findings hold the potential to strategize therapy regimens to minimize chemotherapy-induced cachexia.},

Whole genome hybrid sequencing was applied to six mcr-positive E. coli (MCRPE) strains isolated from pigs, a farmworker and wastewater collected between 2017 and 2019. Among these, mcr-1.1 genes were identified on IncI2 plasmids from a pig and wastewater, and on IncX4 from the human isolate, whereas mcr-3 genes were found on plasmids IncFII and IncHI2 in two porcine strains. The MCRPE isolates exhibited genotypic and phenotypic multidrug resistance (MDR) traits as well as heavy metal and antiseptic resistance genes. The mcr-1.1-IncI2 and IncX4 plasmids carried only colistin resistance genes. Whereas, the mcr-3.5-IncHI2 plasmid presented MDR region, with several mobile genetic elements. Despite the MCRPE strains belonged to different E. coli lineages, mcr-carrying plasmids with high similarities were found in isolates from pigs and wastewater recovered in different years. This study highlighted that several factors, including the resistomic profile of the host bacteria, co-selection via adjunct antibiotic resistance genes, antiseptics, and/or disinfectants, and plasmid-host fitness adaptation may encourage the maintenance of plasmids carrying mcr genes in E. coli.},

Bacterial species were identified using MALDI-TOF, and antimicrobial resistance was confirmed through broth microdilution testing. Genetic analyses included plasmid replicon typing, multilocus sequence typing (MLST), whole genome sequencing (WGS), and pulsed-field gel electrophoresis (PFGE) to assess resistance genes and clonal relatedness.ResultsCRE isolates from both species exhibited genetic variability with high ARG counts, particularly in human isolates. MLST identified ST410 in most E. coli isolates from both dogs and humans, and IncFIA/IncFIB plasmids were predominant among blaNDM-positive isolates. PFGE patterns and SNP analysis showed no clonal relationship between canine and human isolates, suggesting independent acquisition pathways for CRE in the two hosts.DiscussionThe study highlights the absence of direct clonal transmission between canine and human isolates but reveals overlapping sequence types and plasmid types. The findings underscore the potential for interspecies transmission under certain conditions, emphasizing the importance of a One Health approach for monitoring CRE in both human and animal populations.},

 abstract = {Antibiotic resistance is a worldwide problem that imposes a devastating effect on developing countries and requires immediate interventions. Initially, most of the antibiotic drugs were identified by culturing soil microbes. However, this method is prone to discovering the same antibiotics repeatedly. The present study employed a shotgun metagenomics approach to investigate the taxonomic diversity, functional potential, and biosynthetic capacity of microbiomes from two natural agricultural farmlands located in Bekeka and Welmera Choke Kebelle in Ethiopia for the first time. Analysis of the small subunit rRNA revealed bacterial domain accounting for 83.33\% and 87.24\% in the two selected natural farmlands. Additionally, the analysis showed the dominance of Proteobacteria representing 27.27\% and 28.79\% followed by Actinobacteria making up 12.73\% and 13.64\% of the phyla composition. Furthermore, the analysis revealed the presence of unassigned bacteria in the studied samples. The metagenome functional analysis showed 176,961 and 104, 636 number of protein-coding sequences (pCDS) from the two samples found a match with 172,655 and 102, 275 numbers of InterPro entries, respectively. The Genome ontology annotation suggests the presence of 5517 and 3293 pCDS assigned to the “biosynthesis process”. Numerous Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes modules (KEGG modules) involved in the biosynthesis of terpenoids and polyketides were identified. Furthermore, both known and novel Biosynthetic gene clusters, responsible for the production of secondary metabolites, such as polyketide synthases, non-ribosomal peptide synthetase, ribosomally synthesized and post-translationally modified peptides (Ripp), and Terpene, were discovered. Generally, from the results it can be concluded that the microbiomes in the selected sampling sites have a hidden functional potential for the biosynthesis of secondary metabolites. Overall, this study can serve as a strong preliminary step in the long journey of bringing new antibiotics to the market.},

 abstract = {Histone modification is a key epigenetic mechanism for regulation of chromatin dynamics and gene expression. Deleted in breast cancer 1 (DBC1) has been shown to act as a negative regulator of epigenetic modifiers and as a co-activator for nuclear receptors and other transcription factors. However, little is known about the role of DBC1 in the regulation of histone modifications and chromatin landscapes. Here, we analyzed genome-wide profiles of active enhancer and promoter marks in colorectal cancer cells and report DBC1 as a critical positive regulator of histone epigenetic writers KMT2D (H3K4 methyltransferase) and p300 (histone acetyltransferase). DBC1 is required for establishing the landscape of active enhancers, for genome-wide chromatin binding and enhancer recruitment of KMT2D and p300, and for gene activation involved in colorectal cancer progression. DBC1 interacts directly with KMT2D and p300, and enhances KMT2D-mediated histone H3K4 methylation (H3K4me1/2/3) and p300-mediated H3 acetylation. Importantly, DBC1 contributes to super-enhancer formation and function by facilitating the recruitment of KMT2D and p300 and by enhancing their functional interaction and cooperative cross-talk. Our results highlight the critical role of DBC1 as a key positive regulator of KMT2D and p300, and provide insights into regulatory mechanisms underlying the interplay between the enhancer epigenomic writers in enhancer activation.},

 abstract = {The commonly used arabinose- and rhamnose-inducible Escherichia coli promoters, PBAD and PRha, exhibit tight regulation through activation via their respective transcription factors, AraC and RhaS, alongside the cyclic AMP receptor protein. The mechanisms of these promoters have been characterized on a parts level, but nucleotide-level analysis has yet to be elucidated. Therefore, we describe here a massively parallel reporter assay that maps regulatory sites at the nucleotide level. The relative importance of nucleotides in each binding site is revealed, including loci not included in previous annotations. For PBAD, we confirm known sites and reveal novel binding sites involved in modulating gene expression. In PRha, we refine the length and sequence specificity of rhaI half-sites, updating previous annotations and providing nucleotide level insights into RhaS-mediated regulation. Mutations that lead to increased promoter strength, wider dynamic range, and altered basal expression are identified for both promoters. Engineered versions of PBAD and PRha promoters based on this data show improvements in dynamic range alongside a seven- and three-fold increase in promoter strength, respectively, with a slight increase in basal expression for the PBAD promoters and no significant increase for PRha. This work expands the genetic parts “toolkit” and increases the understanding of these important commonly used promoters.},

 abstract = {An amino acid exchange (P209L) in the HSPB8 binding site of the human co-chaperone BAG3 gives rise to severe childhood cardiomyopathy. To phenocopy the disease in mice and gain insight into its mechanisms, we generated humanized transgenic mouse models. Expression of human BAG3P209L-eGFP in mice caused Z-disc disintegration and formation of protein aggregates. This was accompanied by massive fibrosis resulting in early-onset restrictive cardiomyopathy with increased mortality as observed in patients. RNA-Seq and proteomics revealed changes in the protein quality control system and increased autophagy in hearts from hBAG3P209L-eGFP mice. The mutation renders hBAG3P209L less soluble in vivo and induces protein aggregation, but does not abrogate hBAG3 binding properties. In conclusion, we report a mouse model mimicking the human disease. Our data suggest that the disease mechanism is due to accumulation of hBAG3P209L and mouse Bag3, causing sequestering of components of the protein quality control system and autophagy machinery leading to sarcomere disruption.},

 abstract = {Mantis shrimp (order Stomatopoda) are known for their aggressive nature and powerful raptorial appendages. Among them, the Philippine mantis shrimp Gonodactylaceus falcatus is suspected to comprise a cryptic species complex with 6 primary synonyms. This study aims to explore this complex focusing on G. falcatus ‘sensu stricto’ and three of its primary synonyms: G. insularis, G. mutatus, and G. siamensis. Complete mitochondrial genomes were fully assembled using Illumina sequencing. The AT-rich studied mitogenomes ranged from 15,894 to 16,267 bp in length. Each contains 13 protein-coding genes, 22 transfer RNA genes, 2 ribosomal RNA genes, and one control region. Mitochondrial synteny is identical to previously reported stomatopod mitogenomes, except Gonodactylus smithii. In all studied species, 21 of the 22 tRNA genes were predicted to have the typical ‘cloverleaf’ structure: trnS1 either lacked a D-arm or both a D-arm and D-loop. All mitochondrial protein-coding genes experience purifying selection, noting a Ka/Ks value for the G. insularis nad4l gene was not calculated due to the absence of non-synonymous substitutions. AT-rich di- and tri-nucleotide microsatellites were found in all studied control regions while short tandem repeats were detected in all except G. insularis. Phylomitogenomic analysis supports the monophyly of the order Stomatopoda but not the superfamilies Gonodactyloidea, Lysiosquilloidea, and Squilloidea. Furthermore, phylogenomic placement and genetic distances supported the species status of G. insularis and G. mutatus but not G. siamensis. Our study provides genomic resources to continue improving knowledge of cryptic species complexes in the order Stomatopoda.},

We found that OLFM4 expression is transiently upregulated in the proliferative phase of cutaneous wound healing in humans as well as in mice. Moreover, a significant increase in OLFM4 expression was detected in the skin of lesional psoriasis, a chronic inflammatory disease characterized by keratinocyte hyperproliferation. In vitro experiments demonstrated that OLFM4 selectively stimulated keratinocyte proliferation and increased both keratinocyte and fibroblast migration. Using proteotranscriptomic pathway analysis we revealed that transcription factors POU5F1/OCT4 and ESR1 acted as hubs for OLFM4-induced signalling in keratinocytes. In vivo experiments utilizing mouse splinted full-thickness cutaneous wound healing model showed that application of recombinant OLFM4 protein can significantly improve wound healing efficacy. Taken together, our results suggest that OLFM4 acts as a transiently upregulated inflammatory signal that promotes wound healing by regulating both dermal and epidermal cell compartments of the skin.},

By using a combined proteotranscriptomic pathway analysis approach we discovered that β-catenin acted as a hub for THBS4-dependent cell signaling and likely plays a key role in promoting its downstream effects.

Currently, it is unknown which human dorsal root ganglion (DRG) neurons express the receptors of these pruritogens, MRGPRD and MRGPRX1, respectively, and which cutaneous afferents these pruritogens activate in primate. In situ hybridization studies revealed that MRGPRD and MRGPRX1 are co-expressed in a subpopulation of TRPV1+ human DRG neurons. In electrophysiological recordings in nonhuman primates (\textit{Macaca nemestrina}), subtypes of polymodal C-fiber nociceptors are preferentially activated by ALA and BAM8-22, with significant overlap. When pruritogens ALA, BAM8-22, and histamine, which activate different subclasses of C-fiber afferents, are administered in combination, human volunteers report itch and nociceptive sensations similar to those induced by a single pruritogen. Our results provide evidence for differences in pruriceptive processing between primates and rodents, and do not support the spatial contrast theory of coding of itch and pain.},

It finds application in comparative and functional genomics, phylogenomics, and evolutionary reconstructions. With a rapidly increasing number of available genomes, the demand for large-scale predictions is also growing. In this contribution, we evaluate and implement major algorithmic improvements that significantly enhance the speed of the analysis without reducing precision. Graph-based detection of (co-)orthologs is typically based on a reciprocal best alignment heuristic that requires an all vs. all comparison of proteins from all species under study. The initial identification of similar proteins is accelerated by introducing an alternative search tool along with a revised search strategy—the pseudo-reciprocal best alignment heuristic—that reduces the number of required sequence comparisons by one-half.

 abstract = {WRKY transcription factors (TFs) play significant roles in plant development. However, they have not yet been studied in terms of the impact they have on the common fig (Ficus carica L.), a significant fruit species in Mediterranean countries. In this study, we extensively examined the full-genome F. carica WRKY (FcWRKYs) gene complement (47 genes), in terms of gene structure, protein domains and motifs, physicochemical properties, phylogenetic relationships and selection pressure. Based on the structural properties of the encoded proteins, we grouped the FcWRKY genes into three main groups (I, II and III), with the second group being further divided into five subgroups (a–e). Subgroup IId FcWRKY proteins were discovered to contain the Plant zinc cluster (Plant-zn-clust) domain and Ca2+-dependent Calmodulin (CaM)-binding domain (CaMBD). In total, we discovered ten conserved motifs, seven of which may be associated with WRKY functional specificities attributable to a single group or a small number of groups. Phylogenetically related members shared similar exon–intron structure, with the average number of exons being higher ({\textasciitilde} 5) in (sub)groups I, IIa, IIb compared to IIc, IId, IIe and III ({\textasciitilde} 3). Comparative phylogeny using the mulberry WRKY gene complement (MnWRKYs) revealed 38 pairs of orthologous genes shared by both species, which diverged from 84.3 to 25.3 million years ago (Mya) and have been evolving under purifying selection that was weaker on group III genes, suggesting an important role of this group in the enlargement of the adaptive array of WRKY TFs. RNA-seq results revealed that genes that were highly expressed in the peel across all fruit developmental stages belonged to group I and subgroups IIb, IIc, IId and IIe, suggesting the role played by these members in fruit peel development. RT-qPCR validated this profile and further showed that three genes FcWRKY25 (IIc), FcWRKY31 (IIb), and FcWRKY39 (IIc) are clearly more overexpressed during color acquisition in the Tunisian dark cultivar ‘Zidi’, in comparison with the light purple cultivar ‘Soltani’, presenting these three genes as potential contributors to the changes in biochemical compounds in the fig peel during fruit maturation. The knowledge framework provided by our study will be a valuable asset in the functional exploration of candidate genes that may be associated with fruit quality.},

 abstract = {MCM1-AGAMOUS-DEFICIENS-SRF (MADS)-box transcription factors (TFs) regulate a variety of plant developmental processes, particularly floral organ identity and fruit ripening. However, little is known about the MADS-box TF family in the common fig (Ficus carica L.), a vital fruit crop of Mediterranean countries. Here, we report a comprehensive overview of the MADS-box genes and their TF products in fig, describing their classification, physicochemical properties, protein and gene architectures, phylogenetic relationships, selection mode and differential expression during fruit development. A total of 64 MADS-box members were identified in F. carica and phylogenetically categorized as either type I (30) or type II (34). Type I MADS-box TFs were divided into three families (Mα, Mβ and Mγ, with 16, 4 and 10 members, respectively), whereas type II TFs were classified into two families (MIKCC and MIKC*, with 29 and 5 members, respectively). MIKCC TFs could be further classified into 12 subfamilies. Most FcMADS genes within the same clade were characterized by similar exon–intron organizations and motif compositions. Comparative phylogenetic analysis using mulberry (Morus notabilis) identified 24 (18 type II and 6 type I) orthologs between F. carica and M. notabilis. In addition, 11 paralogous MADS-box gene pairs were identified in F. carica, which evolved under purifying selection, except for two recent paralogs from the TM3 (SOC1) subfamily. RNA-seq results indicated that 28 and 34 FcMADS genes were differentially expressed in fruit peel and female flowers, respectively, during six successive stages of fruit development. According to their expression profiles, genes were grouped into four clusters (I, II, III and IV) in both tissues. FcMADS genes from fruit peel expression cluster IV (FcMADS13, -23, -32, -40 and -60) and female flower expression cluster III (FcMADS9, -49 and -58) were upregulated during fruit ripening in the corresponding tissues, suggesting a potential, tissue-specific role of these candidate genes in fruit ripening. Our findings provide the first genome-wide extended characterization of the MADS-box TF family in F. carica, laying the groundwork for future research on its molecular roles in fruit ripening.},

 abstract = {According to the World Health Organization, carbapenem-resistant \textit{Enterobacteriaceae} (CRE) belong to the highest priority group for the development of new antibiotics. Argentina-WHONET data showed that Gram-negative resistance frequencies to imipenem have been increasing since 2010 mostly in two CRE bacteria: \textit{Klebsiella pneumoniae} and \textit{Enterobacter cloacae} Complex (ECC). This scenario is mirrored in our hospital. It is known that \textit{K. pneumoniae} and the ECC coexist in the human body, but little is known about the outcome of these species producing KPC, and colonizing or infecting a patient. We aimed to contribute to the understanding of the rise of the ECC in Argentina, taking as a biological model both a patient colonized with two KPC-producing strains (one \textit{Enterobacter hormaechei} and one \textit{K. pneumoniae}) and \textit{in vitro} competition assays with prevalent KPC-producing ECC (KPC-ECC) versus KPC-producing \textit{K. pneumoniae} (KPC-Kp) high-risk clones from our institution. A KPC-producing \textit{E. hormaechei} and later a KPC-Kp strain that colonized a patient shared an identical novel conjugative IncM1 plasmid harboring \textit{bla} $_{\textrm{KPC-2}}$. In addition, a total of 19 KPC-ECC and 58 KPC-Kp strains isolated from nosocomial infections revealed that high-risk clones KPC-ECC ST66 and ST78 as well as KPC-Kp ST11 and ST258 were prevalent and selected for competition assays. The competition assays with KCP-ECC ST45, ST66, and ST78 versus KPC-Kp ST11, ST18, and ST258 strains analyzed here showed no statistically significant difference. These assays evidenced that high-risk clones of KPC-ECC and KPC-Kp can coexist in the same hospital environment including the same patient, which explains from an ecological point of view that both species can exchange and share plasmids. These findings offer hints to explain the worldwide rise of KPC-ECC strains based on the ability of some pandemic clones to compete and occupy a certain niche. Taken together, the presence of the same new plasmid and the fitness results that showed that both strains can coexist within the same patient suggest that horizontal genetic transfer of \textit{bla} $_{\textrm{KPC-2}}$ within the patient cannot be ruled out. These findings highlight the constant interaction that these two species can keep in the hospital environment, which, in turn, can be related to the spread of KPC.},

 abstract = {Protein expression is a primary area of interest for routine histological diagnostics and tissue-based research projects, but the limitations of its post-mortem applicability remain largely unclear. On the other hand, tissue specimens obtained during autopsies can provide unique insight into advanced disease states, especially in cancer research. Therefore, we aimed to identify the maximum post-mortem interval (PMI) which is still suitable for characterizing protein expression patterns, to explore organ-specific differences in protein degradation, and to investigate whether certain proteins follow specific degradation kinetics. Therefore, the proteome of human tissue samples obtained during routine autopsies of deceased patients with accurate PMI (6, 12, 18, 24, 48, 72, 96 h) and without specific diseases that significantly affect tissue preservation, from lungs, kidneys and livers, was analyzed by liquid chromatography–tandem mass spectrometry (LC–MS/MS). For the kidney and liver, significant protein degradation became apparent at 48 h. For the lung, the proteome composition was rather static for up to 48 h and substantial protein degradation was detected only at 72 h suggesting that degradation kinetics appear to be organ specific. More detailed analyses suggested that proteins with similar post-mortem kinetics are not primarily shared in their biological functions. The overrepresentation of protein families with analogous structural motifs in the kidney indicates that structural features may be a common factor in determining similar postmortem stability. Our study demonstrates that a longer post-mortem period may have a significant impact on proteome composition, but sampling within 24 h may be appropriate, as degradation is within acceptable limits even in organs with faster autolysis.},

@article{koeberle_silybin_2025,
 abstract = {\textbf{Rationale:} \textit{Silybum marianum} is used to protect against degenerative liver damage. The molecular mechanisms of its bioactive component, silybin, remained enigmatic, although membrane-stabilizing properties, modulation of membrane protein function, and metabolic regulation have been discussed for decades. \textbf{Methods}: Experiments were performed with hepatocyte cell lines and primary monocytes \textit{in vitro} under both basal and stressed conditions, and in mice \textit{in vivo}. Quantitative lipidomics was used to detect changes in phospholipids and triglycerides. Key findings were confirmed by Western blotting, quantitative PCR, microscopy, enzyme activity assays, metabolic flux studies, and functional relationships were investigated using selective inhibitors. \textbf{Results}: We show that specifically the stereoisomer silybin A decreases triglyceride levels and lipid droplet content, while enriching major phospholipid classes and maintaining a homeostatic phospholipid composition in human hepatocytes \textit{in vitro} and in mouse liver \textit{in vivo} under normal and pre-disease conditions. Conversely, in cell-based disease models of lipid overload and lipotoxic stress, silybin treatment primarily depletes triglycerides. Mechanistically, silymarin/silybin suppresses phospholipid-degrading enzymes, induces phospholipid biosynthesis to varying degrees depending on the conditions, and down-regulates triglyceride remodeling/biosynthesis, while inducing complex changes in sterol and fatty acid metabolism. Structure-activity relationship studies highlight the importance of the 1,4-benzodioxane ring configuration of silybin A in triglyceride reduction and the saturated 2,3-bond of the flavanonol moiety in phospholipid accumulation. Enrichment of hepatic phospholipids and intracellular membrane expansion are associated with a heightened biotransformation capacity. \textbf{Conclusion}: Our study deciphers the structural features of silybin contributing to hepatic lipid remodeling and suggests that silymarin/silybin protects the liver in individuals with mild metabolic dysregulation, involving a lipid class switch from triglycerides to phospholipids, whereas it may be less effective in disease states associated with severe metabolic dysregulation.},

 abstract = {Liquid chromatography coupled with bottom-up mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS)-based proteomics is a versatile technology for identifying and quantifying proteins in complex biological mixtures. Postidentification, analysis of changes in protein abundances between conditions requires increasingly complex and specialized statistical methods. Many of these methods, in particular the family of open-source Bioconductor packages MSstats, are implemented in a coding language such as R. To make the methods in MSstats accessible to users with limited programming and statistical background, we have created MSstatsShiny, an R-Shiny graphical user interface (GUI) integrated with MSstats, MSstatsTMT, and MSstatsPTM. The GUI provides a point and click analysis pipeline applicable to a wide variety of proteomics experimental types, including label-free data-dependent acquisitions (DDAs) or data-independent acquisitions (DIAs), or tandem mass tag (TMT)-based TMT-DDAs, answering questions such as relative changes in the abundance of peptides, proteins, or post-translational modifications (PTMs). To support reproducible research, the application saves user’s selections and builds an R script that programmatically recreates the analysis. MSstatsShiny can be installed locally via Github and Bioconductor, or utilized on the cloud at www.msstatsshiny.com. We illustrate the utility of the platform using two experimental data sets (MassIVE IDs MSV000086623 and MSV000085565).},

Cancer cells exhibiting higher sensitivity to austocystin D often display elevated CYP2J2 expression. However, the essentiality and the role of CYP2J2 for the cytotoxicity of this compound remain unclear. In this study, we demonstrate that CYP2J2 depletion alleviates austocystin D sensitivity and DNA damage induction, while CYP2J2 overexpression enhances them. Moreover, the investigation into genes involved in austocystin D cytotoxicity identified POR and PGRMC1, positive regulators for CYP activity, and KAT7, a histone acetyltransferase. Through genetic manipulation and analysis of multiomics data, we elucidated a role for KAT7 in CYP2J2 transcriptional regulation. These findings strongly suggest that CYP2J2 is crucial for austocystin D metabolism and its subsequent cytotoxic effects. The potential use of austocystin D as a therapeutic prodrug is underscored, particularly in cancers where elevated CYP2J2 expression serves as a biomarker.},

 abstract = {Skip to Next Section
The Malpighian tubules (MTs) and hindgut constitute the functional kidney of insects. MTs are outpouchings of the gut and in most insects demonstrate proximodistal heterogeneity in function. In most insects, such heterogeneity is confined to ion/fluid secretion in the distal portion and ion/fluid reabsorption in the proximal portion. In contrast, MTs of larval Lepidoptera (caterpillars of butterflies and moths) are composed of five regions that differ in their association with the gut, their structure and ion/fluid transport function. Recent studies have shown that several regions can rapidly and reversibly switch between ion secretion and reabsorption. The present study employed RNAseq, pharmacology and electrophysiology to characterize four distinct regions of the MT in larval Trichoplusia ni. Luminal microelectrode measurements indicate changes in [K+], [Na+] and pH as fluid passes through different regions of the tubule. In addition, the regions examined differ in gene ontology enrichment, and demonstrate robust gradients in expression of ion transporters and endocrine ligand receptors. Lastly, the study provides evidence for direct involvement of voltage- and ligand-gated ion channels in epithelial ion transport of insect MTs.},

 abstract = {Urinary tract infections are commonly caused by uropathogenic Escherichia coli (UPEC). Due to the emergence of multidrug-resistant UPEC, rendering antibiotic treatment ineffective, phage combination-based therapy has been proposed as a potential alternative. Here, we present a formulation of a genetically diverse phage-derived cocktail that is rapidly customized for UPEC using E. coli UTI89 as a model strain. Through our rapid selection and combination of four phages against UPEC strain UTI89 (SR01, SR02, SR04, and Zappy) from our library, the combination of two lytic phages, SR02 and SR04, exhibits the strongest suppression of bacterial growth for at least 16 h, with no emergence of phage resistance observed in vitro. Phage SR02 undergoes subcellular activity for 25 min, producing approximately 106 progeny particles per cell, while SR04 completes its replication cycle in 20 min, generating around 564 progeny particles per cell. These two novel phages are genetically diverse, and their cocktail exhibited potent suppression of bacterial growth, independent of multiplicities of infection (MOIs), significantly reducing the viable bacterial counts after treatment in vitro. The phage cocktail has low immunogenicity and does not induce any proinflammatory gene responses in human bladder uroepithelial cells. Moreover, the cocktail effectively eradicates the invading UPEC strain UTI89 in the uroepithelial cells at a comparable level to that of phage SR04 alone, likely releasing some immunostimulatory agents that, in turn, trigger upregulation of MIP-3 and IL-8 genes. Altogether, this study offers an alternative pipeline for rapidly formulating genetically diverse phage-derived cocktails, which is specifically customized for targeted bacteria.},

 abstract = {{\textless}p{\textgreater}The Src family kinases (SFKs) Lck and Lyn are crucial for lymphocyte development and function. Albeit tissue-restricted expression patterns the two kinases share common functions; the most pronounced one being the phosphorylation of ITAM motifs in the cytoplasmic tails of antigenic receptors. Lck is predominantly expressed in T lymphocytes; however, it can be ectopically found in B-1 cell subsets and numerous pathologies including acute and chronic B-cell leukemias. The exact impact of Lck on the B-cell signaling apparatus remains enigmatic and is followed by the long-lasting question of mechanisms granting selectivity among SFK members. In this work we sought to investigate the mechanistic basis of ectopic Lck function in B-cells and compare it to events elicited by the predominant B-cell SFK, Lyn. Our results reveal substrate promiscuity displayed by the two SFKs, which however, is buffered by their differential susceptibility toward regulatory mechanisms, revealing a so far unappreciated aspect of SFK member-specific fine-tuning. Furthermore, we show that Lck- and Lyn-generated signals suffice to induce transcriptome alterations, reminiscent of B-cell activation, in the absence of receptor/co-receptor engagement. Finally, our analyses revealed a yet unrecognized role of SFKs in tipping the balance of cellular stress responses, by promoting the onset of ER-phagy, an as yet completely uncharacterized process in B lymphocytes.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

 abstract = {Redundancy in transfer RNA (tRNA) gene copies across species remains poorly understood and, in many cases, largely unexplored. In Staphylococcus aureus, multiple tRNAGly genes encode isoacceptors involved in protein synthesis and cell wall formation, aminoacylated by a sole glycyl-tRNA synthetase (GlyRS) which is under the transcription regulation of a species-specific glyS T-box riboswitch. The T-box can interact with all tRNAGly isoacceptors to adopt species-specific conformations and affect both pathways. Using CRISPR/Cas9 editing, we ablated a gene copy corresponding to the proteinogenic P1 tRNAGlyGCC. Surprisingly, the growth and the overall translational activity of the edited strain were found unaffected, suggesting functional compensation by the remaining tRNAGly genes. On the other hand, transcriptomics and proteomics analyses combined with functional assays revealed nutrient-dependent stress responses with surprisingly impaired cell wall integrity and increased susceptibility to cell wall-targeting antibiotics. Additionally, the edited strain displayed reduced biofilm formation but retained the ability to invade human cells in vitro. Overall, the present study underscores the critical role of tRNA gene redundancy in the physiology of S. aureus and highlights tRNAs as regulators of metabolic homeostasis in pathogenic bacteria.Staphylococcus aureus has multiple copies of tRNAGly genes involved in either protein production or cell wall formation. Removing one tRNAGly copy, used in translation, via CRISPR/Cas9 didn’t affect growth but weakened the cell wall, making it more susceptible to antibiotics, and reduced biofilm formation. This study reveals how S. aureus can adapt with fewer tRNA genes by sacrificing its ability to infect and resist to antibiotics.},

 abstract = {In nature plants constantly experience changes in light intensities. Low illumination limits photosynthesis and growth. However, also high light intensities are a threat to plants as the photosynthetic machinery gets damaged when the incoming energy surpasses the capacity of photochemistry. One limitation of photochemistry is the constant resupply of stromal electron (e-) acceptors, mainly NADP. NADP is reduced at the acceptor-side of photosystem I. The resulting NADPH is utilized by the Calvin–Benson–Bassham cycle (CBBC) and the malate valve to ensure sufficient oxidized NADP ready to accept e- from PSI. Lately, additional pathways, which function as stromal e- sinks under abiotic stress conditions, were discovered. One such reaction in Arabidopsis thaliana is catalyzed by PHOSPHOGLYCERATE DEHYDROGENASE 3 (PGDH3), which diverts e- from the CBBC into NADH. pgdh3 loss-of-function mutants exhibit elevated non-photochemical quenching (NPQ) and fluctuating light susceptibility. To optimize plant photosynthesis in challenging environments knowledge on PGDH3’s metabolic integration is needed. We used the source of high NPQ in pgdh3 as a starting point. Our study reveals that increased NPQ originates from high cyclic electron flow (CEF). Interestingly, PGDH3 function seems very important when the CEF-generator PROTON GRADIENT REGULATION5 (PGR5) is lost. Consequently, pgr5pgdh3 double mutants are more sensitive to fluctuating light.},

@article{kruk_integrated_2024,
 abstract = {Airway microbiota are known to contribute to lung diseases, such as cystic fibrosis (CF), but their contributions to pathogenesis are still unclear. To improve our understanding of host-microbe interactions, we have developed an integrated analytical and bioinformatic mass spectrometry (MS)-based metaproteomics workflow to analyze clinical bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) samples from people with airway disease. Proteins from BAL cellular pellets were processed and pooled together in groups categorized by disease status (CF vs. non-CF) and bacterial diversity, based on previously performed small subunit rRNA sequencing data. Proteins from each pooled sample group were digested and subjected to liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry (MS/MS). MS/MS spectra were matched to human and bacterial peptide sequences leveraging a bioinformatic workflow using a metagenomics-guided protein sequence database and rigorous evaluation. Label-free quantification revealed differentially abundant human peptides from proteins with known roles in CF, like neutrophil elastase and collagenase, and proteins with lesser-known roles in CF, including apolipoproteins. Differentially abundant bacterial peptides were identified from known CF pathogens (e.g., \textit{Pseudomonas}), as well as other taxa with potentially novel roles in CF. We used this host-microbe peptide panel for targeted parallel-reaction monitoring validation, demonstrating for the first time an MS-based assay effective for quantifying host-microbe protein dynamics within BAL cells from individual CF patients. Our integrated bioinformatic and analytical workflow combining discovery, verification, and validation should prove useful for diverse studies to characterize microbial contributors in airway diseases. Furthermore, we describe a promising preliminary panel of differentially abundant microbe and host peptide sequences for further study as potential markers of host-microbe relationships in CF disease pathogenesis.IMPORTANCEIdentifying microbial pathogenic contributors and dysregulated human responses in airway disease, such as CF, is critical to understanding disease progression and developing more effective treatments. To this end, characterizing the proteins expressed from bacterial microbes and human host cells during disease progression can provide valuable new insights. We describe here a new method to confidently detect and monitor abundance changes of both microbe and host proteins from challenging BAL samples commonly collected from CF patients. Our method uses both state-of-the art mass spectrometry-based instrumentation to detect proteins present in these samples and customized bioinformatic software tools to analyze the data and characterize detected proteins and their association with CF. We demonstrate the use of this method to characterize microbe and host proteins from individual BAL samples, paving the way for a new approach to understand molecular contributors to CF and other diseases of the airway.},

 abstract = {Neurological diseases can lead to the denervation of brain regions caused by demyelination, traumatic injury or cell death. The molecular and structural mechanisms underlying lesion-induced reorganization of denervated brain regions, however, are a matter of ongoing investigation. In order to address this issue, we performed an entorhinal cortex lesion (ECL) in mouse organotypic entorhino-hippocampal tissue cultures of both sexes and studied denervation-induced plasticity of mossy fiber synapses, which connect dentate granule cells (dGCs) with CA3 pyramidal cells (CA3-PCs) and play important roles in learning and memory formation. Partial denervation caused a strengthening of excitatory neurotransmission in dGCs, CA3-PCs and their direct synaptic connections, as revealed by paired recordings (dGC-to-CA3-PC). These functional changes were accompanied by ultrastructural reorganization of mossy fiber synapses, which regularly contain the plasticity-regulating protein synaptopodin and the spine apparatus organelle. We demonstrate that the spine apparatus organelle and synaptopodin are related to ribosomes in close proximity to synaptic sites and reveal a synaptopodin-related transcriptome. Notably, synaptopodin-deficient tissue preparations that lack the spine apparatus organelle failed to express lesion-induced synaptic adjustments. Hence, synaptopodin and the spine apparatus organelle play a crucial role in regulating lesion-induced synaptic plasticity at hippocampal mossy fiber synapses.},

 abstract = {The treatment of elderly, nonfit acute myeloid leukemia (AML)/MDS patients with relapsed/refractory (R/R) disease remains challenging. As histone demethylase LSD1 (KDM1A) is a rational therapeutic target in AML, we conducted a phase I trial (“rolling-six design”) with the LSD1 inhibitor tranylcypromine (TCP, dose levels [DL] 20, 40, 60, 80 mg p.o. d1-28) combined with fixed-dose ATRA (45 mg/m2 p.o. d10-28) and low-dose cytarabine (LDAC, 40 mg s.c. d1-10). The primary endpoint was dose-limiting toxicity (DLT) in the first 28 days of treatment. The aim was the determination of the maximum tolerated TCP dose (MTD). Twenty-three patients with AML and 2 with MDS were accrued. TCP was administered for a median of 39.5 days (range: 11–228). No DLTs were observed at any DL; MTD could not be established. No differentiation syndrome occurred. Two patients attained a PR; SD was achieved in 10 of 22 evaluable patients. Median OS was 62 days (range: 14–325). Accompanying studies included pharmacokinetics, serial determinations of fetal hemoglobin (HbF), detection of CD38 upregulation with treatment, as well as transcriptome changes in purified blood blasts over time. In conclusion, the combination of TCP with ATRA and LDAC was well feasible, even at the highest DL. Hence, studies with more potent LSD1 inhibitors appear warranted.

 abstract = {BACKGROUND: Artificial intelligence (AI) programs that train on large datasets require powerful compute infrastructure consisting of several CPU cores and GPUs. JupyterLab provides an excellent framework for developing AI programs, but it needs to be hosted on such an infrastructure to enable faster training of AI programs using parallel computing.
FINDINGS: An open-source, docker-based, and GPU-enabled JupyterLab infrastructure is developed that runs on the public compute infrastructure of Galaxy Europe consisting of thousands of CPU cores, many GPUs, and several petabytes of storage to rapidly prototype and develop end-to-end AI projects. Using a JupyterLab notebook, long-running AI model training programs can also be executed remotely to create trained models, represented in open neural network exchange (ONNX) format, and other output datasets in Galaxy. Other features include Git integration for version control, the option of creating and executing pipelines of notebooks, and multiple dashboards and packages for monitoring compute resources and visualization, respectively.
CONCLUSIONS: These features make JupyterLab in Galaxy Europe highly suitable for creating and managing AI projects. A recent scientific publication that predicts infected regions in COVID-19 computed tomography scan images is reproduced using various features of JupyterLab on Galaxy Europe. In addition, ColabFold, a faster implementation of AlphaFold2, is accessed in JupyterLab to predict the 3-dimensional structure of protein sequences. JupyterLab is accessible in 2 ways-one as an interactive Galaxy tool and the other by running the underlying Docker container. In both ways, long-running training can be executed on Galaxy's compute infrastructure. Scripts to create the Docker container are available under MIT license at https://github.com/usegalaxy-eu/gpu-jupyterlab-docker.},

In this study, we have explored the available human gut microbiome 16S rRNA sequence datasets of cohorts representing large geographical gradients. The 16S rRNA sequences representing V3-V4 as well as V4 regions generated using Illumina sequencing chemistry in the MiSeq platform encompassing the United States of America, Chile, South Africa, Kuwait, and Malaysia were subjected to in-depth computational biology analyses. Firmicutes and Bacteroidetes were the most dominant phyla present in all studied cohorts but Actinobacteria was exclusively present in high abundance in cohorts from Malaysia (15.99\%). The relative abundance of five families, namely Bacteroidaceae, Ruminococcaceae, Prevotellaceae, Clostridiaceae, and Eubacteriaceae were highest representing the studied cohorts. The permutational multivariate analysis of variance (PERMANOVA) showed that the dissimilarity in the gut microbiome structure of cohorts representing studied countries was significant (R2 = 0.28, P {\textless} 0.001). The calculated Firmicutes to Bacteroidetes (F : B) ratio was found to be lowest in cohorts from South Africa (1.11) and Chile (0.95). The cohorts from South Africa exhibited the highest alpha diversity based on Hill numbers at q=0, whereas at q=1 and 2, cohorts from Malaysia had the highest alpha diversity. The beta diversity analysis revealed that cohorts from Chile formed a distinct cluster among all the studied geographical locations. For the first time, the study also showed that cohorts from Malaysia representing short geographical distances exhibited distinct intrapopulation differences in the gut microbiome and may not be influenced by cultural and genetic factors.},

 abstract = {Polycomb repressive complex (PRC) group proteins regulate various developmental processes in plants by repressing target genes via H3K27 trimethylation, and they function antagonistically with H3K4 trimethylation mediated by Trithorax group proteins. Tuberization in potato has been widely studied, but the role of histone modifications in this process is unknown. Recently, we showed that overexpression of StMSI1, a PRC2 member, alters the expression of tuberization genes in potato. As MSI1 lacks histone-modification activity, we hypothesized that this altered expression could be caused by another PRC2 member, StE(z)2, a potential H3K27 methyltransferase in potato. Here, we demonstrate that a short-day photoperiod influences StE(z)2 expression in the leaves and stolons. StE(z)2 overexpression alters plant architecture and reduces tuber yield, whereas its knockdown enhances yield. ChIP-sequencing using stolons induced by short-days indicated that several genes related to tuberization and phytohormones, such as StBEL5/11/29, StSWEET11B, StGA2OX1, and StPIN1 carry H3K4me3 or H3K27me3 marks and/or are StE(z)2 targets. Interestingly, we observed that another important tuberization gene, StSP6A, is targeted by StE(z)2 in leaves and that it has increased deposition of H3K27me3 under long-day (non-induced) conditions compared to short days. Overall, our results show that StE(z)2 and deposition of H3K27me3 and/or H3K4me3 marks might regulate the expression of key tuberization genes in potato.},

These results reveal potential post-transcriptional regulation, providing researchers with important new insights into underlying biological and pathological disease mechanisms.

 abstract = {In the present study, we report the draft genome of soil isolate DP-K7 that has the potential to degrade methyl red. The 16S rRNA gene sequencing and whole-genome analysis exposed that the bacterial strain DP-K7 belongs to the species Kocuria indica. The genome annotation of the strain DP-K7 through the bioinformatics tool “Prokka” showed that the genome contains 3,010,594 bp with 69.01\% GC content. The genome comprises 57 contigs including 2 rRNA genes, 47 tRNA genes, and 2754 CDS. The plate and broth assay showed that the strain DP-K7 has the potential to utilize methyl red as the sole carbon source for growth. Indeed, the RP-HPLC analysis proved that the strain DP-K7 is capable of degrading methyl red. The genome BLAST against a characterized azoreductase (AzoB—Xenophilus azovorans KF46F) revealed the presence of two azoreductase-like genes (azoKi-1 and azoKi-2). The phylogenetic analysis of the primary amino acid sequence of characterized azoreductases suggested that AzoKi-1 and AzoKi-2 belong to members of the clade IV azoreductase, which are flavin-independent. The multiple sequence alignment of AzoKi-1 and AzoKi-2 with flavin-independent azoreductases showed the presence of NAD(P)H binding like motif (GxxGxxG). In addition, other genes coding for dye degrading enzymes (SodC, SodA, KatA, KatE, and DyP2) were also found in the genome supporting that the strain K. indica DP-K7 is a potential azo dye degrader.},

 abstract = {Antimicrobial resistance is a major global health crisis, resulting in thousands of deaths each year. Antibiotics' effectiveness against microorganisms deteriorates over time as multidrug resistance (MDR) develops, which is exacerbated by irregular antibiotic use, poor disease management, and the evasive nature of bacteria. The World Health Organization has recognized multidrug resistance as a critical public health concern, and \textit{Acinetobacter baumannii} has been at the center of attention due to its ability to develop multidrug resistance (MDR). It generally produces carbapenem-hydrolyzing oxacillinase, which has been identified as the primary source of beta-lactam resistance in MDR bacteria. Recently, point mutations in \textit{A. baumannii} have been identified as a key factor of multidrug resistance, making them a prime concern for researchers. The goal of the current work was to establish a unique way of finding multidrug-resistant variants and identify the most damaging mutations in the existing databases. We characterized the deleterious variants of oxacillinases using several computational tools. Following a thorough analysis, Oxa-376 and Oxa-530 were found to be more damaging when compared with the wild-type Oxa-51. The mutants' 3D structures were then prepared and refined with RaptorX, GalaxyRefine, and SAVES servers. Our research incorporates seven antimicrobial agents to illustrate the resistance capability of the variants of oxacillinase by evaluating binding affinity in Autodock-vina and Schrodinger software. RMSD, RMSF, Radius of gyration analysis, the solvent-accessible surface area (SASA), hydrogen bonding analysis and MM-GBSA from Molecular Dynamics Simulation revealed the dynamic nature and stability of wild-type and Oxa-376 and Oxa-530 variants. Our findings will benefit researchers looking for the deleterious mutations of \textit{Acinetobacter baumannii} and new therapeutics to combat those variants. However, further studies are necessary to evaluate the mechanism of hydrolyzing activity and antibiotic resistance of these variants.},

 abstract = {Antimicrobial resistance (AMR) is a major global challenge that disproportionately affects low- and middle-income countries (LMICs). Environmental contamination by resistant bacteria from animal production facilities is a major driver of the spread of AMR through the food chain, requiring a robust one-health control approach. Traditional culture-based AMR surveillance is time-consuming and less sensitive, and fails to fully capture the spectrum of AMR, evolutionary trends, and epidemiological patterns of AMR spread. Whole-genome sequencing (WGS) has revolutionized AMR surveillance capabilities. Rapid WGS captures the full AMR spectrum with minimum samples, aids source attribution, and provides insights into trends in AMR spread. The portable Oxford Nanopore® Technology (ONT) platform, coupled with open-source software such as Galaxy and Konstanz Information Miner (KNIME), enables the establishment of a potentially portable, transferable workflow for low-resource settings. This study aimed to assess the AMR burden on four dairy farms in Kandy, Sri Lanka, via a resource-limited LMIC using a low-cost high-throughput screening assay and rapid WGS via ONT with Galaxy and KNIME processing to obtain full antibiotic resistomes.},

 abstract = {Knowledge of variability in phenological traits is of utmost importance in breeding new almond cultivars in the context of impending climate change. The Northwestern Himalayan region is characterized by extreme winters, and phenological studies of fruit crops in relation to environmental variables in this region are scant. Flowering time being an important trait governing agricultural productivity, the objectives of this study were the evaluation of local and exotic almond cultivars for blooming initiation and other associated parameters. This study also aimed at deciphering the association between bloom dates in almonds and prevailing temperatures. Field phenological observations were performed during seven growing seasons (2012–2018) in Kashmir. Phenological traits like endodormancy breaking were estimated using the correlation model. The heat requirements for blooming were estimated using the growing degree days (GDD) method. The association between average temperatures and days to flowering was studied using partial least squares (PLS) regression. Local cultivars ‘Makhdoom’ and ‘Shalimar’ were earliest to bloom within 80 days, while the exotic cultivars were late bloomers, requiring 87 days. Cultivars ‘Makhdoom’, ‘Shalimar’, ‘Drake’ and ‘Pranyaj’ broke their endodormancy on the same date, i.e. December 26, although another group including ‘Waris’, ‘California Paper Shell’ and ‘Merced’ exhibited endo- to ecodormancy transition on January 21. In general, Himalayan-origin almond cultivars revealed low heat requirements for flowering compared to the exotic ones. PLS regression analysis identified four major periods in which average temperatures successfully explained variation in days to blooming in almonds. In conclusion, a phenological prediction model is presented here that explains variation in blooming dates in almond cultivars as a function of average temperatures. This model addresses the almond cultivars growing in the Himalayan region and is expected to be of great practical utility to the farming community to efficiently plan their orchard management practices.},

@article{kunz_avirulence_2025,
 abstract = {Wheat production is threatened by multiple fungal pathogens, such as the wheat powdery mildew fungus (Blumeria graminis f. sp. tritici, Bgt). Wheat resistance breeding frequently relies on the use of resistance (R) genes that encode diverse immune receptors which detect specific avirulence (AVR) effectors and subsequently induce an immune response. While R gene cloning has accelerated recently, AVR identification in many pathogens including Bgt lags behind, preventing pathogen-informed deployment of resistance sources. Here we describe a new “avirulence depletion (AD) assay” for rapid identification of AVR genes in Bgt. This assay relies on the selection of a segregating, haploid F1 progeny population on a resistant host, followed by bulk sequencing, thereby allowing rapid avirulence candidate gene identification with high mapping resolution. In a proof-of-concept experiment we mapped the AVR component of the wheat immune receptor Pm3a to a 25 kb genomic interval in Bgt harboring a single effector, the previously described AvrPm3a2/f2. Subsequently, we applied the AD assay to map the unknown AVR effector recognized by the Pm60 immune receptor. We show that AvrPm60 is encoded by three tandemly arrayed, nearly identical effector genes that trigger an immune response upon co-expression with Pm60 and its alleles Pm60a and Pm60b. We furthermore provide evidence that Pm60 outperforms Pm60a and Pm60b through more efficient recognition of AvrPm60 effectors, suggesting it should be prioritized for wheat breeding. Finally, we show that virulence towards Pm60 is caused by simultaneous deletion of all AvrPm60 gene paralogs and that isolates lacking AvrPm60 are especially prevalent in the US thereby limiting the potential of Pm60 in this region. The AD assay is a powerful new tool for rapid and inexpensive AVR identification in Bgt with the potential to contribute to pathogen-informed breeding decisions for the use of novel R genes and regionally tailored gene deployment.},

@article{kuppannan_novel_2022,
 abstract = {In the ciliate Tetrahymena thermophila, lysosome-related organelles called mucocysts accumulate at the cell periphery where they secrete their contents in response to extracellular events, a phenomenon called regulated exocytosis. The molecular bases underlying regulated exocytosis have been extensively described in animals but it is not clear whether similar mechanisms exist in ciliates or their sister lineage, the Apicomplexan parasites, which together belong to the ecologically and medically important superphylum Alveolata. Beginning with a T. thermophila mutant in mucocyst exocytosis, we used a forward genetic approach to uncover MDL1 (Mucocyst Discharge with a LamG domain), a novel gene that is essential for regulated exocytosis of mucocysts. Mdl1p is a 40 kDa membrane glycoprotein that localizes to mucocysts, and specifically to a tip domain that contacts the plasma membrane when the mucocyst is docked. This sub-localization of Mdl1p, which occurs prior to docking, underscores a functional asymmetry in mucocysts that is strikingly similar to that of highly polarized secretory organelles in other Alveolates. A mis-sense mutation in the LamG domain results in mucocysts that dock but only undergo inefficient exocytosis. In contrast, complete knockout of MDL1 largely prevents mucocyst docking itself. Mdl1p is physically associated with 9 other proteins, all of them novel and largely restricted to Alveolates, and sedimentation analysis supports the idea that they form a large complex. Analysis of three other members of this putative complex, called MDD (for Mucocyst Docking and Discharge), shows that they also localize to mucocysts. Negative staining of purified MDD complexes revealed distinct particles with a central channel. Our results uncover a novel macromolecular complex whose subunits are conserved within alveolates but not in other lineages, that is essential for regulated exocytosis in T. thermophila.},

Seasonal influenza causes 4-50 million symptomatic cases in the EU/EEA each year, with a global death toll reaching 650,000 deaths. That being the case, in 2014 North Macedonia introduced the sentinel surveillance in addition to the existing influenza surveillance in order to obtain more precise data on the burden of disease, circulating viruses and to implement timely preventive measures. The aims of this study were to give a comprehensive virological and epidemiological overview of four influenza seasons (2016-2020), assess the frequency and distribution of influenza circulating in North Macedonia and to carry out molecular and phylogenetic analyses of the hemagglutinin (HA) and neuraminidase (NA) genes of influenza A(H1N1)pdm09, A(H3N2) from ILI and SARI patients. Our results showed that out of 1,632 tested samples, 46.4\% were influenza positive, with influenza A(H1N1)pdm09 accounting for the majority of cases (44\%), followed by influenza B (32\%) and A(H3N2) (17\%). By comparing the sentinel surveillance system to the routine surveillance system, we showed that the newly applied system works efficiently and gives great results in the selection of cases. Statistically significant differences (\textit{p} = {\textless} 0.0000001) were observed when comparing the number of reported ILI cases among patients aged 0-4, 5-14, 15-29, and 30-64 years to the reference age group. The phylogenetic analysis of the HA sequences unveiled the resemblance of mutations circulating seasonally worldwide, with a vast majority of circulating viruses belonging to subclade 6B.1A. The PROVEAN analysis showed that the D187A substitution in the receptor binding site (RBS) of the A(H1N1)pdm09 HA has a deleterious effect on the its function. The A(H3N2) viruses fell into the 3C.2a and 3C.3a throughout the analyzed seasons. Molecular characterization revealed that various substitutions in the A(H3N2) viruses gradually replaced the parental variant in subsequent seasons before becoming the dominant variant. With the introduction of sentinel surveillance, accompanied by the advances made in whole-genome sequencing and vaccine therapeutics, public health officials can now modify their approach in disease management and intervene effectively and in a timely manner to prevent major morbidity and mortality from influenza.},

 abstract = {The limited cytosolic delivery of DNA and protein-based therapeutics due to endosomal entrapment reduces drug efficacy, increasing treatment costs and possible side effects in human and veterinary medicine as a consequence of higher administered dosages. Plant-derived triterpenoid saponins, specifically those with endosomal escape-enhancing (EEE) properties, have shown promise in overcoming this limitation by disrupting endosomal membranes. QS-21, a well-known EEE saponin, has been used as an adjuvant in vaccines, and recent studies have elucidated its biosynthetic pathway. However, EEE saponins are typically present as minor compounds in plants, posing challenges for their large-scale production and purification. Here we investigated the possibility of engineering SO1861 production, an EEE saponin from Saponaria officinalis, using heterologous gene expression in Gypsophila elegans hairy roots, a plant species known to synthesize structurally related saponins. Via S. officinalis transcriptomics, we identified jasmonate-responsive saponin biosynthetic genes, and three cytochrome P450s (CYP450s) involved in C23, C28 and C16 oxidations were characterised. Heterologous expression of these CYP450s in G. elegans hairy roots successfully altered the saponin profile, with notable increases in SO1861 precursors in lines expressing the C23-oxidases SoCYP72A984 and SoCYP72A1003. Interestingly, expression of only SoCYP72A1003, a non-canonical C23 oxidase, resulted in the accumulation of a compound matching the SO1861 standard, suggesting the activation of a potentially latent pathway and of silent enzymes in a novel combination. This work underscores the potential of engineering strategies in heterologous plant systems to steer triterpenoid saponin biosynthetic pathways and suggests new avenues for producing high-value EEE saponins.},

 abstract = {Survival of brachyuran crabs is temperature-dependent and thermal stress promotes changes during molting. We aimed to decipher the impact of thermal stresses on the X-organ/sinus gland (XO/SG) complex, a temperature-sensitive neuroendocrine tissue involved in the molting regulation of Callinectes sapidus during the intermolt and premolt phases. We employed a proteogenomic approach using specimens subjected to control (24 °C), cold (19 °C), and heat (29 °C) temperatures. A total of 1463 protein groups with at least two unique peptides were identified and quantified. C. sapidus in the premolt stage exposed to the cold condition exhibited a proteome closely resembling that of the intermolt stage, as evidenced by measurements of circulating ecdysteroid levels. Compared to the intermolt at control temperature, the premolt stage exhibited increased energy metabolism, structural changes in the cuticle mediated by chitin metabolism and glycoproteins, biosynthesis of methyl farnesoate (MF), and elevated tissue levels of molt-inhibiting hormone (MIH) and crustacean hyperglycemic hormone (CHH), indicating lower secretion rates. Heat temperature (29 °C) seems to induce mitochondrial metabolism in the intermolt XO/SG, while cold temperature elicited a delayed molt cycle in the premolt phase, marked by reduced tissue levels of CHH, indicating increased secretion and Y-organ (YO) inhibition, and decreased MF production (reduced YO stimulation).
Significance statement
Temperature plays a pivotal role in regulating the metabolism, growth, molting, reproduction, and survival of crabs, such as the blue crab (Callinectes sapidus). Despite the blue crab's significance on both economic and ecological realms, there has been a notable lack of molecular information related to this species and therefore a gap in our knowledge of the blue crab's molecular makeup and genetic diversity. This research established a comprehensive proteome landscape to elucidate the molecular and functional changes in the XO/SG complex involved in the molting process of C. sapidus, and how thermal stresses significantly influence biotransformation processes. Utilizing a proteogenomics approach with multi-round homologous database analysis, we have generated a highly accurate protein repertoire with at least two unique peptide of XO/SG tissue proteome. This resource will be invaluable for future molecular analyses of this species. Our findings demonstrate that thermal stresses induced specific modifications in the XO/SG tissue, depending on the molt cycle phase. Temperature-mediated responses influences the biological processes, enhancing the functional morphogenesis and comprehensive metabolic adaptations on molting cycle supported by a relationship between the XO/SG tissue proteome and circulating ecdysteroid levels.},

 abstract = {Cyclic nucleotide-gated (CNG) cation channels are important heterotetrameric proteins in the retina, with different subunit composition in cone and rod photoreceptor cells: three CNGA3 and one CNGB3 in cones and three CNGA1 and one CNGB1 in rods. CNGA and CNGB subunits form separate subfamilies. We have analyzed the evolution of the CNG gene family in metazoans, with special focus on vertebrates by using sequence-based phylogeny and conservation of chromosomal synteny to deduce paralogons resulting from the early vertebrate whole genome duplications (WGDs). Our analyses show, unexpectedly, that the CNGA subfamily had four sister subfamilies in the ancestor of bilaterians and cnidarians that we named CNGC, CNGD, CNGE and CNGF. Of these, CNGC, CNGE and CNGF were lost in the ancestor of Olfactores while CNGD was lost in the vertebrate ancestor. The remaining CNGA and CNGB genes were expanded by a local duplication of CNGA and the subsequent chromosome duplications in the basal vertebrate WGD events. Upon some losses, this resulted in the gnathostome ancestor having three members in the visual CNGA subfamily (CNGA1-3), a single CNGA4 gene, and two members in the CNGB subfamily (CNGB1 and CNGB3). The nature of chromosomal rearrangements in the vertebrate CNGA paralogon was resolved by including the genomes of a non-teleost actinopterygian and an elasmobranch. After the teleost-specific WGD, additional duplicates were generated and retained for CNGA1, CNGA2, CNGA3 and CNGB1. Furthermore, teleosts retain a local duplicate of CNGB3. The retention of duplicated CNG genes is explained by their subfunctionalisation and photoreceptor-specific expression. In conclusion, this study provides evidence for four previously unknown CNG subfamilies in metazoans and further evidence that the early vertebrate WGD events were instrumental in the evolution of the vertebrate visual and central nervous systems.},

We sought to identify genetic risk factors associated with CHD and to accomplish a functional analysis of SNP-carrying genes. We performed a genome-wide association study (GWAS) of 4034 White patients with CHD and 8486 healthy controls. One SNP on chromosome 5q22.2 reached genome-wide significance across all CHD phenotypes and was also indicative for septal defects. One region on chromosome 20p12.1 pointing to the MACROD2 locus identified 4 highly significant SNPs in patients with transposition of the great arteries (TGA). Three highly significant risk variants on chromosome 17q21.32 within the GOSR2 locus were detected in patients with anomalies of thoracic arteries and veins (ATAV). Genetic variants associated with ATAV are suggested to influence the expression of WNT3, and the variant rs870142 related to septal defects is proposed to influence the expression of MSX1. We analyzed the expression of all 4 genes during cardiac differentiation of human and murine induced pluripotent stem cells in vitro and by single-cell RNA-Seq analyses of developing murine and human hearts. Our data show that MACROD2, GOSR2, WNT3, and MSX1 play an essential functional role in heart development at the embryonic and newborn stages.},

One region on chromosome 20 pointing to the \textit{MACROD2} locus, identified four SNPs (rs150246290,OR:3.78, \textit{p}=1.27×10$^{\textrm{−10}}$; rs149890280,OR:3.74, \textit{p}=1.8×10$^{\textrm{−10}}$; rs149467721,OR:3.53; \textit{p}=1.39×10$^{\textrm{−9}}$, rs77094733,OR:3.53, \textit{p}=1.73×10$^{\textrm{−9}}$) in patients with transposition of the great arteries (TGA). A second region was detected on chromosome 8 located at \textit{ZBTB10} (rs148563140,OR:3.42, \textit{p}=3.28×10$^{\textrm{−8}}$; rs143638934,OR:3.42, \textit{p}=3.51×10$^{\textrm{−8}}$) in the same subgroup.

The aim of this study was to characterize the microenvironment of epiretinal PVR tissue, in order to shed more light on the complex pathophysiology and to unravel new treatment options.{\textless}h4{\textgreater}Methods{\textless}/h4{\textgreater}A total of 44 tissue samples were analyzed in this study, including 19 epiretinal PVRs, 13 epiretinal membranes (ERMs) from patients with macular pucker, as well as 12 internal limiting membranes (ILMs). The cellular and molecular microenvironment was assessed by cell type deconvolution analysis (xCell), RNA sequencing data and single-cell imaging mass cytometry. Candidate drugs for PVR treatment were identified in silico via a transcriptome-based drug-repurposing approach.{\textless}h4{\textgreater}Results{\textless}/h4{\textgreater}RNA sequencing of tissue samples demonstrated distinct transcriptional profiles of PVR, ERM, and ILM samples. Differential gene expression analysis revealed 3194 upregulated genes in PVR compared with ILM, including FN1 and SPARC, which contribute to biological processes, such as extracellular matrix (ECM) organization. The xCell and IMC analyses showed that PVR membranes were composed of macrophages, retinal pigment epithelium, and α-SMA-positive myofibroblasts, the latter predominantly characterized by the co-expression of immune cell signature markers. Finally, 13 drugs were identified as potential therapeutics for PVR, including aminocaproic acid and various topoisomerase-2A inhibitors.{\textless}h4{\textgreater}Conclusions{\textless}/h4{\textgreater}Epiretinal PVR membranes exhibit a unique and complex transcriptional and cellular profile dominated by immune cells and myofibroblasts, as well as a variety of ECM components.

 abstract = {Fentanyl is one of the most common opioid analgesics administered to patients undergoing surgery or for chronic pain management. While the side effects of chronic fentanyl abuse are recognized (e.g., addiction, tolerance, impairment of cognitive functions, and inhibit nociception, arousal, and respiration), it remains poorly understood what and how changes in brain activity from chronic fentanyl use influences the respective behavioral outcome. Here, we examined the functional and molecular changes to cortical neural network activity following sub-chronic exposure to two fentanyl concentrations, a low (0.01 μM) and high (10 μM) dose. Primary rat co-cultures, containing cortical neurons, astrocytes, and oligodendrocyte precursor cells, were seeded in wells on either a 6-well multi-electrode array (MEA, for electrophysiology) or a 96-well tissue culture plate (for serial endpoint bulk RNA sequencing analysis). Once networks matured (at 28 days \textit{in vitro}), co-cultures were treated with 0.01 or 10 μM of fentanyl for 4 days and monitored daily. Only high dose exposure to fentanyl resulted in a decline in features of spiking and bursting activity as early as 30 min post-exposure and sustained for 4 days in cultures. Transcriptomic analysis of the complex cultures after 4 days of fentanyl exposure revealed that both the low and high dose induced gene expression changes involved in synaptic transmission, inflammation, and organization of the extracellular matrix. Collectively, the findings of this \textit{in vitro} study suggest that while neuroadaptive changes to neural network activity at a systems level was detected only at the high dose of fentanyl, transcriptomic changes were also detected at the low dose conditions, suggesting that fentanyl rapidly elicits changes in plasticity.},

 abstract = {The sRNA Yfr1 and members of the Yfr2 sRNA family are almost universally present within cyanobacteria. The conserved motifs of these sRNAs are nearly complementary to each other, suggesting their ability to participate in crosstalk. The conserved motif of Yfr1 is shared by members of the Yfr10 sRNA family, members of which are otherwise less conserved in sequence, structure, and synteny compared to Yfr1. The different structural properties enable the discrimination of unique targets of Yfr1 and Yfr10. Unlike most studied regulatory sRNAs, Yfr1 gene expression only slightly changes under the tested stress conditions and is present at high levels at all times. In contrast, cellular levels of Yfr10 increase during the course of acclimation to darkness, and levels of Yfr2 increase when cells are shifted to high light or nitrogen limitation conditions. In this study, we investigated the targetomes of Yfr2, Yfr1, and Yfr10 in Prochlorococcus MED4, establishing CRAFD-Seq as a new method for identifying direct targets of these sRNAs that is applicable to all bacteria, including those that are not amenable to genetic modification. The results suggest that these sRNAs are integrated within a regulatory network of unprecedented complexity in the adjustment of carbon and nitrogen-related primary metabolism.},

The cats were part of a study on feline hepatotropic viruses (collection A, 43 animals). On metaviromic investigation, parvoviral reads were identified in the sera of the two cats. The feline parvovirus genome was 5.3 kb long with an organization similar to other members of the Erythroparvovirus genus. In the ORF1 (nonstructural proteins) and ORF2 (VP1/VP2 precursor) the feline virus displayed 43.1\% and 49.1\% nucleotide identity to human parvovirus B19, and 48.9\% and 56.6\% to chipmunk parvovirus. Sequence identity to canine/feline protoparvovirus (Protoparvovirus carnivoran 1) was as low as 36.5\% \% and 29.2\% in the ORF1 and ORF2, respectively. Using a quantitative PCR assay, the virus was also identified in an additional ten cats (prevalence 27.6\%, 12/43) from collection A and in 15/1150 (1.3\%) of archival sera (collection B), revealing a higher infection rate in cats with altered hepatic markers, suggestive of hepatic distress.

Convalescent plasma treatment of immunocompromised individuals could be an option especially in countries with limited access to monoclonal antibody therapies. While studies in immunocompetent COVID19 patients have demonstrated only a limited benefit, evidence for the safety, timing, and effectiveness of this treatment in antibody-deficient patients is lacking. Here, we describe 16 cases with primary antibody deficiency treated with convalescent plasma in four medical centers. In our cohort, treatment was associated with a reduction in viral load and improvement of clinical symptoms, even when applied over a week after onset of infection. There were no relevant side effects besides a short-term fever reaction in one patient. Longitudinal full-genome sequencing revealed the emergence of mutations in the viral genome, potentially conferring an antibody escape in one patient with persistent viral RNA shedding upon plasma treatment. However, he resolved the infection after a second course of plasma treatment. Thus, our data suggest a therapeutic benefit of convalescent plasma treatment in patients with primary antibody deficiency even months after infection. While it appears to be safe, PCR follow-up for SARS-CoV-2 is advisable and early re-treatment might be considered in patients with persistent viral shedding.},

 abstract = {SARS-CoV-2 is assumed to use angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) and other auxiliary proteins for cell entry. Recent studies have described conjunctival congestion in 0.8\% of patients with laboratory-confirmed SARS-CoV-2, and there has been speculation that SARS-CoV-2 can be transmitted through the conjunctiva. However, it is currently unclear whether conjunctival epithelial cells express ACE2 and its cofactors. In this study, a total of 38 conjunctival samples from 38 patients, including 12 healthy conjunctiva, 12 melanoma, 7 squamous cell carcinoma and 7 papilloma samples, were analyzed using high-throughput RNA sequencing to assess mRNA expression of the SARS-CoV-2 receptor ACE2 and its cofactors including TMPRSS2, ANPEP, DPP4, and ENPEP. ACE2 protein expression was assessed in eight healthy conjunctival samples using immunohistochemistry. Our results show that the SARS-CoV-2 receptor ACE2 is not substantially expressed in conjunctival samples on the mRNA (median 0.0 transcripts per million (TPM), min 0.0 TPM, max 1.7 TPM) and protein levels. Similar results were obtained for the transcription of other auxiliary molecules. In conclusion, this study finds no evidence for a significant expression of ACE2 and its auxiliary mediators for cell entry in conjunctival samples, making conjunctival infection with SARS-CoV-2 via these mediators unlikely.

In previous research, we demonstrated that whiteflies from the Aleyrodidae family (e.g., Bemisia tabaci), mosquitoes from the Culicinae subfamily (e.g., Aedes aegypti), and flies of Sciaroidea superfamily (e.g., Contarinia nasturtii) acquired these genes via three independent horizontal gene transfer events. The temporal expression profiles analyzed in mosquitoes and flies are consistent with the expected for immune effector molecules of insects. Notably, in A. aegypti, we found that these genes contribute to immunity. In whiteflies, codon analysis suggests that RIP genes have evolved under the influence of natural selection. Public transcriptomic experiments have shown that these genes are expressed in the adult stage of B. tabaci. Despite computational findings supporting RIP genes functionality in whiteflies, no experimental studies have been conducted. Furthermore, there is currently no publicly available RNA-seq data evaluating gene expression throughout ontogeny in the Aleyrodidae family. In this work, we experimentally demonstrated the presence of these foreign genes in the genome of Trialeurodes vaporariorum. We quantified their expression across the life cycle stages of this species and analyzed their untranslated regions. The results obtained contribute to a deeper understanding of the biological roles that these ribotoxin encoding genes may play in whiteflies and other insects.},

Both groups of genes are derived from two independent horizontal gene transfer (HGT) events and are evolving under purifying selection. Here, we report and characterize the occurrence of a third HGT event in the Sciaroidea superfamily, which supports the recurrent acquisition of RIP genes by insects. Transcriptomic experiments, available in databases, allowed us to describe the temporal and spatial expression profiles for these foreign genes in these organisms. Furthermore, we found that RIP expression is induced after infection with pathogens and provided, for the first time, transcriptomic evidence of parasite SRL depurination.

Healthy corneas (n=7) and keratoconus (n=4) samples served as controls. Formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded (FFPE) human corneal specimens were analyzed using the 3' RNA sequencing method Massive Analysis of cDNA Ends (MACE RNA-seq). The cellular host response was investigated using comprehensive bioinformatic deconvolution (xCell and CYBERSORTx) analyses and by integration with published single cell RNA-seq data of the human cornea. RESULTS Our analysis identified 216 and 561 genes, that were specifically overexpressed in viral or bacterial/fungal keratitis, respectively, and allowed to distinguish the two etiologies. The virus-specific host response was driven by adaptive immunity and associated molecular signaling pathways, whereas the bacterial/fungal-specific host response mainly involved innate immunity signaling pathways and cell types. We identified several genes and pathways involved in the host response to infectious keratitis, including CXCL9, CXCR3, and MMP9 for viral, and S100A8/A9, MMP9, and the IL17 pathway for bacterial/fungal keratitis. CONCLUSIONS High-resolution molecular profiling provides new insights into the human corneal host response to viral and bacterial/fungal infection. Pathogen-specific molecular profiles may provide the foundation for novel diagnostic biomarker and therapeutic approaches that target inflammation-induced damage to corneal host cells with the goal to improve the outcome of infectious keratitis.},

 abstract = {Improvements in genome sequencing and assembly are enabling high-quality reference genomes for all species. However, the assembly process is still laborious, computationally and technically demanding, lacks standards for reproducibility, and is not readily scalable. Here we present the latest Vertebrate Genomes Project assembly pipeline and demonstrate that it delivers high-quality reference genomes at scale across a set of vertebrate species arising over the last ∼500 million years. The pipeline is versatile and combines PacBio HiFi long-reads and Hi-C-based haplotype phasing in a new graph-based paradigm. Standardized quality control is performed automatically to troubleshoot assembly issues and assess biological complexities. We make the pipeline freely accessible through Galaxy, accommodating researchers even without local computational resources and enhanced reproducibility by democratizing the training and assembly process. We demonstrate the flexibility and reliability of the pipeline by assembling reference genomes for 51 vertebrate species from major taxonomic groups (fish, amphibians, reptiles, birds, and mammals).},

 abstract = {C-type lectin-like domain containing proteins (CTLDcps) mainly bind carbohydrate-based ligands, but also other ligands. CTLDcps are involved in several biological processes including cell adhesion, cell-cell interactions, and pathogen recognition. Pathogen recognition by myeloid cells, e.g. dendritic cells (DCs), can be facilitated through cell surface expressed CTLDcps. Cell surface expressed CTLDcps have been exploited in vaccine designs for specific targeting of human and mouse DCs using antibodies. In recent years, however, DC targeting using carbohydrate-based vaccines has gained interest due to low production cost, limited immunogenicity, and possibility of multivalent adjustment. In chicken, however, only a few CTLDcps have been identified. Identifying and annotating additional chicken CTLDcps (chCTLDcps) is needed to exploit carbohydrate-mediated DC targeting in chicken. Therefore, we searched the chicken GRCg6a assembly for novel chCTLDcps. We identified 28 chCTLDcps of which 10 had previously been described and also experimentally validated. RNA-seq and RT-qPCR confirmed mRNA expression of the remaining 18 identified chCTLDcps. A group of highly related chCTLDcps, moreover, was shown to be avian-specific and comprise novel members mapped to the proposed chicken natural killer gene complex. Two chCTLDcps, chCLEC17AL-A and chCLEC17AL-B, were found to share a recent common ancestor with CLEC17A. Putative mannose or fucose-binding sequence motifs, EPN and WND, were found in the CTLD of chCLEC17AL-A. Both contained intracellular internalisation and signalling sequence motifs. In conclusion, several chCTLDcps were identified and their expression confirmed. Both chCLEC17AL-A and -B showed promise as potential targets in carbohydrate-based chicken vaccine strategies. Determination of DC-specific expression of chCLEC17AL-A and -B, thus, might prove useful in chicken vaccinology.},

 abstract = {Thyroid cancer is the most common endocrine malignancy and several genetic events have been described to promote the development of thyroid carcinogenesis. Besides the effects of specific mutations on thyroid cancer development, the molecular mechanisms controlling tumorigenesis, tumor behavior, and drug resistance are still largely unknown. Cancer organoids have been proposed as a powerful tool to study aspects related to tumor development and progression and appear promising to test individual responses to therapies. Here, using mESC-derived thyroid organoids, we developed a BrafV637E-inducible model able to recapitulate the features of papillary thyroid cancer in vitro. Overexpression of the murine BrafV637E mutation, equivalent to BrafV600E in humans, rapidly triggers to MAPK activation, cell dedifferentiation, and disruption of follicular organization. BrafV637E-expressing organoids show a transcriptomic signature for p53, focal adhesion, ECM-receptor interactions, EMT, and inflammatory signaling pathways. Finally, PTC-like thyroid organoids were used for drug screening assays. The combination of MAPK and PI3K inhibitors reversed BrafV637E oncogene-promoted cell dedifferentiation while restoring thyroid follicle organization and function in vitro. Our results demonstrate that pluripotent stem cells-derived thyroid cancer organoids can mimic tumor development and features while providing an efficient tool for testing novel targeted therapies.},

 abstract = {Background: Traditional omic analysis relies on p-value and fold change as selection criteria. There is an ongoing debate on their effectiveness in delivering systemic and robust interpretation, due to their dependence on assumptions of conformity with various parametric distributions.Here, we propose a threshold-free selection method based on robust, non-parametric statistics, ensuring independence from the statistical distribution properties and broad applicability. Such methods could adapt to different initial data distributions, contrary to statistical techniques based on fixed thresholds. Methods: Our work extends the Rank Products methodology with a neutral selection method of high information-extraction capacity. We introduce the calculation of the RP distribution\&rsquo;s entropy to isolate the features of interest by their contribution to the distribution\&rsquo;s information content. The aim is a methodology performing threshold-free identification of the differentially expressed features, which are highly informative about the phenomenon under scrutiny. Conclusions: Applying the proposed method on microarray (transcriptomic and DNA methylation) and RNAseq count data of varying sizes and noise presence, we observe robust convergence for the different parameterisations to stable cutoff points. Functional analysis through BioInfoMiner and EnrichR was used to evaluate the information potency of the resulting feature lists. Overall, the derived functional terms provide a systemic description highly compatible with the results of traditional statistical hypothesis testing techniques. The methodology behaves consistently across different data types. The feature lists are compact and information-rich, indicating phenotypic aspects specific to the tissue and biological phenomenon i nvestigated. Selection by information content measures efficiently addresses problems, emerging from arbitrary thresholding, thus facilitating the full automation of the analysis.},

 abstract = {Antimicrobial resistance (AMR) is a growing concern in human and veterinary medicine. Misuse and overuse of antimicrobials in human medicine, veterinary medicine, agriculture, and aquaculture are major drivers of AMR development, with resistant bacteria also being selected in livestock and transmitted through meat. Research on AMR in livestock and animal-derived foods is lacking in Fiji; thus, the associated risks remain unclear. Chicken is widely consumed in Fiji and is predominantly served frozen. This study is aimed at determining the prevalence and resistance profiles of Escherichia coli in frozen chicken meat from Fijian supermarkets. A total of 100 frozen chicken meat samples were purchased from supermarkets and retail outlets in Fiji for this study. E. coli was isolated from 72\% of the samples. The E. coli isolates showed relatively high levels of resistance to ampicillin (36\%), tetracycline (24\%), and streptomycin (17\%). Only one cefotaxime-resistant isolate was obtained, which was identified as an extended-spectrum β-lactamase (ESBL)–producing bacterium. This isolate harbored the ESBL-producing gene blaCTX-M-1 and was classified as ST2522. One colistin-resistant isolate was obtained, and its resistance was attributed to a chromosomal mutation in the pmrB gene. The high level of intestinal bacterial contamination in frozen chicken meat suggests that improved hygiene management is necessary throughout the production and distribution chains. Furthermore, because resistance to antimicrobials is important in both human and veterinary medicine (cefotaxime- and colistin-resistant E. coli), careful monitoring of AMR trends in Fiji is essential. These results suggest that AMR surveillance in meat and livestock is necessary to prevent its spread in Fiji.},

@article{latif_nfatc1_2022,
 abstract = {Objectives Non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) can persist in the stage of simple hepatic steatosis or progress to steatohepatitis (NASH) with an increased risk for cirrhosis and cancer. We examined the mechanisms controlling the progression to severe NASH in order to develop future treatment strategies for this disease.
Design NFATc1 activation and regulation was examined in livers from patients with NAFLD, cultured and primary hepatocytes and in transgenic mice with differential hepatocyte-specific expression of the transcription factor (Alb-cre, NFATc1c.a. and NFATc1Δ/Δ). Animals were fed with high-fat western diet (WD) alone or in combination with tauroursodeoxycholic acid (TUDCA), a candidate drug for NAFLD treatment. NFATc1-dependent ER stress-responses, NLRP3 inflammasome activation and disease progression were assessed both in vitro and in vivo.
Results NFATc1 expression was weak in healthy livers but strongly induced in advanced NAFLD stages, where it correlates with liver enzyme values as well as hepatic inflammation and fibrosis. Moreover, high-fat WD increased NFATc1 expression, nuclear localisation and activation to promote NAFLD progression, whereas hepatocyte-specific depletion of the transcription factor can prevent mice from disease acceleration. Mechanistically, NFATc1 drives liver cell damage and inflammation through ER stress sensing and activation of the PERK-CHOP unfolded protein response (UPR). Finally, NFATc1-induced disease progression towards NASH can be blocked by TUDCA administration.
Conclusion NFATc1 stimulates NAFLD progression through chronic ER stress sensing and subsequent activation of terminal UPR signalling in hepatocytes. Interfering with ER stress-responses, for example, by TUDCA, protects fatty livers from progression towards manifest NASH.},

Here, we performed noncoding RNA profiling of human breast cancer–induced secondary lymphedema. We identified the long intergenic non–protein coding RNA, P53-induced transcript (LINC-PINT), as essential for the lymphedema development. LINC-PINT is the most expressed lncRNA in human lymphatic endothelial cells (LECs) under stress condition. Knocking down LINC-PINT in LECs promotes the expression of inflammation-related genes. Mechanistically, ATAC-seq revealed that LINC-PINT induces the transcription of genes involved in lymphangiogenesis and immune cell adhesion by increasing chromatin accessibility. Notably, LINC-PINT deficiency impairs LEC proliferation, migration, and sprouting. Conditional deletion of Lnc-Pint in mouse lymphatic endothelium (Lnc-Pintlecko) leads to a reduction in dermal lymphatic network density. Lnc-Pintlecko mice exhibit decreased lymphedema, reduced dermal backflow, fibrosis, and inflammation. Our findings unveil a crucial molecular role of LINC-PINT in lymphatic function and hold substantial clinical implications for lncRNA as biomarker of lymphedema.},

 abstract = {Hydrogen sulfide (H2S) is a gaseous signaling molecule that participates in various signaling functions in health and diseases. The tetrameric cystathionine γ-lyase (CSE) contributes to H2S biogenesis and several investigations provide evidence on the pharmacological modulation of CSE as a potential target for the treatment of a multitude of conditions. D-penicillamine (D-pen) has recently been reported to selectively impede CSE-catalyzed H2S production but the molecular bases for such inhibitory effect have not been investigated. In this study, we report that D-pen follows a mixed-inhibition mechanism to inhibit both cystathionine (CST) cleavage and H2S biogenesis by human CSE. To decipher the molecular mechanisms underlying such a mixed inhibition, we performed docking and molecular dynamics (MD) simulations. Interestingly, MD analysis of CST binding reveals a likely active site configuration prior to gem-diamine intermediate formation, particularly H-bond formation between the amino group of the substrate and the O3′ of PLP. Similar analyses realized with both CST and D-pen identified three potent interfacial ligand-binding sites for D-pen and offered a rational for D-pen effect. Thus, inhibitor binding not only induces the creation of an entirely new interacting network at the vicinity of the interface between enzyme subunits, but it also exerts long range effects by propagating to the active site. Overall, our study paves the way for the design of new allosteric interfacial inhibitory compounds that will specifically modulate H2S biogenesis by cystathionine γ-lyase.},

@article{leavitt_acute_2024,
 abstract = {Purpose
Tumor hypoxia is a major cause of treatment resistance, especially to radiation therapy at conventional dose rate (CONV), and we wanted to assess whether hypoxia does alter tumor sensitivity to FLASH.
Methods and Materials
We engrafted several tumor types (glioblastoma [GBM], head and neck cancer, and lung adenocarcinoma) subcutaneously in mice to provide a reliable and rigorous way to modulate oxygen supply via vascular clamping or carbogen breathing. We irradiated tumors using a single 20-Gy fraction at either CONV or FLASH, measured oxygen tension, monitored tumor growth, and sampled tumors for bulk RNAseq and pimonidazole analysis. Next, we inhibited glycolysis with trametinib in GBM tumors to enhance FLASH efficacy.
Results
Using various subcutaneous tumor models, and in contrast to CONV, FLASH retained antitumor efficacy under acute hypoxia. These findings show that in addition to normal tissue sparing, FLASH could overcome hypoxia-mediated tumor resistance. Follow-up molecular analysis using RNAseq profiling uncovered a FLASH-specific profile in human GBM that involved cell-cycle arrest, decreased ribosomal biogenesis, and a switch from oxidative phosphorylation to glycolysis. Glycolysis inhibition by trametinib enhanced FLASH efficacy in both normal and clamped conditions.
Conclusions
These data provide new and specific insights showing the efficacy of FLASH in a radiation-resistant context, proving an additional benefit of FLASH over CONV.},

The Omicron variant, a VOC, has become the dominant variant worldwide since November 2021. In the Republic of Korea (South Korea), the number of confirmed cases increased rapidly after the detection of Omicron VOC on November 24, 2021. In this study, we estimated the underlying epidemiological processes of Omicron VOC in South Korea using time-scaled phylodynamic analysis. Three distinct phylogenetic subgroups (Kor-O1, Kor-O2, and Kor-O3) were detected in South Korea. The Kor-O1 subgroup circulated in the Daegu region, whereas Kor-O2 and Kor-O3 circulated in Incheon and Jeollanam-do, respectively. The viral population size and case number of the Kor-O1 subgroup increased more rapidly than those of the other subgroups, indicating the rapid spread of the virus. The results indicated the multiple introductions of Omicron sub-lineages into South Korea and their subsequent co-circulation. The evolution and transmission of SARS-CoV-2 should be continuously monitored, and control strategies need to be improved to control the multiple variants.},

 abstract = {Ciliates assemble numerous microtubular structures into complex cortical patterns. During ciliate division, the pattern is duplicated by intracellular segmentation that produces a tandem of daughter cells. In Tetrahymena thermophila, the induction and positioning of the division boundary involves two mutually antagonistic factors: posterior CdaA (cyclin E) and anterior CdaI (Hippo kinase). Here, we characterized the related cdaH-1 allele, which confers a pleiotropic patterning phenotype including an absence of the division boundary and an anterior–posterior mispositioning of the new oral apparatus. CdaH is a Fused or Stk36 kinase ortholog that localizes to multiple sites that correlate with the effects of its loss, including the division boundary and the new oral apparatus. CdaH acts downstream of CdaA to induce the division boundary and drives asymmetric cytokinesis at the tip of the posterior daughter. CdaH both maintains the anterior–posterior position of the new oral apparatus and interacts with CdaI to pattern ciliary rows within the oral apparatus. Thus, CdaH acts at multiple scales, from induction and positioning of structures on the cell-wide polarity axis to local organelle-level patterning.},

Hence the usefulness of samples with substandard DNA quality for LRS is unknown. We aim to perform de-novo assembly of Adenovirus sequenced from non-human primate (NHP) faeces using the Oxford Nanopore technologies (ONT), an LRS platform. Guided by initial conventional PCR screening, we performed ONT sequencing on 34 Adenovirus positive DNA samples, without prior selection based on faeces freshness level or DNA quality. Non-parametric correlation analysis showed that ONT sequencing outputs is not significantly associated (p {\textgreater} 0.05) with DNA concentrations, faeces freshness levels and the OD ratios of A260/A280 and A260/A230. This indicated that conventional DNA quality parameters may not be the most critical factors in determining the suitability of samples for ONT sequencing. A total of 61.76 \% (21/34) of the positive-by-PCR-screening samples yielded Adenovirus reads while 38.24 \% (13/34) did not in the PCR-free ONT workflow, although rarefaction analysis showed that sequencing saturation was achieved by all samples. Among the 21 samples with adenovirus reads, ten resulted in at least one Adenovirus contig by the Flye assembler while nine did not and two samples had only a single Adenovirus read. Identity similarity above 90 \% in conventional PCR screening may help in selecting ONT positive samples.},

Here, we characterize the transcriptome and assembly of P granules, RNA granules in the \textit{C. elegans} germ plasm. We find that P granules recruit mRNAs by condensation with the disordered protein MEG-3. MEG-3 traps mRNAs into non-dynamic condensates in vitro and binds to {\textasciitilde}500 mRNAs in vivo in a sequence-independent manner that favors embryonic mRNAs with low ribosome coverage. Translational stress causes additional mRNAs to localize to P granules and translational activation correlates with P granule exit for two mRNAs coding for germ cell fate regulators. Localization to P granules is not required for translational repression but is required to enrich mRNAs in the germ lineage for robust germline development. Our observations reveal similarities between P granules and stress granules and identify intrinsically-disordered proteins as drivers of RNA condensation during P granule assembly.},

@phdthesis{lehmann_immunoregulatory_2023,
 abstract = {The protozoan parasite Trypanosoma cruzi (T. cruzi) is the causative agent of the potentially life-threatening Chagas disease and leads to lifelong infection. During the infection, T. cruzi-specific cytotoxic CD8+ T cells are necessary for long-term reduction of parasite burden and inflammation. However, in humans with Chagas disease, CD8+ T cells progressively lose function, characterised by decreased cytokine production, advanced differentiation, and increased expression of co-inhibitory receptors. Nevertheless, high levels of pro-inflammatory cytokines, such as IFN-γ and TNF-α, are present throughout the infection, which are mainly secreted by T cells and NK cells. One of the key features of T. cruzi is a chronic infection over the whole lifespan of the host. Especially skeletal muscle cells, were shown to be persistently infected in mice models.  
Here, strong evidence is presented that skeletal muscle cells provide a unique niche for T. cruzi by inhibiting clearance of the parasite by CD8+ T cells, thereby allowing the parasite to persist in the body. It could be shown that muscle cells actively shape the immune response. Infected primary human skeletal muscle cells produce immune-recruiting chemokines and cytokines, such as IL-6, IL-8, IL-15 and CCL-19. Furthermore, co-inhibitory receptor ligands, such as PD-L1, PD-L2, galectin-9, HVEM, CD155 and CD122 were expressed by the muscle cells upon stimulation with pro-inflammatory cytokines and infection with T. cruzi. While, the soluble forms of the ligands PD-L1, PD-L2 and galectin-9 are simultaneously found in the supernatant of muscle cell cultures. Proliferation-analysis of CD8+ and CD4+ T cells revealed suppressive capacity of T. cruzi-infected muscle cells in a PD-1 and TIM-3-dependent manner. In line, stimulation of the muscle cells with IFN-γ prior to the co-culture resulted in even higher suppression capacity. High levels of galectin-9 are present in the serum of Chagas patients, indicating a potential systemic inhibition of T cell function. Moreover, the secretion of the IL4-I1 enzyme by muscle cells could be demonstrated. This molecule can upregulate co-inhibitory receptor ligands on T cells, reduce T cell proliferation and induce apoptosis. Thus, IL4-I1 might represent a promising new candidate whose immunoregulatory role during T. cruzi infection needs to be further investigated. In conclusion, multiple mechanisms by which muscle cells can regulate the immune cell response are presented here and indicate that blocking only one of those mechanisms might not be sufficient to augment T cell activity.  
Moreover, it was revealed that muscle cells sense the infection with T. cruzi and induce anti-parasitic mechanisms, like the induction of iNOS. This mechanism is capable of significantly reducing the parasite load in muscle cells. The pro-inflammatory environment plays an ambiguous role in the muscle during T. cruzi infection by inducing anti-parasitic mechanisms, thereby reducing parasite burden and at the same time inducing immune regulatory mechanisms, which down-regulate the T cell response. Together, these mechanisms might be essential to ensure limited tissue damage and parasite persistence. Thus, muscle cells prove to be crucial modulators of immune cells during T. cruzi infection.},

 abstract = {Inflammatory bowel diseases (IBD) are associated with compositional and functional changes of the intestinal microbiota, but specific contributions of individual bacteria to chronic intestinal inflammation remain unclear. Enterococcus faecalis is a resident member of the human intestinal core microbiota that has been linked to the pathogenesis of IBD and induces chronic colitis in susceptible monoassociated IL-10-deficient (IL-10-/-) mice. In this study, we characterized the colitogenic activity of E. faecalis as part of a simplified human microbial consortium based on seven enteric bacterial strains (SIHUMI). RNA sequencing analysis of E. faecalis isolated from monoassociated wild type and IL-10-/- mice identified 408 genes including 14 genes of the ethanolamine utilization (eut) locus that were significantly up-regulated in response to inflammation. Despite considerable up-regulation of eut genes, deletion of ethanolamine utilization (∆eutVW) had no impact on E. faecalis colitogenic activity in monoassociated IL-10-/- mice. However, replacement of the E. faecalis wild type bacteria by a ∆eutVW mutant in SIHUMI-colonized IL-10-/- mice resulted in exacerbated colitis, suggesting protective functions of E. faecalis ethanolamine utilization in complex bacterial communities. To better understand E. faecalis gene response in the presence of other microbes, we purified wild type E. faecalis cells from the colon content of SIHUMI-colonized wild type and IL-10-/- mice using immuno-magnetic separation and performed RNA sequencing. Transcriptional profiling revealed that the bacterial environment reprograms E. faecalis gene expression in response to inflammation, with the majority of differentially expressed genes not being shared between monocolonized and SIHUMI conditions. While in E. faecalis monoassociation a general bacterial stress response could be observed, expression of E. faecalis genes in SIHUMI-colonized mice was characterized by up-regulation of genes involved in growth and replication. Interestingly, in mice colonized with SIHUMI lacking E. faecalis enhanced inflammation was observed in comparison to SIHUMI-colonized mice, supporting the hypothesis that E. faecalis ethanolamine metabolism protects against colitis in complex consortia. In conclusion, this study demonstrates that complex bacterial consortia interactions reprogram the gene expression profile and colitogenic activity of the opportunistic pathogen E. faecalis towards a protective function.},

 abstract = {High tissue density of the mammary gland is considered a pro-tumorigenic factor, hence suppressing the stimuli that induce matrix buildup carries the potential for cancer interception. We found that in non-malignant mammary epithelial cells the combination of the chemopreventive agents bexarotene (Bex) and carvedilol (Carv) suppresses the zymogen granule protein 16B (ZG16B, PAUF) through an interaction of ARID1A with a proximal enhancer. Bex + Carv also reduced ZG16B levels in vivo in normal breast tissue and MDA-MB231 tumor xenografts. The relevance of ZG16B is underscored by ongoing clinical trials targeting ZG16B in pancreatic cancers, but its role in breast cancer development is unclear. In immortalized mammary epithelial cells, secreted recombinant ZG16B stimulated mitogenic kinase phosphorylation, detachment and mesenchymal characteristics, and promoted proliferation, motility and clonogenic growth. Highly concerted induction of specific laminin, collagen and integrin isoforms indicated a shift in matrix properties toward increased density and cell-matrix interactions. Exogenous ZG16B alone blocked Bex + Carv-mediated control of cell growth and migration, and antagonized Bex + Carv-induced gene programs regulating cell adhesion and migration. In breast cancer cells ZG16B induced colony formation and anchorage-independent growth, and stimulated migration in a PI3K/Akt-dependent manner. In contrast, Bex + Carv inhibited colony formation, reduced Ki67 levels, ZG16B expression and glucose uptake in MDA-MB231 xenografts. These data establish ZG16B as a druggable pro-tumorigenic target in breast cell transformation and suggest a key role of the matrisome network in rexinoid-dependent antitumor activity.},

@article{lenz_all-trans_2021,
 abstract = {Previously we showed that the vitamin A metabolite all-trans retinoic acid (atRA) induces synaptic plasticity in acute brain slices prepared from the mouse and human neocortex (Lenz et al., 2021). Depending on the brain region studied, distinct effects of atRA on excitatory and inhibitory neurotransmission have been reported. Here, we used intraperitoneal injections of atRA (10 mg/kg) in adult C57BL/6J mice to study the effects of atRA on excitatory and inhibitory neurotransmission in the mouse fascia dentata-a brain region implicated in memory acquisition. No major changes in synaptic transmission were observed in the ventral hippocampus while a significant increase in both spontaneous excitatory postsynaptic current frequencies and synapse numbers were evident in the dorsal hippocampus 6 hr after atRA administration. The intrinsic properties of hippocampal dentate granule cells were not significantly different and hippocampal transcriptome analysis revealed no essential neuronal changes upon atRA treatment. In light of these findings, we tested for the metaplastic effects of atRA, that is, for its ability to modulate synaptic plasticity expression in the absence of major changes in baseline synaptic strength. Indeed, in vivo long-term potentiation (LTP) experiments demonstrated that systemic atRA treatment improves the ability of dentate granule cells to express LTP. The plasticity-promoting effects of atRA were not observed in synaptopodin-deficient mice, therefore, extending our previous results regarding the relevance of synaptopodin in atRA-mediated synaptic strengthening in the mouse prefrontal cortex. Taken together, our data show that atRA mediates synaptopodin-dependent metaplasticity in mouse dentate granule cells.},

@article{lenz_amyloid_2023,
 abstract = {The perforant path provides the primary cortical excitatory input to the hippocampus. Because of its important role in information processing and coding, entorhinal projections to the dentate gyrus have been studied in considerable detail. Nevertheless, synaptic transmission between individual connected pairs of entorhinal stellate cells and dentate granule cells remains to be characterized. Here, we have used mouse organotypic entorhino-hippocampal tissue cultures of either sex, in which the entorhinal cortex (EC) to dentate granule cell (GC; EC–GC) projection is present, and EC–GC pairs can be studied using whole-cell patch-clamp recordings. By using cultures of wild-type mice, the properties of EC–GC synapses formed by afferents from the lateral and medial entorhinal cortex were compared, and differences in short-term plasticity were identified. As the perforant path is severely affected in Alzheimer's disease, we used tissue cultures of amyloid precursor protein (APP)–deficient mice to examine the role of APP at this synapse. APP deficiency altered excitatory neurotransmission at medial perforant path synapses, which was accompanied by transcriptomic and ultrastructural changes. Moreover, presynaptic but not postsynaptic APP deletion through the local injection of Cre-expressing adeno-associated viruses in conditional APPflox/flox tissue cultures increased the neurotransmission efficacy at perforant path synapses. In summary, these data suggest a physiological role for presynaptic APP at medial perforant path synapses that may be adversely affected under altered APP processing conditions.
SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT The hippocampus receives input from the entorhinal cortex via the perforant path. These projections to hippocampal dentate granule cells are of utmost importance for learning and memory formation. Although there is detailed knowledge about perforant path projections, the functional synaptic properties at the level of individual connected pairs of neurons are not well understood. In this study, we investigated the role of APP in mediating functional properties and transmission rules in individually connected neurons using paired whole-cell patch-clamp recordings and genetic tools in organotypic tissue cultures. Our results show that presynaptic APP expression limits excitatory neurotransmission via the perforant path, which could be compromised in pathologic conditions such as Alzheimer's disease.},

 abstract = {Understanding the mechanisms of synaptic plasticity is crucial for elucidating how the brain adapts to internal and external stimuli. A key objective of plasticity is maintaining physiological activity states during perturbations by adjusting synaptic transmission through negative feedback mechanisms. However, identifying and characterizing novel molecular targets orchestrating synaptic plasticity remains a significant challenge. This study investigated the effects of tetrodotoxin (TTX)-induced synaptic plasticity within organotypic entorhino-hippocampal tissue cultures, offering insights into the functional, transcriptomic, and proteomic changes associated with network inhibition via voltage-gated sodium channel blockade. Our experiments demonstrate that TTX treatment induces substantial functional plasticity of excitatory synapses, as evidenced by increased miniature excitatory postsynaptic current (mEPSC) amplitudes and frequencies in both dentate granule cells and CA1 pyramidal neurons. Correlating transcriptomic and proteomic data, we identified novel targets for future research into homeostatic plasticity, including cytoglobin, SLIT-ROBO Rho GTPase Activating Protein 3, Transferrin receptor, and 3-Hydroxy-3-Methylglutaryl-CoA Synthase 1. These data provide a valuable resource for future studies aiming to understand the orchestration of homeostatic plasticity by metabolic pathways in distinct cell types of the central nervous system.},

 abstract = {La fibrosis quística (FQ) es una enfermedad crónica y progresiva, de origen genético, de herencia autosómica recesiva, causada por mutaciones en el gen que codifica para la proteína reguladora de la conductancia transmembrana de la fibrosis quística (CFTR -de sus siglas en inglés-). La disfunción de esta proteína tiene como consecuencia una deshidratación de secreciones normales de células epiteliales de diversos órganos, provocando espesamiento del moco y obstrucción de espacios. La enfermedad presenta, por lo tanto, manifestaciones multisistémicas, siendo la afección pulmonar y sus complicaciones las responsables del deterioro clínico de los pacientes. A nivel mundial se han realizado grandes esfuerzos para entender la prevalencia, el impacto clínico y evolución de infecciones pulmonares con patógenos “clásicos” de la FQ, como Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Staphylococcus aureus, Haemophilus influenzae y bacterias pertenecientes al Complejo Burkholderia cepacia (CBc). Los patógenos respiratorios en general, pueden adoptar diferentes mecanismos de adaptación y sobrevida para establecerse en un "nicho protegido" dentro del hospedador durante la infección crónica. Las estrategias más estudiadas son la formación de biofilm en las mucosas y la sobrevida intracelular, ya sea en células epiteliales o del sistema inmune del hospedador. 
En el capítulo I, a fin de responder a una problemática local y un avance a nivel mundial, estudiamos la epidemiología de un patógeno “no convencional”, o “desvalorizado” en la FQ como lo es Escherichia coli. Hicimos una caracterización fenotípica de 27 aislamientos recuperados de 7 pacientes, 3 con infección pulmonar crónica y 4 con infección transitoria. A través de la secuenciación genómica completa de 5 aislamientos recuperados secuencialmente de una de las pacientes con infección crónica realizamos la caracterización del pangenoma de los aislados y un estudio genómico comparativo para entender su evolución. Encontramos que, un linaje epidémico virulento multirresistente, de distribución global de E. coli (ST131 clado C1/H30R asociado a FluoQ-R) puede ser un colonizador persistente de las vías aéreas de las personas con FQ. Encontramos que este clon puede adaptarse y persistir como infección pulmonar crónica porque posee la capacidad de experimentar cambios fenotípicos y genómicos similares a los que experimentan los "patógenos clásicos” de FQ. 
En el capítulo II, estudiamos a Burkholderia contaminans, una especie del complejo Burkholderia cepacia, frecuente en ciertos países de América Latina y Europa, que puede causar infección pulmonar crónica en personas con fibrosis quística. Buscamos obtener información sobre las infecciones pulmonares a largo plazo con un enfoque en la búsqueda de los fenotípicos bacterianos que resultan marcadores del pronóstico clínico de los pacientes. Se investigaron las características genotípicas de 85 aislamientos de B. contaminans recuperados de 70 pacientes. Para 16 de esos pacientes, analizamos el estado clínico y las características fenotípicas bacterianas. La aparición de ciertos fenotipos bacterianos en la infección crónica como el fenotipo no mucoide, variantes de colonias pequeñas, colonias pigmentadas e hipermutadores, junto a la co-infección con Pseudomonas aeruginosa, han sido identificados como posibles marcadores de infecciones más desafiantes y de mal pronóstico. Nuestros estudios han revelado que la presencia de co-colonizadores y los fenotipos bacterianos especialmente adaptados para persistir en las infecciones del tracto respiratorio a largo plazo desempeñan un papel crucial en la evolución clínicos de los pacientes. 
Por último, en el capítulo III nos propusimos desarrollar una herramienta para avanzar en el conocimiento sobre el patrimonio genético de B. contaminans y su capacidad de adaptación y persistencia en el hospedador. Existe aún para estos organismos una interesante controversia en torno a la/las formas de colonización y persistencia: ¿es el biofilm, la sobrevida intracelular, o tal vez una combinación de ambas, lo que les permite persistir en la infección crónica? Con el objetivo de dilucidar estos, entre otros controvertidos interrogantes, se diseñó un vector eficaz para desarrollar técnicas de secuenciación de inserción de transposones. Este vector resultó ser una herramienta eficiente tanto en Burkholderia contaminans como Burkholderia puraquae, que nos permitirá aumentar significativamente el acceso al conocimiento genético de estas especies de las que queda aún mucho por estudiar.},

 abstract = {\&lt;h4\&gt;Background\&lt;/h4\&gt;Nitrate (NO\&lt;sub\&gt;3\&lt;/sub\&gt; \&lt;sup\&gt;-\&lt;/sup\&gt;) can accumulate in closed-circuit ecosystems to a toxic level. Adding heterotrophic denitrification process to the water treatment is a strategy to reduce this level. This type of process usually requires the addition of a carbon source. Carbon-to-nitrogen ratio (C/N) is a key parameter known to influence both the function and the activity of microbial communities in bioprocesses. Few studies have examined the influence of C/N on denitrification systems operated under methylotrophic and marine conditions. Here we assessed the influence of C/N (methanol and NO\&lt;sub\&gt;3\&lt;/sub\&gt; \&lt;sup\&gt;-\&lt;/sup\&gt;) on the performance of a laboratory-scale, recirculating denitrifying reactor operated under marine conditions. We monitored the evolution of the bacterial community in the biofilm to assess its stability during the operating conditions. Finally, the relative gene expression profiles of \&lt;i\&gt;Methylophaga nitratireducenticrescens\&lt;/i\&gt; strain GP59, the main denitrifier in the denitrifying biofilm, were determined during the operating conditions and compared with those of GP59 planktonic pure cultures.\&lt;h4\&gt;Methodology\&lt;/h4\&gt;A 500-mL methanol-fed recirculating denitrification reactor operated under marine conditions and colonized by a naturally occurring multispecies denitrifying biofilm was subjected to eight different C/N. We monitored several physico-chemical parameters (denitrifying activities, methanol consumption, CO\&lt;sub\&gt;2\&lt;/sub\&gt; production) throughout the operating conditions. The evolution of the bacterial community in the biofilm during these conditions was determined by 16S rRNA gene amplicon sequencing. Metatranscriptomes were derived from the biofilm to determine (1) the relative gene expression profiles of strain GP59, and (2) the functional diversity of the active microorganisms in the biofilm.\&lt;h4\&gt;Results\&lt;/h4\&gt;Changes in C/N did not correlate with the denitrification dynamics (NO\&lt;sub\&gt;3\&lt;/sub\&gt; \&lt;sup\&gt;-\&lt;/sup\&gt; and NO\&lt;sub\&gt;2\&lt;/sub\&gt; \&lt;sup\&gt;-\&lt;/sup\&gt; reduction rates, NO\&lt;sub\&gt;2\&lt;/sub\&gt; \&lt;sup\&gt;-\&lt;/sup\&gt; and N\&lt;sub\&gt;2\&lt;/sub\&gt;O dynamics), but did correlate with the methanol consumption rates, and the CO\&lt;sub\&gt;2\&lt;/sub\&gt; production rates. Throughout the operating conditions, nitrite and N\&lt;sub\&gt;2\&lt;/sub\&gt;O appeared transiently, and ammonium was not observed. The bacterial community in the reactor increased in diversity with biofilm aging, especially among heterotrophic bacteria, at the expense of methylotrophic bacteria. The relative expression profiles of strain GP59 in the biofilm are distinct from those of planktonic pure cultures of strain GP59, and that the expression of several riboswitches and \&lt;i\&gt;xoxF\&lt;/i\&gt; would be involved in these differences.\&lt;h4\&gt;Conclusions\&lt;/h4\&gt;When the biofilm community is well established in the reactor, it can withstand changes in C/N with limited impact on the denitrification performance. The increase in the proportion of heterotrophs would allow the reactor to be more flexible regarding carbon sources. This knowledge can be useful for improving the efficiency of denitrification system treating close circuit systems such as marine recirculating aquaculture wastewater or seawater aquarium.},

 abstract = {Sex-determining genes remain largely uncharacterized outside classical models in vertebrates and insects, leaving a gap in our understanding of their evolutionary emergence. The terrestrial isopod Armadillidium vulgare provides an excellent model for investigating this question, as it presents multiple genetic sex determinants. Some lineages possess a masculinizing dominant allele at a locus called the ‘M gene’, which is analogous to an XY system. This allele is hypothesized to have been selected due to the deficit of males caused by a non-Mendelian feminizing factor previously described. The existence of the M gene was inferred from crosses carried out in the 1990s, but its molecular nature remains unresolved. Here, we conducted a genome-wide single-nucleotide polymorphisms analysis combining pooled sequencing of male and female progenies with sequencing of individual parents across two families. Bayesian estimation of haplotype frequencies in progenies pinpointed a candidate genomic region of approximately two megabases. Notably, this region contains the gene encoding the androgenic gland hormone, a protein involved in male sexual differentiation. Our findings lay the groundwork for functional investigations of the M gene, offering novel insights into the dynamics of sex determination in terrestrial isopods and into the turnover of sex chromosomes in response to sex-ratio distortion.},

@article{li_functional_2025,
 abstract = {Camptothecin (CAM), a well-known plant-derived antitumor compound, is a structurally complex pentacyclic pyrroloquinoline monoterpene indole alkaloid (MIA) found in various plant species. As a specific MIA, CAM had been thought to share a common upstream biosynthetic pathway with other MIAs such as the antitumor vinblastine and vincristine from Catharanthus roseus. Nevertheless the key enzymes responsible for the consecutive three-step oxidation of the –CH3 of nepetalactol to form the –COOH of 7-deoxyloganetic acid and the subsequent glycosylation of 7-deoxyloganetic acid to yield 7-deoxyloganic acid have yet to be functionally characterized. Here we established an in vivo tandem catalysis assay for the enzymatic catalytic activity characterization of 7-deoxyloganetic acid synthase (7DLS) and 7-deoxyloganetic acid glucosyltransferase (7DLGT), two crucial catalytic enzymes in MIAs biosynthesis, thereby avoiding the difficulty in the detection of the unstable biosynthetic intermediates. The enzyme activity assay platform was conducted through the co-expression of functionally characterized Cr7DLS and Cr7DLGT in Saccharomyces cerevisiae WAT11, substrate feeding, and enzymatic product verification. Two cytochrome P450 enzymes (CYPs) from Camptotheca acuminata, the prestigious resource for CAM, CaCYP76A75 and CaCYP76A76, were identified and functionally characterized to be responsible for the consecutive three-step oxidation of nepetalactol to yield 7-deoxyloganetic acid through reciprocal replacement of Cr7DLS in the in vivo tandem enzyme activity assay platform. Two uridine 5′-diphosphate glycosyltransferases (UGTs), CaUGT709C10 and CaUGT709C11, were functionally characterized to be capable of glycosylating 7-deoxyloganetic acid to yield 7-deoxyloganic acid. This study provides two CYPs as 7DLSs and two UGTs as 7DLGTs, offering potential applications in MIAs biosynthesis.},

 abstract = {Macellicephaloides Uschakov, 1955 (Annelida: Polynoidae) is a genus of deep-sea polychaetes characterized by a specialized pharynx bearing two pairs of jaws (with the dorsal pair fused) and three pairs of lateral papillae, the middle pair of which is greatly elongated, and remarkable adaptability to diverse deep-sea habitats. Most species in this genus inhabit abyssal depths ({\textgreater}7200 m), with high diversity in western Pacific trenches, while a few occur in relatively shallow habitats such as deep-sea seamounts and hydrothermal vents. This paper presents a new species, Macellicephaloides lingshuiensis sp. nov., found in deep-sea cold seeps in the South China Sea, representing the shallowest distribution record for the genus to date and the first record from cold seep environments. The classification and phylogeny of Macellicephaloides and related genera have long been the subject of debate. A previous study suggested that Macellicephaloides is nested within the Macellicephala clade, but our analyses-based on 13 mitochondrial protein-coding genes, 12S, 16S, 18S, 28S rRNA, and ITS1-ITS2 sequences-tentatively indicate that these two genera form independent evolutionary clades. Additionally, our phylogeny indicates a close evolutionary relationship between deep-sea Macellicephaloides and cave-dwelling polynoids (e.g., Gesiella), highlighting ecological connections between deep-sea and cave habitats. These conclusions are supported by morphological comparisons and genetic distance analyses. Although the subfamily Macellicephalinae is recovered as a monophyletic group, intergeneric phylogenetic relationships within it remain unresolved, highlighting the need for additional data from more species and genera. We amend the generic diagnosis of Macellicephaloides and provide an identification key to all valid species in the genus. This study clarifies the taxonomy and phylogeny of Macellicephaloides and related taxa, emphasizing the importance of continued sampling in understudied deep-sea habitats to enhance our understanding of their biodiversity.},

 abstract = {An adaptive feature of malaria-causing parasites is the digestion of host hemoglobin (HB) to acquire amino acids (AAs). Here we describe a link between nutrient availability and translation dependent regulation of gene expression as an adaptive strategy. We show that tRNA expression in Plasmodium falciparum does not match the decoding need expected for optimal translation. A subset of tRNAs decoding AAs that are insufficiently provided by HB are lowly expressed, wherein the abundance of a protein-coding transcript is negatively correlated with the decoding requirement of these tRNAs. Proliferation-related genes have evolved a high requirement of these tRNAs, thereby proliferation can be modulated by repressing protein synthesis of these genes during nutrient stress. We conclude that the parasite modulates translation elongation by maintaining a discordant tRNA profile to exploit variations in AA-composition among genes as an adaptation strategy. This study exemplifies metabolic adaptation as an important driving force for protein evolution.},

 abstract = {Podocyte maintenance and stress resistance are exquisitely based on high basal rates of autophagy making these cells a unique model to unravel mechanisms of autophagy regulation. Polyamines have key cellular functions such as proliferation, nucleic acid biosynthesis and autophagy. Here we test whether endogenous spermidine signaling is a driver of basal and dynamic autophagy in podocytes by using genetic and pharmacologic approaches to interfere with different steps of polyamine metabolism. Translational studies revealed altered spermidine signaling in focal segmental glomerulosclerosis in vivo and in vitro. Exogenous spermidine supplementation emerged as new treatment strategy by successfully activating autophagy in vivo via inhibition of EP300, a protein with an essential role in controlling cell growth, cell division and prompting cells to differentiate to take on specialized functions. Surprisingly, gas chromatography-mass spectroscopy based untargeted metabolomics of wild type and autophagy deficient primary podocytes revealed a positive feed-back mechanism whereby autophagy itself maintains polyamine metabolism and spermidine synthesis. The transcription factor MAFB acted as an upstream regulator of polyamine metabolism. Thus, our data highlight a novel positive feedback loop of autophagy and spermidine signaling allowing maintenance of high basal levels of autophagy as a key mechanism to sustain the filtration barrier. Hence, spermidine supplementation may emerge as a new therapeutic to restore autophagy in glomerular disease.},

Integrative species delimitation via multiple types can provide a robust framework for accurate species identification and rapid discovery of cryptic diversity. The subgenus Tliponius (Hemiptera: Coreidae: Homoeocerus) has several species and three broadly distributed species across China. In this study, we selected as many geographical sample sites of widely distributed species as possible and conducted species identification based on integrated taxonomy of morphological, mitochondrial and SNP data for 28 individuals within Tliponius. Our results revealed a cryptic lineage previously subsumed under the polytypic H. unipunctatus in Yunnan Province and described as Homoeocerus (Tliponius) dianensis Liang, Li \& Bu sp. nov. The presence of seven distinct species within Tliponius was supported by species delimitation and divided into two clades: (H. dilatatus + (H. marginellus + (H. unipunctatus + H. dianensis sp. nov.))) and (H. yunnanensis + (H. laevilineus + H. marginiventris). Based on our findings, extensive sampling of widespread species is highly important for the accuracy of species delimitation and the discovery of cryptic species.},

 abstract = {This study sequenced and assembled the mitochondrial genome of the rare dragonfly species Libellula melli, and submitted the results to the NCBI GenBank database, obtaining the accession number PP588458. The mitochondrial genome spans a total length of 15,149 bp, encompassing 13 protein-coding genes (PCGs), 22 tRNA genes, 2 rRNA genes, and a control region or D-loop. Of these, 25 genes and segments are located on the heavy strand (H-strand), while the remaining 13 reside on the light strand (L-strand). The nucleotide composition of the L. melli mitochondrial genome exhibits a prominent AT bias (AT = 73.3 \%), with T, C, A, and G bases comprising 34.5 \%, 15.6 \%, 38.8 \%, and 11.1 \% respectively, displaying a positive AT skew of 0.059. Among the 13 PCGs, the primary start codons are ATT, ATG, and TTG, while the primary stop codons are TAA, with instances of TA(C) and T(AT) also observed. RSCU analysis reveals that the most frequently used codon is UUA, with an RSCU value of 3.75, encoding leucine (Leu). The secondary structures of the proteins encoded by the 13 PCGs generally exhibit a trend of α-helix {\textgreater} random coil {\textgreater} extended strand {\textgreater} β-turn. Phylogenetic analysis uncovers the phylogenetic relationships of L. melli within the reported Libellulidae species, revealing (((((((L. melli + L. quadrimaculata) + L. angelina) + ((O. chrysis + O. glaucum) + O. albistylum)) + ((C. servilia servilia + T. virginia) + N. fulvia) + (L. albifrons + S. eroticum)) + (P. flavescens + T. aurora)) + (D. phaon + H. croceus)) + (B. contaminate + P. zonata)).

 abstract = {Delectopecten is a small genus of the family Pectinidae (Bivalvia: Pectinida) that remains poorly studied in terms of both morphology and phylogeny. Here, we describe the first member of this genus from deep-sea hydrothermal vent ecosystems, D. thermus sp. nov., based on morphological investigations and molecular analyses of a specimen collected from the Higashi–Ensei vent field (962-m depth) in the northern Okinawa Trough. Morphologically, this new species resembles D. vancouverensis and D. gelatinosus in shell size, shape, auricle size and sculpture. However, D. thermus sp. nov. can be distinguished from its congeneric species (including 9 extant and 12 fossil species) by its unequal auricles (the anterior one being larger than the posterior), inwardly recurved anterior auricle of the left valve and a large byssal notch angle of {\textasciitilde}90°. Comparisons of genetic sequences from three mitochondrial and three nuclear gene fragments supported the placement of the new species in the genus Delectopecten. Further phylogenetic analyses using these gene markers support that Delectopecten is monophyletic and positioned as an early diverging clade of the family Pectinidae. Additionally, the mitogenome of D. thermus sp. nov. was assembled and annotated, a first for its genus – revealing significant divergences in gene order compared to other pectinids. The 16S rRNA amplicon analysis of the gill tissue indicated that this vent-dwelling scallop does not exhibit symbiosis with chemosynthetic bacteria. A key to all known species of Delectopecten is provided to aid the identification of species in this understudied genus. ZooBank: urn:lsid:zoobank.org:pub:D3D5D4AD-EE39-49F0-9782-12A5D6752A67},

The strains form lupine moromi could not convincingly be assigned to one of the current subspecies. Taken together with strain specific differences in the carbohydrate metabolism (arabinose, mannitol, melibiose, gluconate, galactonate) and amino acid degradation pathways such as arginine deiminase pathway (ADI) and the agmatine deiminase pathway (AgDI) the biodiversity in the species of T. halophilus is greater than expected.

Furthermore, we use strain TP1 to select for increased resistance to five of the phages in vitro, and identify mutations that are also found in phage-insensitive isolates TP2 and TP3 (which evolved in vivo during phage treatment).

Although many bioinformatics tools have been developed to address this problem, there is still a lack of special introduction to loop-calling algorithms. This review provides an overview of the loop-calling tools for various 3C-based techniques. We first discuss the background biases produced by different experimental techniques and the denoising algorithms. Then, the completeness and priority of each tool are categorized and summarized according to the data source of application. The summary of these works can help researchers select the most appropriate method to call loops and further perform downstream analysis. In addition, this survey is also useful for bioinformatics scientists aiming to develop new loop-calling algorithms.},

 abstract = {Hypersensitivity to mechanical stimuli is a cardinal symptom of neuropathic and inflammatory pain. A reduction in spinal inhibition is generally considered a causal factor in the development of mechanical hypersensitivity after injury. However, the extent to which presynaptic inhibition contributes to altered spinal inhibition is less well established. Here, we used conditional deletion of GABA$_{\textrm{A}}$ in NaV1.8-positive sensory neurons (\textit{Scn10a$^{\textrm{Cre}}$};\textit{Gabrb3$^{\textrm{fl/fl}}$}) to manipulate selectively presynaptic GABAergic inhibition. Behavioral testing showed that the development of inflammatory punctate allodynia was mitigated in mice lacking pre-synaptic GABA$_{\textrm{A}}$. Dorsal horn cellular circuits were visualized in single slices using stimulus-tractable dual-labelling of \textit{c-fos} mRNA for punctate and the cognate c-Fos protein for dynamic mechanical stimulation. This revealed a substantial reduction in the number of cells activated by punctate stimulation in mice lacking presynaptic GABA$_{\textrm{A}}$ and an approximate 50\% overlap of the punctate with the dynamic circuit, the relative percentage of which did not change following inflammation. The reduction in dorsal horn cells activated by punctate stimuli was equally prevalent in parvalbumin- and calretinin-positive cells and across all laminae I-V, indicating a generalized reduction in spinal input. In peripheral DRG neurons, inflammation following complete Freund's adjuvant (CFA) led to an increase in axonal excitability responses to GABA, suggesting that presynaptic GABA effects in NaV1.8$^{\textrm{+}}$ afferents switch from inhibition to excitation after CFA.

 abstract = {Until now, although different studies have shown the potential prebiotic effect of seaweed carbohydrates, no studies with the whole seaweeds have been carried out. In addition, the prebiotic effect throughput sequencing remains poorly investigated since most of the published works used qPCR or FISH to estimate bacterial changes. In this work, an in vitro model of the human distal colon was used to determine, for the first time, the potential prebiotic effect of a brown whole seaweed Himanthalia elongata. The whole seaweed was characterized in basis of its nutritional and mineral composition and submitted to the entire gastrointestinal digestion. The prebiotic effect was evaluated by the microbial modulation through 16S rRNA amplicon sequencing, qPCR and short-chain fatty acid analysis. The obtained results indicated that the colonic fraction of H. elongata was used selectively by the Bacteroides genus, more specifically by the specie Bacteoides ovatus, whereas inulin was used mainly by the Parabacteroides genus, being Parabacteroides distasonis the most abundant identified specie. Selective use of inulin by P. distasonis is, therefore, reported by the first time. qPCR analysis shown no significative differences in Bifidobacterium population and a decrease in Lactobacillus along the fermentation assays with both substrates. Regarding to the short-fatty acid production, maximal concentration, 56.11 ± 20.48 mM, was achieved for H. elongata, at 24 h of fermentation whereas for inulin total acid production was 93.66 ± 21.82 mM at 48 h of assay. The metabolic pathways associated with bacterial genera were not significantly different between the two tested substrates. Although more studies are necessary to elucidate the prebiotic character of H. elongata, the results presented in this work are promissory and could open new opportunities of research and application in the area of Nutrition and Food Chemistry.},

 abstract = {In this study, an undervalued marine crustacean (\textit{Talitrus saltator}) was characterized in terms of nutritional and heavy metal composition and its potential to affect human gut microbiota. Nutritional analysis of this crustacean revealed that it complies with the criteria established in European legislation to include nutritional claims in their labeling, such as "source of fiber," "low in fat," "low in sugars" and "high in protein." The analysis of the heavy metal content did not reveal any risk derived from the presence of Cd, Hg, or Pb, whereas essential metals contained in 100 g exceeded the minimum daily requirements recommended in Europe for Zn (19.78 mg/kg), Cu (2.28 mg/kg), and Fe (32.96 mg/kg). Using an \textit{in vitro} system, the effect of \textit{T. saltator} on the human colonic microbiota shows some beneficial effects, such as fermentation-maintained populations of \textit{Bifidobacterium} or \textit{Lactobacillus}, did not increase Firmicutes \textit{phylum} counts, decreased the Firmicutes/Bacteroidetes ratio, and stimulated 11 metabolic pathways with respect to baseline. These results are unusual in a high protein content-food. However, negative effects were also found in gut microbiota relative proportions, such as an increase in the Proteobacteria \textit{phylum} and especially some opportunistic bacteria from this \textit{phylum}, probably due to the antimicrobial effect of chitin on other groups more sensitive to its effect. This work shows for the first time the effect of \textit{T. saltator} on human colonic microbiota using and \textit{in vitro} system. The presence of chitin in its composition could provide some beneficial effects by modulating the microbiota, but as \textit{T. saltator} is a high-protein food, more studies should be carried out showing these benefits.},

 abstract = {Chitin is an abundant natural polysaccharide that is hard to degrade because of its crystalline nature and because it is embedded in robust co-polymeric materials containing other polysaccharides, proteins, and minerals. Thus, it is of interest to study the enzymatic machineries of specialized microbes found in chitin-rich environments. We describe a genomic and proteomic analysis of \textit{Andreprevotia ripae}, a chitinolytic Gram-negative bacterium isolated from an anthill. The genome of \textit{A. ripae} encodes four secreted family GH19 chitinases of which two were detected and upregulated during growth on chitin. In addition, the genome encodes as many as 25 secreted GH18 chitinases, of which 17 were detected and 12 were upregulated during growth on chitin. Finally, the single lytic polysaccharide monooxygenase (LPMO) was strongly upregulated during growth on chitin. Whereas 66\% of the 29 secreted chitinases contained two carbohydrate-binding modules (CBMs), this fraction was 93\% (13 out of 14) for the upregulated chitinases, suggesting an important role for these CBMs. Next to an unprecedented multiplicity of upregulated chitinases, this study reveals several chitin-induced proteins that contain chitin-binding CBMs but lack a known catalytic function. These proteins are interesting targets for discovery of enzymes used by nature to convert chitin-rich biomass. The MS proteomic data have been deposited in the PRIDE database with accession number PXD025087.},

 abstract = {\textit{Sphaerophoria rueppellii} is a Palearctic hoverfly widely used as a native biocontrol agent against aphid pests in Mediterranean agroecosystems. In this study, we present a cytogenetic analysis and characterization of the mitochondrial genome of this species. Chromosomal preparations, obtained from third-instar larvae, were used for conventional staining, DAPI staining and C-banding techniques, and major ribosomal DNA (rDNA) location by fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH). Karyotype analysis revealed a diploid number of 2n = 10, with heterochromatic blocks in the pericentromeric regions of all autosomes and rDNA clusters on both sex chromosomes. The complete mitochondrial genome (16,605 bp) was sequenced and annotated using next-generation sequencing and assembly pipelines. It contains the typical 37 mitochondrial genes and a highly A + T-rich control region with tandem repeats. Gene order and codon usage were conserved compared with other Syrphidae. Phylogenetic reconstruction based on mitochondrial protein-coding genes clarifies the species' placement within the Syrphini tribe. Our results contribute valuable genomic and cytogenetic information that supports comparative analyses and may aid in taxonomic clarification within the genus. These findings also offer key data that could guide the genetic optimization of \textit{S. rueppellii} as an efficient, environmentally safe biological control agent in sustainable agriculture.},

 abstract = {An important unmet need revealed by the COVID-19 pandemic is the near-real-time identification of potentially fitness-altering mutations within rapidly growing SARS-CoV-2 lineages. Although powerful molecular sequence analysis methods are available to detect and characterize patterns of natural selection within modestly sized gene-sequence datasets, the computational complexity of these methods and their sensitivity to sequencing errors render them effectively inapplicable in large-scale genomic surveillance contexts. Motivated by the need to analyze new lineage evolution in near-real time using large numbers of genomes, we developed the Rapid Assessment of Selection within CLades (RASCL) pipeline. RASCL applies state of the art phylogenetic comparative methods to evaluate selective processes acting at individual codon sites and across whole genes. RASCL is scalable and produces automatically updated regular lineage-specific selection analysis reports: even for lineages that include tens or hundreds of thousands of sampled genome sequences. Key to this performance is (i) generation of automatically subsampled high quality datasets of gene/ORF sequences drawn from a selected "query" viral lineage; (ii) contextualization of these query sequences in codon alignments that include high-quality "background" sequences representative of global SARS-CoV-2 diversity; and (iii) the extensive parallelization of a suite of computationally intensive selection analysis tests. Within hours of being deployed to analyze a novel rapidly growing lineage of interest, RASCL will begin yielding JavaScript Object Notation (JSON)-formatted reports that can be either imported into third-party analysis software or explored in standard web-browsers using the premade RASCL interactive data visualization dashboard. By enabling the rapid detection of genome sites evolving under different selective regimes, RASCL is well-suited for near-real-time monitoring of the population-level selective processes that will likely underlie the emergence of future variants of concern in measurably evolving pathogens with extensive genomic surveillance.},

 abstract = {Elucidating the regulatory mechanisms of human brain evolution is essential to understanding human cognition and mental disorders. We generated multi-omics profiles and constructed a high-resolution map of 3D genome architecture of rhesus macaque during corticogenesis. By comparing the 3D genomes of human, macaque, and mouse brains, we identified many human-specific chromatin structure changes, including 499 topologically associating domains (TADs) and 1,266 chromatin loops. The human-specific loops are significantly enriched in enhancer-enhancer interactions, and the regulated genes show human-specific expression changes in the subplate, a transient zone of the developing brain critical for neural circuit formation and plasticity. Notably, many human-specific sequence changes are located in the human-specific TAD boundaries and loop anchors, which may generate new transcription factor binding sites and chromatin structures in human. Collectively, the presented data highlight the value of comparative 3D genome analyses in dissecting the regulatory mechanisms of brain development and evolution.},

 abstract = {Background: Lonchodidae is the largest family within the order Phasmatodea, and although many studies have been conducted on this family, the monophyly of the family has not been established. Methods: Eight mitogenomes from Lonchodidae, including the first complete mitogenomes of four genera, were sequenced and annotated to explore their features and phylogenetic relationships. Results: The total length ranged from 15,942–18,021 bp, and the mitogenome consisted of 13 protein-coding genes (PCGs), 22 tRNA genes, 2 rRNA genes, and a control region (CR). atp8 had the highest A + T content in Lonchodidae, except for Neohirasea stephanus and Asceles clavatus, in which the highest A + T contents were detected in nad6. The phylogenetic trees were reconstructed via Bayesian inference (BI) and maximum likelihood (ML) based on the PCG123 and PCG12 datasets. As the phylogenetic trees show, Necrosciinae is recognized as monophyletic, but the monophyly of Lonchodinae has not been supported. Gene deletion and rearrangement have occurred mainly in Lonchodidae and Aschiphasmatidae. The most common reason for gene rearrangements was tandem duplication random loss (TDRL), but trnI of Stheneboea repudiosa inverted into the CR. In addition, genes within the same family or genus share related sequences and conserved gene blocks. Conclusions: we expanded the mitochondrial genomic data for this family, thereby establishing a foundational dataset for future studies.},

While V. vulnificus is a generally well-characterized environmental pathogen, V. cidicii and V. navarrensis are relatively rare, recently identified species that our current understanding of virulence and environmental adaptation is limited. Here, we investigate genetic relatedness across these three species to identify shared and species-specific genes, including markers of virulence. Using publicly available genome assemblies (n = 76), we evaluated phylogenetic and genomic diversity across this clade. We sampled all available V. navarrensis and V. cidicii genomes and a biodiverse curated set of four V. vulnificus ecotypes to ensure representative coverage. Our results indicate that all three species share 2,313 core genes, many of which are core bacterial functions in addition to pathways important to environmental response, host immune evasion, and iron acquisition. Moreover, V. cidicii and V. navarrensis have extensive genetic similarity between them, including average nucleotide identities {\textgreater}95\% and 370 shared genes. Despite this similarity, they both remain more phylogenetically distant from V. vulnificus and lack key virulence genes, such as rtxA, indicating alternative pathogenic potential. Overall, these findings reveal distinct evolutionary strategies within the Vulnificus clade, with V. vulnificus specializing in enhanced pathogenesis, while V. navarrensis and V. cidicii have evolved enhanced environmental persistence capabilities.ImportanceVibrio species are important environmental aquatic bacteria that pose a threat to human and animal health across the globe. This study applied comparative genomics to investigate the genetic relatedness of Vibrio vulnificus, Vibrio navarrensis, and Vibrio cidicii, with special focus on genes associated with environmental adaptation and virulence between and within each species. Results indicate V. navarrensis and V. cidicii share many genes, are phylogenetically close, and exhibit genomic signatures of enhanced environmental persistence and stress tolerance in addition to survival in anthropogenically impacted marine systems. Furthermore, V. vulnificus possesses an overall different virulence potential with the presence of RTX systems. This adds to our understanding of genetic diversity and pathogenic mechanisms within an important group of marine pathogens.},

Six Sst encoding genes (sst1 to sst6) have been identified in teleost fish genomes but little is known about their function. The present study aimed at replicating the context of the inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) and clarifying the involvement of sst3 in the intestine innate defence barrier in zebrafish larvae. We first established a CRISP/Cas9 sst3 deficient line (MT) and analysed the morphological and transcriptomic response to 0.4\% dextran sulfate sodium (DSS). Alcian blue staining of larval sections 6 days post fertilization showed an increased in acidic mucins in the intestinal bulb and mid-intestine, with a much stronger response in the MT compared to wild type (WT). The transcriptomic analysis revealed that WT and MT shared enriched gene ontology (GO) terms and pathways linked to catabolism, chondrocyte development, innate immune system, xenobiotic metabolism and oxidative stress. In contrast, the WT specific response to DSS was enriched in GO terms and pathways linked to transcription and translation, various developmental processes, regulation of biosynthetic processes, apelin signalling and apoptosis while the MT specific response included terms and pathways linked to protein metabolism and catabolic processes, extracellular matrix – receptor interaction and proteasome and chondrocyte development. Overall, this study demonstrated that Sst3 deficiency impairs insulin growth factor and adipocytokine signalling exacerbating the inflammatory response to DSS.},

Weighted gene co-expression network analysis (WGCNA) was applied to identify gene modules associated with citrus species, tissue types, and days post-infection (DPIs). These modules revealed significant enrichment in biological pathways related to stress responses, metabolic reprograming, ribosomal protein synthesis, chloroplast and plastid function, cellular architecture, and intracellular transport. The results offer a molecular framework for understanding HLB pathogenesis and host response. By elucidating module-specific functions and their correlation with species- and tissue-specific responses, this study provides a robust foundation for identifying key genetic targets.

 abstract = {Mycophenolate Mofetil (MMF) is a commonly prescribed immunosuppressant that demonstrates important clinical relevance. However, MMF therapy is linked to frequent gastrointestinal (GI) side effects that limit its use. Little is known about the mechanisms underlying MMF-induced GI injury. Using a primary mouse colon organoid model, we have found that mycophenolic acid (MPA), the pharmacologically active metabolite of MMF, significantly alters intestinal barrier function and permeability through modulation of tight junctions. RNA sequencing revealed that MPA significantly disrupted pathways related to cell cycle regulation, DNA replication, cytoskeleton dynamics, and suppression of senescence. MPA was observed to significantly reduce cellular proliferation, which was ameliorated through guanosine supplementation. Addition of exogenous guanosine was also observed to significantly restore barrier function back to control levels. The guanosine studies presented in this thesis suggest MPA’s inhibition of nucleotide metabolism is not selective for lymphocytes but is broader than originally described. This work represents one of the first investigations of MPA using a colon organoid model, providing critical insights into the intracellular mechanisms of MPA-induced GI toxicity.},

 abstract = {Reduction of insulin/insulin-like growth factor 1 (IGF1) signaling (IIS) promotes longevity across species. In the nematode \textit{Caenorhabditis elegans}, ablation of germline stem cells (GSCs) and activity changes of the conserved signaling mediators \textit{unc-43/CaMKII} (calcium/calmodulin-dependent kinase type II) and \textit{egl-8/PLCβ} (phospholipase Cβ) also increase lifespan. Like IIS, these pathways depend on the conserved transcription factor \textit{daf-16/FOXO} for lifespan extension, but how they functionally interact is unknown. Here, we show that altered \textit{unc-43/egl-8} activity further increases the lifespan of long-lived GSC-deficient worms, but not of worms that are long-lived due to a strong reduction-of-function mutation in the insulin/IGF1-like receptor \textit{daf-2}. Additionally, we provide evidence for \textit{unc-43} and, to a lesser extent, \textit{egl-8} modulating the expression of certain collagen genes, which were reported to be dispensable for longevity of these particular \textit{daf-2} mutant worms, but not for other forms of longevity. Together, these results provide new insights into the conditions and potential mechanisms by which CaMKII- and PLCβ-signals modulate \textit{C. elegans} lifespan.},

In humans, the MBK-1 ortholog DYRK1A is associated with a variety of disorders, most prominently with neurological defects observed in Down syndrome. To better understand mbk-1's physiological roles and their dependence on genetic background, we analyzed the influence of mbk-1 loss on the transcriptomes of wildtype and long-lived, germline-deficient or insulin-receptor defective, C. elegans strains by RNA-sequencing.{\textless}h4{\textgreater}Results{\textless}/h4{\textgreater}mbk-1 loss elicited global changes in transcription that were less pronounced in insulin-receptor mutant than in germline-deficient or wildtype C. elegans. Irrespective of genetic background, mbk-1 regulated genes were enriched for functions in biological processes related to organic acid metabolism and pathogen defense. qPCR-studies confirmed mbk-1 dependent induction of all three C. elegans Δ9-fatty acid desaturases, fat-5, fat-6 and fat-7, in wildtype, germline-deficient and insulin-receptor mutant strains. Conversely, mbk-1 dependent expression patterns of selected pathogen resistance genes, including asp-12, dod-24 and drd-50, differed across the genetic backgrounds examined. Finally, cth-1 and cysl-2, two genes which connect pathogen resistance to the metabolism of the gaseous messenger and lifespan regulator hydrogen sulfide (H$_{\textrm{2}}$S), were commonly suppressed by mbk-1 loss only in wildtype and germline-deficient, but not in insulin-receptor mutant C. elegans.{\textless}h4{\textgreater}Conclusion{\textless}/h4{\textgreater}Our work reveals previously unknown roles of C. elegans mbk-1 in the regulation of fatty acid desaturase- and H$_{\textrm{2}}$S metabolic-genes.

In response to these temporal cues, bacteria have been known to exhibit anticipatory regulation, whereby triggering response to a yet to appear cue. Such an anticipatory response in known to enhance Darwinian fitness, and hence, is likely an important feature of regulatory networks in microorganisms. However, the conditions under which an anticipatory response evolves as an adaptive response are not known. In this work, we develop a quantitative model to study response of a population to two temporal environmental cues, and predict variables which are likely important for evolution of anticipatory regulatory response. We follow this with experimental evolution of \textit{Escherichia coli} in alternating environments of rhamnose and paraquat for ∼850 generations. We demonstrate that growth in this cyclical environment leads to evolution of anticipatory regulation. As a result, pre-exposure to rhamnose leads to a greater fitness in paraquat environment. Genome sequencing reveals that this anticipatory regulation is encoded \textit{via} mutations in global regulators. Overall, our study contributes to understanding of how environment shapes the topology of regulatory networks in an organism.},

 abstract = {Adaptive divergence leading to speciation is the major evolutionary process generating diversity in life forms. The most commonly observed form of speciation is allopatric speciation which requires that gene flow be prevented between populations by physical or temporal barriers, as they adapt to their respective environments. Eventually, these adaptive responses drive the populations far apart in the genotypic space such that individuals from the two populations become reproductively isolated. A widely accepted theory is that speciation simply occurs as a by-product of adaptive response of the populations 1,2 . Several ecological and laboratory examples of allopatric speciation exist 3–6 . However, we know little about the nature (pre- or post-zygotic) of barriers that arise first in this process. Understanding the first barriers that arise between populations is key, as populations diverge towards becoming distinct species. In recent years, fungi been used as model organisms to answer questions related to evolution of reproductive isolation 3,7–9 . Here we show rapid evolution of pre-zygotic barriers between allopatric yeast populations. We further demonstrate that these pre-zygotic barriers arise due to altered mating kinetics of the evolved population. Moreover, our non-adaptive evolution experiments with yeast under limited selection pressure also show rapid emergence of reproductive isolation. Overall, our results show that evolution of pre-zygotic reproductive barriers can occur as result of natural selection or drift. These barriers result because of altered mating kinetics or mate preference. {\textless}h4{\textgreater}One sentence summary{\textless}/h4{\textgreater} Pre-zygotic barriers to gene flow can arise due to adaptation or drift.},

 abstract = {{\textless}p{\textgreater}The COVID-19 pandemic is the first global health crisis to occur in the age of big genomic data. Although data generation capacity is well established and sufficiently standardized, analytical capacity is not. To establish analytical capacity it is necessary to pull together global computational resources and deliver the best open source tools and analysis workflows within a ready to use, universally accessible resource. Such a resource should not be controlled by a single research group, institution, or country. Instead it should be maintained by a community of users and developers who ensure that the system remains operational and populated with current tools. A community is also essential for facilitating the types of discourse needed to establish best analytical practices. Bringing together public computational research infrastructure from the USA, Europe, and Australia, we developed a distributed data analysis platform that accomplishes these goals. It is immediately accessible to anyone in the world and is designed for the analysis of rapidly growing collections of deep sequencing datasets. We demonstrate its utility by detecting allelic variants in high-quality existing SARS-CoV-2 sequencing datasets and by continuous reanalysis of COG-UK data.

@article{maki_inhibition_2025,
 abstract = {Escherichia coli O157:H7 is a major food safety concern through contamination of beef and produce. Non-antibiotic interventions to minimize O157:H7 in food animals and products are highly desired and one strategy to improve food safety is to reduce O157:H7 in cattle, a main asymptomatic reservoir, through probiotic administration. Non-pathogenic E. coli populating the intestine represent a compelling probiotic source, as these strains are already host-adapted. The challenge is to identify non-pathogenic strains capable of competing with O157:H7 for nutrients or those producing compounds to inhibit O157:H7 growth. Here, E. coli isolated from cattle fecal and recto-anal junction swab samples were sequenced and screened for the ability to compete with O157:H7. Fourteen genetically distinct, non-Shiga toxin-encoding, non-O157:H7 E. coli strains were recovered, and individual isolates representative of each strain were assessed. Nearly all strains possessed complete genetic pathways for the utilization of carbon and nitrogen sources required for O157:H7 colonization of the cattle intestine. Growth curve assays were conducted, and growth metrics were compared between bovine non-O157:H7 E. coli isolates and two O157:H7 isolates. While no strain outperformed both O157:H7 strains for all nutrients tested, at least one strain outperformed O157:H7 for each of the carbon sources tested. No strain grew significantly better than O157:H7 in media supplemented with ethanolamine. A "highly competitive" consortium of 4 non-O157:H7 isolates that grew significantly better than O157:H7 reduced O157:H7 counts CFU/mL by 1.53 log10 and {\textgreater}0.72 log10 under anaerobic and aerobic conditions, respectively, in competition assays. A consortium of "low-competitive" strains reduced O157:H7 counts by {\textgreater}0.47 log10 and {\textgreater}0.51 log10 under anaerobic and aerobic conditions. These results suggest that cattle harbor non-O157:H7 E. coli strains capable of limiting O157:H7 growth in vitro. Surveys of commensal non-O157:H7 isolates from cattle using growth-based phenotypic assays may be useful in identifying E. coli strains capable of outcompeting O157:H7 in the bovine intestine for further in vivo testing as probiotics.},

 abstract = {Campylobacter ureolyticus is an emerging pathogen increasingly appreciated as a common cause of gastroenteritis and extra-intestinal infections in humans. Outside the setting of gastroenteritis, little work has been done to describe the genomic content and relatedness of the species, especially regarding clinical isolates. We reviewed the epidemiology of clinical C. ureolyticus cultured by our institution over the past 10 years. Fifty-one unique C. ureolyticus isolates were identified between January 2010 and August 2022, mostly originating from abscesses and blood cultures. To clarify the taxonomic relationships between isolates and to attribute specific genes with different clinical manifestations, we sequenced 19 available isolates from a variety of clinical specimen types and conducted a pangenomic analysis with publicly available C. ureolyticus genomes. Digital DNA:DNA hybridization suggested that these C. ureolyticus comprised a species complex of 10 species clusters (SCs) and several subspecies clusters. Although some orthologous genes or gene functions were enriched in isolates found in different SCs and clinical specimens, no association was significant. Nearly a third of the isolates possessed antimicrobial resistance genes, including the ermA resistance gene, potentially conferring resistance to macrolides, the treatment of choice for severe human campylobacteriosis. This work effectively doubles the number of publicly available C. ureolyticus genomes, provides further clarification of taxonomic relationships within this bacterial complex, and identifies target SCs for future analysis.},

Yet its bioavailable forms are scarce. Phytate, a major form of stored phosphorus in cereals and soils, is poorly bioavailable due to its complex structure. Phytases, enzymes that hydrolyze phytate to release useable phosphorus, are vital in overcoming this limitation and have significant biotechnological applications. This study employed novel method to isolate and characterize bacterial strains capable of metabolizing phytate as the sole carbon and phosphorus source from the Andes mountains soils. Ten strains from the genera {\textless}italic{\textgreater}Klebsiella{\textless}/italic{\textgreater} and Chryseobacterium were isolated, with {\textless}italic{\textgreater}Chryseobacterium{\textless}/italic{\textgreater} sp. CP-77 and {\textless}italic{\textgreater}Klebsiella pneumoniae{\textless}/italic{\textgreater} CP-84 showing specific activities of 3.5 ± 0.4 nkat/mg and 40.8 ± 5 nkat/mg, respectively. Genomic sequencing revealed significant genetic diversity, suggesting CP-77 may represent a novel {\textless}italic{\textgreater}Chryseobacterium{\textless}/italic{\textgreater} species. A fosmid library screening identified several phytase genes, including a 3-phytase in CP-77 and a glucose 1-phosphatase and 3-phytase in CP-84. Phylogenetic analysis confirmed the novelty of these enzymes. These findings highlight the potential of phytase-producing bacteria in sustainable agriculture by enhancing phosphorus bioavailability, reducing reliance on synthetic fertilizers, and contributing to environmental management. This study expands our biotechnological toolkit for microbial phosphorus management and underscores the importance of exploring poorly characterized environments for novel microbial functions. The integration of direct cultivation with metagenomic screening offers robust approaches for discovering microbial biocatalysts, promoting sustainable agricultural practices, and advancing environmental conservation.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

 abstract = {The genus Peltigera includes terricolous and muscicolous foliose macrolichens that are common and widespread across the majority of continents. The genus is well-defined by the absence of a lower cortex and the presence of a dense arachnoid-tomentose pilema that usually bears anastomosing pale or dark veins with numerous solitary or confluent rhizines. However, the high morphological similarity among its species poses significant taxonomic challenges for accurate identification, often necessitating the use of molecular data. This study presents a comprehensive mitogenomic analysis of 11 Peltigera species, with the aim of elucidating their genetic structure and taxonomic status. We sequenced and performed de novo assembly of the complete mitochondrial genomes, followed by comprehensive genomic analysis. This analysis revealed that the circular genome length ranged in length from 52,107 bp to 76,353 bp with guanine and cytosine (GC) contents between 26.4 and 27.4\%. The mitogenomes encoded 15 protein-coding genes (PCGs), 26–27 transfer RNAs (tRNAs), and 2 ribosomal RNAs (rRNAs). Our analysis revealed a variety of scattered repeats, simple repeats, and tandem repeats, predominantly in intergenic and intron regions. Additionally, we examined codon usage and conducted a synteny analysis within the mitogenomes of Peltigera species. These findings enhance our understanding of the genetic evolution and phylogenetic relationships within Peltigera, providing a scientific foundation for future research on the diversity and evolution of lichenized fungi.},

In pre-monsoon of 2022 (June), sediment cores and surface water were collected as well as in situ environmental parameters were measured from two pre-designated sampling points of Sundarbans to elucidate the benthic foraminifera community based on sediment eDNA approach. Based on Oxford Nanopore Technologies (ONT) sequencing in MinION platform, high abundance of Sorites sp., Elphidium excavatum, Textularia gramen, Quinqueloculina sp. and Trochammina hadai were detected. The increasing nutrient concentrations and elucidated benthic foraminiferal signals can contribute towards tracking the state of ecological health of Sundarbans.

 abstract = {Contractile vacuoles (CVs), enigmatic osmoregulatory organelles, share common characteristics, such as a requirement for RAB11 and high levels of V-ATPase. These commonalities suggest a conserved evolutionary origin for the CVs with implications for understanding of the last common ancestor of eukaryotes and eukaryotic diversification more broadly. A taxonomically broader sampling of CV-associated machinery is required to address this question further. We used a transcriptomics-based approach to identify CV-associated gene products in Dictyostelium discoideum. This approach was first validated by assessing a set of known CV-associated gene products, which were significantly upregulated following hypo-osmotic exposure. Moreover, endosomal and vacuolar gene products were enriched in the upregulated gene set. An upregulated SNARE protein (NPSNB) was predominantly plasma membrane localised and enriched in the vicinity of CVs, supporting the association with this organelle found in the transcriptomic analysis. We therefore confirm that transcriptomic approaches can identify known and novel players in CV function, in our case emphasizing the role of endosomal vesicle fusion machinery in the D. discoideum CV and facilitating future work to address questions regarding the deep evolution of eukaryotic organelles.},

 abstract = {Background On 15 January 2024, the Ministry of Health (MOH) reported a notable outbreak of acute viral conjunctivitis in the city of Dar es Salaam. In this study we investigated the causative agent of acute conjunctivitis outbreak which occurred in Dar es Salaam between Jan 2024 and Feb 2024.
Methodology We conveniently collected a pair of eye swab samples from twenty-five patients presenting with symptoms of acute conjunctivitis at clinics in Dar es Salaam during the outbreak. One for bacterial culture and another for molecular detection. MacConkey and Blood agar were used to culture patient samples to identify possible bacterial causes. A Multiplex Real-time RT-PCR targeting Adenovirus, Metapneumovirus, Human Enterovirus and Parainfluenza. Positive samples with Ct value less than 30 for enterovirus were subjected to genomic sequencing by Illumina Miseq after library preparation and enrichment by Illumina’s Respiratory Pathogen ID/AMR enrichment panel kit as per manufacturer’s instructions (RPIP kit), followed by bioinformatics and phylogenetic analysis.
Results Out of 25 samples, nine samples were positive for human enterovirus by Real-time PCR. Of the nine positive samples four were sequenced and Coxsackievirus A24 variant, was identified as the most probable cause of the outbreak. Phylogenetic analysis showed that samples collected during the outbreak (28AO and 26HB) belong to a clade with Coxsackievirus A24 sequences from France Mayotte from a 2024 outbreak, also close to sequences from neighbouring East African countries (Uganda, Kenya) as well as South American countries (Brazil, Mexico, and French Guiana).
Conclusion This study demonstrated the utility of genomic epidemiology in identifying Coxsackievirus A24 as the pathogen responsible for the outbreak and its circulation within the East African region.

@article{marco_dorq-seq_2024,
 abstract = {Due to its high modification content tRNAs are notoriously hard to quantify by reverse transcription and RNAseq. Bypassing numerous biases resulting from concatenation of enzymatic treatments, we here report a hybrid approach that harnesses the advantages of hybridization-based and deep sequencing–based approaches. The method renders obsolete any RNAseq related workarounds and correction factors that affect accuracy, sensitivity, and turnaround time. Rather than by reverse transcription, quantitative information on the isoacceptor composition of a tRNA pool is transferred to a cDNA mixture in a single step procedure, thereby omitting all enzymatic conversations except for the subsequent barcoding PCR. As a result, a detailed tRNA composition matrix can be obtained from femtomolar amounts of total tRNA. The method is fast, low in cost, and its bioinformatic data workup surprisingly simple. These properties make the approach amenable to high-throughput investigations including clinical samples, as we have demonstrated by application to a collection of variegated biological questions, each answered with novel findings. These include tRNA pool quantification of polysome-bound tRNA, of tRNA modification knockout strains under stress conditions, and of Alzheimer patients’ brain tissues.},

@article{maree_trypanosoma_2022,
 abstract = {Trypanosomes diverged from the main eukaryotic lineage about 600 million years ago, and display some unusual genomic and epigenetic properties that provide valuable insight into the early processes employed by eukaryotic ancestors to regulate chromatin-mediated functions. We analysed Trypanosoma brucei core histones by high mass accuracy middle-down mass spectrometry to map core histone post-translational modifications (PTMs) and elucidate cis-histone combinatorial PTMs (cPTMs). T. brucei histones are heavily modified and display intricate cPTMs patterns, with numerous hypermodified cPTMs that could contribute to the formation of non-repressive euchromatic states. The Trypanosoma brucei H2A C-terminal tail is hyperacetylated, containing up to five acetylated lysine residues. MNase-ChIP-seq revealed a striking enrichment of hyperacetylated H2A at Pol II transcription start regions, and showed that H2A histones that are hyperacetylated in different combinations localised to different genomic regions, suggesting distinct epigenetic functions. Our genomics and proteomics data provide insight into the complex epigenetic mechanisms used by this parasite to regulate a genome that lacks the transcriptional control mechanisms found in later-branched eukaryotes. The findings further demonstrate the complexity of epigenetic mechanisms that were probably shared with the last eukaryotic common ancestor.},

@article{mariduena-zavala_babaco_2025,
 abstract = {The recent emergence of Babacco Mosaic Virus (BabMV), a potexvirus known to infect Vasconcellea heilbornii (babaco), has raised concerns about its potential to infect papaya cultivars. To assess the impact of BabMV on papaya plants, we conducted a comprehensive genome-wide transcriptome analysis to evaluate the effect of the virus on gene expression and defense responses in Papaya (Carica papaya). Leaves from papaya plants of 3–4-month-old plants were examined at 2, 10, 15, and 30 days post-infection (dpi) with BabMV and compared to uninfected controls. In mock and virus-infected plants at 2 and 10 dpi, more than 90\% of the RNAseq reads were mapped with the papaya genome. In contrast, at 15 and 30 dpi, only 31\% mapped to the papaya genome in BabMV-infected leaves, while the remaining 69\% of the reads aligned to the virus genome, demonstrating a high viral load. Overall, 1585 papaya genes were differentially expressed between mock and BabMV-inoculated leaves. At 2–10 dpi, early responses included increased expression of genes related to sugar metabolism and cell wall modification, including lignin synthesis. At 30 dpi, late responses included the induction of genes involved in reactive oxygen species (ROS) production and antioxidants, potentially via cytochrome P450 enzyme activation. This explained the upregulation of Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinases (MAPK3,18) and transcription factors including WRKY40,60,70 and Ethylene Response Factor 1 (ERF1), known to induce the expression of genes encoding pathogenesis-related proteins (PR1) and activating the plant defense mechanisms. This research enhances our understanding of BabMV infections, enabling the development of effective strategies for disease control.},

@article{marimon_pertussis_2024,
 abstract = {Background: Pertussis has re-emerged in many countries despite the wide use of vaccines for over 60 years. During 2023, we observed an increase in the incidence of pertussis in Gipuzkoa, north of Spain (with a population of 657,140 inhabitants), mainly affecting children between 11 and 15 years of age. Methods: This study included all confirmed cases diagnosed by PCR in nasopharyngeal swab samples. The genome of seven isolates collected in 2023 was sequenced. Results: Between 2018 and 2023, 884 cases of whooping cough were diagnosed. Pertussis incidence (in cases per 100,000 inhabitants) decreased from 36.7 in 2018 to no cases in 2021, increasing again to 56.8 in 2023. In 2023, the age group of 11–15 years old had the highest incidence rate of 409.3. Only 2 of the 56 children {\textless} 6 years old required hospitalization, and there were no deaths. The seven isolates collected in 2023 showed the same BPagST-4 (ptxA1/ptxP3/prn2/fim2-1/fim3-1 allelic combination), with all of them expressing the pertactin antigen. Conclusions: Immunity waning after the last dose of vaccination at 6 years old, together with the lack of circulation of Bordetella pertussis during the COVID-19 pandemic, were probably the main reasons for the high increase in the incidence of pertussis in Gipuzkoa in 2023.},

 abstract = {\textbf{Background}: The aging of the population has increased the number of frail people living in long-term care facilities, underscoring the need for continuous updates in infectious diseases prevention strategies. The aim of this study was to analyze two pneumococcal disease outbreaks in elderly residences in Gipuzkoa, northern Spain, their impact on residents, and the containment measures implemented. \textbf{Material and methods}: The outbreaks took place in 2023 and in 2024 in two residences of 111 and of 155 residents, respectively. Diagnosis was based on clinical criteria, radiological findings, and microbiological techniques. Pneumococcal isolates were characterized by whole-genome sequencing. \textbf{Results}: The outbreaks involved five and six residents, respectively. Most residents in both facilities had been vaccinated with the pneumococcal polysaccharide 23-valent vaccine (PPV23) more than five years prior. The median attack rates were 4.5\% and 3.9\%, lower than those reported in similar outbreaks. The adopted infection transmission prevention measures successfully limited the spread of the outbreaks. \textbf{Conclusions}: PPV23 vaccination did not prevent invasive pneumococcal infection in the affected residents. The vaccination of elderly people living in long-term care facilities with 20-valent and 21-valent pneumococcal conjugated vaccines should be evaluated as a new preventive measure.},

The assembled transcriptome comprised 37,117 protein-coding transcripts, of which 13,633 full-length ({\textgreater}80\% coverage), with an Ex90N50 of 3061 bp and 76\% of complete and single-copy core vertebrate genes orthologues. Of these transcripts, 34,980 had a hit against the EggNOG database and 14,983 with the KEGG database. Codon usage bias was identified in processes such as translation and muscle development. By comparing our data with a set of representative fish species, 87.1\% of tuna transcripts were included in orthogroups with other species and 5.1\% in assembly-specific orthogroups, which were enriched in terms related to muscle and bone development, visual system and ion transport. Following this comparative approach, protein families related to myosin, extracellular matrix and immune system resulted significantly expanded in the Atlantic bluefin tuna. Altogether, these results provide a glimpse of how the Atlantic bluefin tuna might have achieved early physical advantages over competing species in the pelagic environment. The information generated lays the foundation for future research on the more detailed exploration of physiological responses at the molecular level in different larval stages and paves the way to evolutionary studies on the Atlantic bluefin tuna.},

Due to ELIXIR’s pan-European distributed nature, ownership of indicators is also distributed - this means that the resulting temporal scopes are also quite varied. Some evidence relates to ‘impact’ (i.e. in the infrastructure’s sphere of \textit{interest}) whilst other to ‘performance’ (i.e. the spheres of \textit{control} and \textit{influence}), and there is not always a clear boundary between the two.

 abstract = {Despite the reported low expression of the primary SARS-CoV-2 receptor ACE2 in distinct ocular tissues, some clinical evidence suggests that SARS-CoV-2 can infect the eye. In this study, we explored potential entry sites for SARS-CoV-2 by viral S protein histochemistry on various ocular tissues and compared the staining patterns with RNA and protein expression of TMPRSS2 and ACE2. Potential viral entry sites were investigated by histochemistry using tagged recombinant viral S protein on 52 ocular tissue samples including specimens of the cornea, conjunctiva, lid margin, lacrimal gland tissue, retina, choroid, and RPE. In addition, ACE2 and TMPRSS2 immunohistochemistry were performed on the same ocular tissue, each with distinct antibodies binding to different epitopes. Lung tissue samples were used as positive controls. Finally, bulk RNA sequencing (RNA-Seq) was used to determine the expression of ACE2 and its auxiliary factors in the tissues mentioned above. S protein histochemistry revealed a positive staining in lung tissue but absent staining in the cornea, the conjunctiva, eye lid samples, the lacrimal glands, the retina and the optic nerve which was supported by hardly any immunoreactivity for ACE2 and TMPRSS2 and scarce ACE2 and TMPRSS2 RNA expression. Negligible staining with antibodies targeting ACE2 or TMPRSS2 was seen in the main and accessory lacrimal glands. In contrast, ocular staining (S protein, ACE2, TMPRSS2) was distinctly present in pigmented cells of the RPE and choroid, as well as in the ciliary body and the iris stroma. S protein histochemistry revealed hardly any SARS-CoV-2 entry sites in all ocular tissues examined. Similarly, no significant ACE2 or TMPRSS2 expression was found in extra- and intraocular tissue. While this study suggest a rather low risk of ocular infection with SARS-CoV-2, it should be noted, that potential viral entry sites may increase in response to inflammation or in certain disease states.},

Elles sont associées à un ensemble de signes cliniques dont certains sont déclenchés ou exacerbés par la présence de micro-organismes dans la sphère respiratoire de l’animal. Les bactéries du genre Mycoplasma, atypiques par leurs caractéristiques phénotypiques et génomiques, ont été décrites comme associées à des infections respiratoires à l'échelle mondiale, tant chez l’homme que les animaux d'élevage. Elles sont retrouvées avec une prévalence proche de 15 \% dans les lavages respiratoires équins reçus pour diagnostic sans que leur rôle clinique ne soit clairement défini. Pour comprendre le rôle de ces bactéries, un protocole mixte, associant culture et amplification génique à partir d’un enrichissement sur bouillon du prélèvement initial, a été validé. Cette méthode a été utilisée sur 1948 échantillons de 1764 chevaux, reçus sur la période 2020-2022. La prévalence des bactéries du genre Mycoplasma a été affinée à 16,1\% avec une prédominance de l’espèce M. equirhinis (85,3\%). La détection de M. equirhinis n’a pas pu être associée à des signes cliniques rapportés par les vétérinaires. Toutefois, une détection plus importante chez les chevaux de races de course et ceux vivant en box, dans les lavages trachéaux, a été mise en évidence. Dans les liquides bronchoalvéolaires, M. equirhinis a été identifié de façon concomitante à une inflammation à médiation neutrophilique. La prévalence de M. equirhinis est augmentée en présence d’autres micro-organismes tels que Streptococcus zooepidemicus, EHV-5 et Actinobacillus equuli. L’analyse des génomes de diverses souches de M. equirhinis montre une homogénéité importante de l’espèce malgré la présence d’éléments génétiques mobiles. Les gènes associés à la virulence retrouvés sont caractéristiques du genre Mycoplasma et très similaires à ceux détectés dans l’espèce M. hominis, un pathogène opportuniste de la sphère génitale chez l’homme, phylogénétiquement très proche de M. equirhinis. Tous ces éléments conduisent donc à considérer M. equirhinis comme un agent opportuniste au sein d’un complexe respiratoire équin, qu’il s’agira de caractériser plus finement par sa détection quantitative dans les prélèvements initiaux et l’analyse plus global du microbiote respiratoire.},

Type I restriction-modification (RM) systems recognize specific DNA motifs and degrade unmethylated foreign DNA, restricting phage replication. In this study, we detected that Marinomonas mediterranea MMB-2 uses a Type I RM system (Mme2I) to protect against several new phages in the Murciavirus genus within the Autographiviridae family. Whole-genome sequencing and methylation analysis revealed a DNA sequence motif methylated in M. mediterranea MMB-2, which is also present in the phages. Phages lacking the motif within the leading, first injected, region of their genomes, either natural isolates or escape mutants of sensitive phages, successfully infect M. mediterranea MMB-2, despite the presence of the recognition motif elsewhere in their genomes. These results highlight the importance of considering RM motif locations when predicting avoidance of restriction sites as escape mechanisms from RM systems. Additionally, our findings indicate an important role for RM systems in specifically influencing the organization of the leading injected regions of phage genomes, which are highly variable and often encode diverse anti-defence systems.},

This change causes a reduction in the affinity of the catalytic domain for the H3 tail and in the activity of the enzyme by three- to five-fold. DNA methylation, histone methylation and gene expression profiles suggest a significant overlap between the EHMT2 p.Ala1077Ser variant and KS. Based on this evidence we suggest that EHMT2 haploinsufficiency causes a Kleefstra-like syndrome. Although we cannot rule out dominant negative effects caused by the EHMT2 p.Ala1077Ser variant, our data and previously published data suggest that loss of EHMT2 function is probably more detrimental to cells than loss of EHMT1, explaining why individuals with alterations in EHMT2 are very rare.},

 abstract = {Cytokines are highly pleiotropic ligands that regulate the immune response. Here, using interleukin-6 (IL-6) as a model system, we perform detailed phosphoproteomic and transcriptomic studies in human CD4+ T helper 1 (Th-1) cells to address the molecular bases defining cytokine functional pleiotropy. We identify CDK8 as a negative regulator of STAT3 transcriptional activities, which interacts with STAT3 upon IL-6 stimulation. Inhibition of CDK8 activity, using specific small molecule inhibitors, reduces the IL-6-induced phosphoproteome by 23\% in Th-1 cells, including STAT3 S727 phosphorylation. STAT3 binding to target DNA sites in the genome is increased upon CDK8 inhibition, which results in a concomitant increase in STAT3-mediated transcriptional activity. Importantly, inhibition of CDK8 activity under Th-17 polarizing conditions results in an enhancement of Th-17 differentiation. Our results support a model where CDK8 regulates STAT3 transcriptional processivity by modulation of its gene loci resident time, critically contributing to diversification of IL-6 responses.},

 abstract = {LAMA2, coding for the laminin-α2 chain, is a crucial ECM component, particularly abundant in skeletal muscle. Mutations in LAMA2 trigger the often-lethal LAMA2-congenital muscular dystrophy (LAMA2-CMD). Various phenotypes have been linked to LAMA2-CMD; nevertheless, the precise mechanisms that malfunction during disease onset in utero remain unknown. We generated Lama2-deficient C2C12 cells and found that Lama2-deficient myoblasts display proliferation, differentiation, and fusion defects, DNA damage, oxidative stress, and mitochondrial dysfunction. Moreover, fetal myoblasts isolated from the dyW mouse model of LAMA2-CMD display impaired differentiation and fusion in vitro. We also showed that disease onset during fetal development is characterized by a significant down-regulation of gene expression in muscle fibers, causing pronounced effects on cytoskeletal organization, muscle differentiation, and altered DNA repair and oxidative stress responses. Together, our findings provide unique insights into the critical importance of the laminin-α2 chain for muscle differentiation and muscle cell homeostasis.

 abstract = {The predator Asian hornet (Vespa velutina) represents one of the major threats to honeybee survival. Viral spillover from bee to wasp has been supposed in several studies, and this work aims to identify and study the virome of both insect species living simultaneously in the same foraging area. Transcriptomic analysis was performed on V. velutina and Apis mellifera samples, and replicative form of detected viruses was carried out by strand-specific RT-PCR. Overall, 6 and 9 different viral types were reported in V. velutina and A. mellifera, respectively, and five of these viruses were recorded in both hosts. Varroa destructor virus-1 and Cripavirus NB-1/2011/HUN (now classified as Triato-like virus) were the most represented viruses detected in both hosts, also in replicative form. In this investigation, Triato-like virus, as well as Aphis gossypii virus and Nora virus, was detected for the first time in honeybees. Concerning V. velutina, we report for the first time the recently detected honeybee La Jolla virus. A general high homology rate between genomes of shared viruses between V. velutina and A. mellifera suggests the efficient transmission of the virus from bee to wasp. In conclusion, our findings highlight the presence of several known and newly reported RNA viruses infecting A. mellifera and V. velutina. This confirms the environment role as an important source of infection and indicates the possibility of spillover from prey to predator.},

 abstract = {Colorectal cancer (CRC) is a serious public health problem known to have a multifactorial etiology. The association between gut microbiota and CRC has been widely studied; however, the link between archaea and CRC has not been sufficiently studied. To investigate the involvement of archaea in colorectal carcinogenesis, we performed a metagenomic analysis of 68 formalin-embedded paraffin fixed tissues from tumoral (n = 33) and healthy mucosa (n = 35) collected from 35 CRC Tunisian patients. We used two DNA extraction methods: Generead DNA FFPE kit (Qiagen, Germantown, MD, USA) and Chelex. We then sequenced the samples using Illumina Miseq. Interestingly, DNA extraction exclusively using Chelex generated enough DNA for sequencing of all samples. After data filtering and processing, we reported the presence of archaeal sequences, which represented 0.33\% of all the reads generated. In terms of abundance, we highlighted a depletion in methanogens and an enrichment in Halobacteria in the tumor tissues, while the correlation analysis revealed a significant association between the Halobacteria and the tumor mucosa (p {\textless} 0.05). We reported a strong correlation between Natrialba magadii, Sulfolobus acidocaldarius, and tumor tissues, and a weak correlation between Methanococcus voltae and healthy adjacent mucosa. Here, we demonstrated the feasibility of archaeome analysis from formol fixed paraffin-embedded (FFPE) tissues using simple protocols ranging from sampling to data analysis, and reported a significant association between Halobacteria and tumor tissues in Tunisian patients with CRC. The importance of our study is that it represents the first metagenomic analysis of Tunisian CRC patients’ gut microbiome, which consists of sequencing DNA extracted from paired tumor-adjacent FFPE tissues collected from CRC patients. The detection of archaeal sequences in our samples confirms the feasibility of carrying out an archaeome analysis from FFPE tissues using a simple DNA extraction protocol. Our analysis revealed the enrichment of Halobacteria, especially Natrialba magadii, in tumor mucosa compared to the normal mucosa in CRC Tunisian patients. Other species were also associated with CRC, including Sulfolobus acidocaldarius and Methanococcus voltae, which is a methanogenic archaea; both species were found to be correlated with adjacent healthy tissues.},

 abstract = {Abscisic acid (ABA) signaling in plants is essential to several aspects of plant development, such as tolerance to environmental stresses and growth. ABA signaling is also important for storage organ formation in crops, such as sweet potato. However, the repertoire of I. batatas ABA signaling gene families has not yet been fully characterized, so that it is unclear which members of these families are necessary for tuberization. Therefore, genome-wide identification of the sweet potato ABF/ AREB/ ABI5, SnRK2, and PYL gene families was performed, along with phylogenetic, motif, cis-regulatory element (CRE), and expression analyses. Nine ABF, eight SnRK2, and eleven PYL gene family members were identified, and there was high sequence conservation among these proteins that were revealed by phylogenetic and motif analyses. The promoter sequences of these genes had multiple CREs that were involved in hormone responses and stress responses. In silico and qRT-PCR expression analyses revealed that these genes were expressed in various tissues and that IbABF3, IbABF4, IbDPBF3, IbDPBF4, IbPYL4, IbSnRK2.1, and IbSnRK2.2 were significantly expressed during storage root development. These results are an important reference that can be used for functional validation studies to better understand how ABA signaling elicits storage root formation at the molecular level.},

 abstract = {Auxin is a plant phytohormone that is essential for the initiation of tuberization in sweet potato (Ipomoea batatas (L.) Lam.). Auxin exerts these effects via polar auxin transport facilitated by various auxin influx and efflux carriers. It is unclear which members of the auxin transporter families: PIN, PILS, Aux/LAX, and ABCB, are involved in sweet potato tuber initiation and development. Therefore, a genome-wide analysis of the I. batatas auxin transporter genes was conducted, and their expression patterns during storage root initiation and development were analyzed. Five IbLAX, 16 IbPIN, 12 IbPILS, and 34 IbABCB family members were identified. These genes showed high conservation among families based on their intron-exon structure, motif composition, and phylogenetic analysis. Additionally, the promoter regions of these genes had various cis-acting regulatory elements involved in hormone, light, and developmental responses. The auxin transporter genes were expressed in various sweet potato tissues, and many were differentially expressed during storage root development. IbLAX1, IbPIN13, IbPILS7, IbABCB1, and IbABCB14 showed up-regulated expression during tuber initiation. This study characterizes these auxin transporter gene families for the first time. These results are an important reference for validation studies to determine the specific functions of these genes and their auxin transporting capability.},

 abstract = {MicroRNAs (miRNAs) regulate a wide variety of biological processes by silencing their target genes. Argonaute (AGO) proteins load miRNAs to form an RNA-induced silencing complex (RISC), which mediates translational repression and/or mRNA decay of the targets. A scaffold protein called GW182 directly binds AGO and the CCR4-NOT deadenylase complex, initiating the mRNA decay reaction. Although previous studies have demonstrated the critical role of GW182 in cultured cells as well as in cell-free systems, its biological significance in living organisms remains poorly explored, especially in Drosophila melanogaster. Here, we generated gw182-null flies using the CRISPR/Cas9 system and found that, unexpectedly, they can survive until an early second-instar larval stage. Moreover, in vivo miRNA reporters can be effectively repressed in gw182-null first-instar larvae. Nevertheless, gw182-null flies have defects in the expression of chitin-related genes and the formation of the larval trachea system, preventing them from completing larval development. Our results highlight the importance of both GW182-dependent and -independent silencing mechanisms in vivo.},

 abstract = {Background: Breast cancer is the most frequent malignancy affecting women worldwide. The majority of breast cancer occurs sporadically, with only 5-10\% being caused by inheritance of susceptibility genes. In Brunei Darussalam, breast cancer is the leading cause of cancer in women. The prevalence and clinical relevance of breast cancer susceptibility genes in Brunei breast cancer patients is unknown. We investigated the prevalence and clinical relevance of germline TP53 and PALB2 genes, recognised to confer a high and moderate risk respectively, in the development of breast cancer in an unselected cohort of Brunei breast cancer patients. Methods: Genomic DNA was extracted from peripheral blood samples of 54 unselected Brunei breast cancer patients. The DNA samples were sequenced for germline BRCA1, BRCA2, TP53, and PALB2 variants using targeted panel sequencing on a Hi-Plex NGS platform. Identified variants were analysed for their pathogenicity classification based on clinical/population/mutation databases, in-silico data, and available functional data analysis. Chi-square test was used to determine the association between TP53 codon 72 and response to chemotherapy in Brunei breast cancer patients. Results: We identified two TP53 and five PALB2 missense variants in our study population. Five of the identified variants were classified as variants of uncertain significance (one in TP53 and four in PALB2 ) giving a prevalence of TP53 and PALB2 variant of uncertain significance carriers at 1.9\% and 9.3\%, respectively. No pathogenic TP53 and PALB2 mutation was identified in this study suggesting the rarity of these genes in breast cancer. TP53 codon 72 had no association with Brunei breast cancer patients’ response to chemotherapy supporting the benign characteristic of the variant P72R. Conclusions: Our current findings suggest that the contribution of germline TP53 and PALB2 genes in unselected Brunei breast cancer patients is rare, and a larger number of participants will be required to confirm this finding.},

BRCA1 and BRCA2 genes are the most well-known and well described predictors of hereditary breast cancer due to their clinical importance. This study aimed to identify the prevalence and mutation spectrum of the BRCA1 and BRCA2 germline mutations among 120 unselected series of Brunei breast cancer patients. We screened the entire coding region of BRCA1 and BRCA2 gene using Sanger sequencing and next-generation sequencing methods and identified three pathogenic and one likely pathogenic mutations in the BRCA2 gene. Of the 120 patients, 6 (5\%) were BRCA2 carriers which confirm that BRCA2 carriers are more common in the Asian population compared to the Caucasian population. One BRCA2 mutation observed only in the Chinese ethnicity of the Brunei breast cancer population suggest a probability of the mutation being a founder effect in the Southern Chinese population. Brunei BRCA2 carriers were more likely to have a positive family history of breast and/or ovarian cancers and have more than one family members in the first-degree relatives diagnosed with breast cancer.},

 abstract = {{\textless}h4{\textgreater}Background{\textless}/h4{\textgreater}Seisonidea (also Seisonacea or Seisonidae) is a group of small animals living on marine crustaceans (Nebalia spec.) with only four species described so far. Its monophyletic origin with mostly free-living wheel animals (Monogononta, Bdelloidea) and endoparasitic thorny-headed worms (Acanthocephala) is widely accepted. However, the phylogenetic relationships inside the Rotifera-Acanthocephala clade (Rotifera sensu lato or Syndermata) are subject to ongoing debate, with consequences for our understanding of how genomes and lifestyles might have evolved. To gain new insights, we analyzed first drafts of the genome and transcriptome of the key taxon Seisonidea.{\textless}h4{\textgreater}Results{\textless}/h4{\textgreater}Analyses of gDNA-Seq and mRNA-Seq data uncovered two genetically distinct lineages in Seison nebaliae Grube, 1861 off the French Channel coast. Their mitochondrial haplotypes shared only 82\% sequence identity despite identical gene order. In the nuclear genome, distinct linages were reflected in different gene compactness, GC content and codon usage. The haploid nuclear genome spans ca. 46 Mb, of which 96\% were reconstructed. According to {\textasciitilde} 23,000 SuperTranscripts, gene number in S. nebaliae should be within the range published for other members of Rotifera-Acanthocephala. Consistent with this, numbers of metazoan core orthologues and ANTP-type transcriptional regulatory genes in the S. nebaliae genome assembly were between the corresponding numbers in the other assemblies analyzed. We additionally provide evidence that a basal branching of Seisonidea within Rotifera-Acanthocephala could reflect attraction to the outgroup. Accordingly, rooting via a reconstructed ancestral sequence led to monophyletic Pararotatoria (Seisonidea+Acanthocephala) within Hemirotifera (Bdelloidea+Pararotatoria).{\textless}h4{\textgreater}Conclusion{\textless}/h4{\textgreater}Matching genome/transcriptome metrics with the above phylogenetic hypothesis suggests that a haploid nuclear genome of about 50 Mb represents the plesiomorphic state for Rotifera-Acanthocephala. Smaller genome size in S. nebaliae probably results from subsequent reduction. In contrast, genome size should have increased independently in monogononts as well as bdelloid and acanthocephalan stem lines. The present data additionally indicate a decrease in gene repertoire from free-living to epizoic and endoparasitic lifestyles. Potentially, this reflects corresponding steps from the root of Rotifera-Acanthocephala via the last common ancestors of Hemirotifera and Pararotatoria to the one of Acanthocephala. Lastly, rooting via a reconstructed ancestral sequence may prove useful in phylogenetic analyses of other deep splits.},

 abstract = {BackgroundProtein kinase CK2 is known to exist as a tetramer of two catalytic α- or α'- subunits and two non-catalytic β-subunits, or as multimers of this tetramer. Moreover, CK2α (CSNK2A1) and CK2α' (CSNK2A2) are also active in the absence of CK2β (CSNK2B). Very little is known about specific functions of the individual subunits of protein kinase CK2.ResultsIn order to study the effects of CK2α and CK2α' on gene expression, we used the Mus musculus pancreatic α-cell line αTC1 and two derivatives with either CK2α (KO1 cells) or CK2α' (KO2 cells) expression knocked-out by CRISPR/Cas technology. We found numerous genes deregulated in both KO1 and KO2 cells compared to the parental cells. Applying stringent thresholds, 266 genes were found down-regulated and 153 genes up-regulated in KO1 cells, 233 genes were found down-regulated and 84 genes up-regulated in KO2 cells. Dozens of genes were found deregulated in a similar fashion in both KO1 and KO2 cells. We found altered expression of genes involved in the differentiation of pancreatic cells, including Hox genes, and in the regulation of glucagon synthesis or secretion. Moreover, many of the deregulated genes play an important role in developmental processes and in neuronal cell biology.ConclusionOur findings reveal individual and shared functions of the CK2α and CK2α' catalytic subunits, in particular regarding their involvement in regulating gene expression.},

 abstract = {A global genome database of all of Earth's species diversity could be a treasure trove of scientific discoveries. However, regardless of the major advances in genome sequencing technologies, only a tiny fraction of species have genomic information available. To contribute to a more complete planetary genomic database, scientists and institutions across the world have united under the Earth BioGenome Project (EBP), which plans to sequence and assemble high-quality reference genomes for all {\textasciitilde}1.5 million recognized eukaryotic species through a stepwise phased approach. As the initiative transitions into Phase II, where 150,000 species are to be sequenced in just four years, worldwide participation in the project will be fundamental to success. As the European node of the EBP, the European Reference Genome Atlas (ERGA) seeks to implement a new decentralised, accessible, equitable and inclusive model for producing high-quality reference genomes, which will inform EBP as it scales. To embark on this mission, ERGA launched a Pilot Project to establish a network across Europe to develop and test the first infrastructure of its kind for the coordinated and distributed reference genome production on 98 European eukaryotic species from sample providers across 34 European countries. Here we outline the process and challenges faced during the development of a pilot infrastructure for the production of reference genome resources, and explore the effectiveness of this approach in terms of high-quality reference genome production, considering also equity and inclusion. The outcomes and lessons learned during this pilot provide a solid foundation for ERGA while offering key learnings to other transnational and national genomic resource projects.},

However, the epigenetics of AMs development and function in IPF are limited. Here, we characterised the DNA-methylation (DNAm) profile of AMs from IPF (n=30) and healthy (n=14) donors. Our analysis revealed epigenetic heterogeneity was a key characteristic of IPF AMs. DNAm ‘clock’ analysis indicated epigenetic alterations in IPF-AMs was not associated with accelerated ageing. In differential DNAm analysis, we identified numerous differentially methylated positions (DMPs, n=11) and regions (DMRs, n=49) between healthy and IPF AMs respectively. DMPs and DMRs encompassed genes involved in lipid (\textit{LPCAT1}) and glucose (\textit{PFKB3}) metabolism and importantly, DNAm status was associated with disease severity in IPF. Collectively, our data identify that profound changes in the epigenome underpin the development and function of AMs in the IPF lung.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

 abstract = {Seminal fluid proteins (Sfps) are essential for reproductive success and evolve fast on average, possibly driven by post-copulatory sexual selection (PCSS) originating from sperm competition and cryptic female choice. Counterintuitively, however, the coding region only in few Sfps evolves adaptively. Hence, additional genomic and functional factors must play a role in Sfp evolution independent of the protein coding region. To shed light on drivers of Sfp evolution we focus on those Sfps predominantly expressed in male accessory glands of Drosophila to examine their evolution in the tissue which produces the majority of Sfps. Unlike the testis, the accessory glands are known to develop normally in hybrids, allowing us to control for cellular environment differences arising during speciation. Here, we identify hotspots of rapid evolution in accessory gland protein genes (Acp) promoters, driven by base changes and insertions/deletions (indels). We further show that changes in promoter sequences are accompanied by gene expression divergence among closely related species. Using hybrids, we demonstrate that species-specific expression divergence is maintained for some Acps, while others exhibit dominance of one allele. These results indicate that regulatory evolution, rather than genome background variation, drives Acp expression changes and promotes their rapid evolution.},

To identify genetic influences on VSMC behavior, we measured these traits and undertook genome-wide association studies in primary umbilical artery-derived VSMCs from {\textgreater}2000 individuals. Although there were no genome-wide significant associations for VSMC proliferation or migration, genetic variants at two genomic loci (7p15.3 and 7q32.3) showed highly significant associations with VSMC apoptosis (P = 1.95 × 10−13 and P = 7.47 × 10−9, respectively). The lead variant at the 7p51.3 locus was associated with increased expression of the GSDME and PALS2 genes in VSMCs. Knockdown of GSDME or PALS2 in VSMCs attenuated apoptotic cell death. A protein co-immunoprecipitation assay indicated that GSDME complexed with PALS2. PALS2 knockdown attenuated activated caspase-3 and GSDME fragmentation, whilst GSDME knockdown also reduced activated caspase-3. These findings provide new insights into the genetic regulation of VSMC apoptosis, with potential utility for therapeutic development.},

Foram utilizados dois substratos (Tropstrato e Vivatto) com diferentes efeitos nas plantas. A partir destas condições de plantio e após inoculação com Trichoderma, foram analisados os seguintes parâmetros em tomateiro:  emergência das mudas e crescimento das plantas e indução da resistência contra doenças causadas por Fusarium oxysporum e Botrytis cinerea. Para a eficácia do sequenciamento, foram testados 3 métodos de extração de DNA: CTAB-brometo de cetiltrimetilamônio, DNeasy Plant Mini kit -QIAGEN e Wizard Genomic DNA Purification kit-PROMEGA. A obtenção dos genomas completos dos isolados foi realizada por meio da tecnologia Oxford Nanopore -MinION (sequências longas) e a plataforma NextSeq-Illumina. Os resultados dos ensaios de promoção de crescimento demonstraram que as condições de plantio podem influenciar diretamente no efeito do Trichoderma nas plantas, podendo ser positivo ou negativo. O tratamento prévio do Trichoderma nas plantas de tomateiro não foi eficaz contra a fusariose, mas teve um efeito redutor contra o mofo cinzento. O antagonista também não causou um efeito positivo na emergência das mudas. O método CTAB foi o mais eficiente na extração do DNA dos isolados de Trichoderma, mantendo maior concentração e preservando a molécula. O sequenciamento híbrido com as duas plataformas foi eficiente na obtenção dos genomas completos, que apresentaram tamanhos e conteúdos gênicos semelhantes aos de outras espécies do mesmo gênero já sequenciadas.},

The study employed various computational methods, including molecular dynamics simulation molecular docking, density functional theory, and global chemical descriptors, to evaluate the interactions between the compounds and the target proteins. The docking results revealed that compounds 9, 11, 13, and ofloxacin exhibited binding affinities of −7.6, −7.9, −7.5, and −7.8 kcal mol−1, respectively, against peptide methionine sulfoxide reductase msrA/msrB (PDB: 3E0M). Ligand (11) showed better inhibition for methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus msrA/msrB enzyme. The complex of the 3E0M-ligand 11 remained highly stable across all tested temperatures (300, 305, 310, and 320 K). Principal Component Analysis (PCA) was employed to evaluate the behavior of the complex at various temperatures (300, 305, 310, and 320 K), demonstrating a total variance of 85\%. Convergence was confirmed by the eigenvector’s cosine content value of 0.43, consistently displaying low RMSD values, with the minimum observed at 310 K. Furthermore, ligand 11 emerges as the most promising candidate among the compounds examined, showcasing notable potential when considering a combination of in vitro, in vivo, and now in silico data. While the naphthoquinone derivative (11) remains the primary candidate based on comprehensive in silico studies, further analysis using Frontier molecular orbital (FMO) suggests while the Egap value of compound 11 (2.980 eV) and compound 13 (2.975 eV) is lower than ofloxacin (4.369 eV), indicating their potential, so it can be a statement that compound 13 can also be investigated in further research.},

Since the reclassification of L. paragasseri, there has been hardly any report describing the probiotic properties of this species. In this study, an L. paragasseri strain UBLG-36 was sequenced and analyzed to determine the molecular basis that may confer the bacteria with probiotic potential. UBLG-36 was previously documented as an L. gasseri strain. Average nucleotide identity and phylogenomic analysis allowed accurate taxonomic identification of UBLG-36 as an L. paragasseri strain. Analysis of the draft genome ({\textasciitilde}1.94 Mb) showed that UBLG-36 contains 5 contigs with an average G+C content of 34.85\%. Genes essential for the biosynthesis of bacteriocins, adhesion to host epithelium, stress resistance, host immunomodulation, defense, and carbohydrate metabolism were identified in the genome. Interestingly, L. paragasseri UBLG-36 also harbored genes that code for enzymes involved in oxalate catabolism, such as formyl coenzyme A transferase (frc) and oxalyl coenzyme A decarboxylase (oxc). In vitro oxalate degradation assay showed that UBLG-36 is highly effective in degrading oxalate (averaging more than 45\% degradation), a feature that has not been reported before. As a recently identified bacterium, there are limited genomic reports on L. paragasseri, and our draft genome sequence analysis is the first to describe and emphasize the probiotic potential and oxalate degrading ability of this species. With results supporting the probiotic functionalities and oxalate catabolism of UBLG-36, we propose that this strain is likely to have immense biotechnological applications upon appropriate characterization.},

 abstract = {The Earth Microbiome Project (EMP) aided in understanding the role of microbial communities and the influence of collective genetic material (the 'microbiome') and microbial diversity patterns across the habitats of our planet. With the evolution of new sequencing technologies, researchers can now investigate the microbiome and map its influence on the environment and human health. Advances in bioinformatics methods for next-generation sequencing (NGS) data analysis have helped researchers to gain an in-depth knowledge about the taxonomic and genetic composition of microbial communities. Metagenomic-based methods have been the most commonly used approaches for microbiome analysis; however, it primarily extracts information about taxonomic composition and genetic potential of the microbiome under study, lacking quantification of the gene products (RNA and proteins).

 abstract = {The Human Microbiome Project (HMP) aided in understanding the role of microbial communities and the influence of collective genetic material (the ‘microbiome’) in human health and disease. With the evolution of new sequencing technologies, researchers can now investigate the microbiome and map its influence on human health. Advances in bioinformatics methods for next-generation sequencing (NGS) data analysis have helped researchers to gain an in-depth knowledge about the taxonomic and genetic composition of microbial communities. Metagenomic-based methods have been the most commonly used approaches for microbiome analysis; however, it primarily extracts information about taxonomic composition and genetic potential of the microbiome under study, lacking quantification of the gene products (RNA and proteins). Conversely, metatranscriptomics, the study of a microbial community’s RNA expression, can reveal the dynamic gene expression of individual microbial populations and the community as a whole, ultimately providing information about the active pathways in the microbiome.  In order to address the analysis of NGS data, the ASaiM analysis framework was previously developed and made available via the Galaxy platform.

 abstract = {The Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic caused by the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) resulted in a major health crisis worldwide with its continuously emerging new strains, resulting in new viral variants that drive "waves" of infection. PCR or antigen detection assays have been routinely used to detect clinical infections; however, the emergence of these newer strains has presented challenges in detection. One of the alternatives has been to detect and characterize variant-specific peptide sequences from viral proteins using mass spectrometry (MS)-based methods. MS methods can potentially help in both diagnostics and vaccine development by understanding the dynamic changes in the viral proteome associated with specific strains and infection waves. In this study, we developed an accessible, flexible, and shareable bioinformatics workflow that was implemented in the Galaxy Platform to detect variant-specific peptide sequences from MS data derived from the clinical samples. We demonstrated the utility of the workflow by characterizing published clinical data from across the world during various pandemic waves. Our analysis identified six SARS-CoV-2 variant-specific peptides suitable for confident detection by MS in commonly collected clinical samples.},

 abstract = {For mass spectrometry-based peptide and protein quantification, label-free quantification (LFQ) based on precursor mass peak (MS1) intensities is considered reliable due to its dynamic range, reproducibility, and accuracy. LFQ enables peptide-level quantitation, which is useful in proteomics (analyzing peptides carrying post-translational modifications) and multi-omics studies such as metaproteomics (analyzing taxon-specific microbial peptides) and proteogenomics (analyzing non-canonical sequences). Bioinformatics workflows accessible via the Galaxy platform have proven useful for analysis of such complex multi-omic studies. However, workflows within the Galaxy platform have lacked well-tested LFQ tools. In this study, we have evaluated moFF and FlashLFQ, two open-source LFQ tools, and implemented them within the Galaxy platform to offer access and use via established workflows. Through rigorous testing and communication with the tool developers, we have optimized the performance of each tool. Software features evaluated include: (a) match-between-runs (MBR); (b) using multiple file-formats as input for improved quantification; (c) use of containers and/or conda packages; (d) parameters needed for analyzing large datasets; and (e) optimization and validation of software performance. This work establishes a process for software implementation, optimization, and validation, and offers access to two robust software tools for LFQ-based analysis within the Galaxy platform.},

 abstract = {metaQuantome is a software suite that enables the quantitative analysis, statistical evaluation. and visualization of mass-spectrometry-based metaproteomics data. In the latest update of this software, we have provided several extensions, including a step-by-step training guide, the ability to perform statistical analysis on samples from multiple conditions, and a comparative analysis of metatranscriptomics data. The training module, accessed via the Galaxy Training Network, will help users to use the suite effectively both for functional as well as for taxonomic analysis. We extend the ability of metaQuantome to now perform multi-data-point quantitative and statistical analyses so that studies with measurements across multiple conditions, such as time-course studies, can be analyzed. With an eye on the multiomics analysis of microbial communities, we have also initiated the use of metaQuantome statistical and visualization tools on outputs from metatranscriptomics data, which complements the metagenomic and metaproteomic analyses already available. For this, we have developed a tool named MT2MQ (“metatranscriptomics to metaQuantome”), which takes in outputs from the ASaiM metatranscriptomics workflow and transforms them so that the data can be used as an input for comparative statistical analysis and visualization via metaQuantome. We believe that these improvements to metaQuantome will facilitate the use of the software for quantitative metaproteomics and metatranscriptomics and will enable multipoint data analysis. These improvements will take us a step toward integrative multiomic microbiome analysis so as to understand dynamic taxonomic and functional responses of these complex systems in a variety of biological contexts. The updated metaQuantome and MT2MQ are open-source software and are available via the Galaxy Toolshed and GitHub.},

@article{meier_antileukemic_2022,
 abstract = {The prognosis of AML patients with adverse genetics, such as a complex, monosomal karyotype and TP53 lesions, is still dismal even with standard chemotherapy. DNA-hypomethylating agent monotherapy induces an encouraging response rate in these patients. When combined with decitabine (DAC), all-trans retinoic acid (ATRA) resulted in an improved response rate and longer overall survival in a randomized phase II trial (DECIDER; NCT00867672). The molecular mechanisms governing this in vivo synergism are unclear. We now demonstrate cooperative antileukemic effects of DAC and ATRA on AML cell lines U937 and MOLM-13. By RNA-sequencing, derepression of {\textgreater}1200 commonly regulated transcripts following the dual treatment was observed. Overall chromatin accessibility (interrogated by ATAC-seq) and, in particular, at motifs of retinoic acid response elements were affected by both single-agent DAC and ATRA, and enhanced by the dual treatment. Cooperativity regarding transcriptional induction and chromatin remodeling was demonstrated by interrogating the HIC1, CYP26A1, GBP4, and LYZ genes, in vivo gene derepression by expression studies on peripheral blood blasts from AML patients receiving DAC + ATRA. The two drugs also cooperated in derepression of transposable elements, more effectively in U937 (mutated TP53) than MOLM-13 (intact TP53), resulting in a “viral mimicry” response. In conclusion, we demonstrate that in vitro and in vivo, the antileukemic and gene-derepressive epigenetic activity of DAC is enhanced by ATRA.},

 abstract = {Candida glabrata is increasingly isolated from blood cultures, and multidrug-resistant isolates have important implications for therapy. This study describes a cholesterol-dependent clinical C. glabrata isolate (ML72254) that did not grow without blood (containing cholesterol) on routine mycological media and that showed azole and amphotericin B (AmB) resistance. Matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization-time of flight (MALDI-TOF) and whole-genome sequencing (WGS) were used for species identification. A modified Etest method (Mueller-Hinton agar supplemented with 5\% sheep blood) was used for antifungal susceptibility testing. WGS data were processed via the Galaxy platform, and the genomic variations of ML72254 were retrieved. A computational biology workflow utilizing web-based applications (PROVEAN, AlphaFold Colab, and Missense3D) was constructed to predict possible deleterious effects of these missense variations on protein functions. The predictive ability of this workflow was tested with previously reported missense variations in ergosterol synthesis genes of C. glabrata. ML72254 was identified as C. glabrata \textit{sensu stricto} with MALDI-TOF, and WGS confirmed this identification. The MICs of fluconazole, voriconazole, and amphotericin B were {\textgreater}256, {\textgreater}32, and {\textgreater}32 μg/mL, respectively. A novel frameshift mutation in the \textit{ERG1} gene (Pro314fs) and many missense variations were detected in the ergosterol synthesis genes. None of the missense variations in the ML72254 ergosterol synthesis genes were deleterious, and the Pro314fs mutation was identified as the causative molecular change for a cholesterol-dependent and multidrug-resistant phenotype. This study verified that web-based computational biology solutions can be powerful tools for examining the possible impacts of missense mutations in C. glabrata. \textbf{IMPORTANCE} In this study, a cholesterol-dependent C. glabrata clinical isolate that confers azole and AmB resistance was investigated using artificial intelligence (AI) technologies and cloud computing applications. This is the first of the known cholesterol-dependent C. glabrata isolate to be found in Turkey. Cholesterol-dependent C. glabrata isolates are rarely isolated in clinical samples; they can easily be overlooked during routine laboratory procedures. Microbiologists therefore need to be alert when discrepancies occur between microscopic examination and growth on routine media. In addition, because these isolates confer antifungal resistance, patient management requires extra care.},

@article{merida-cerro_rat1_2024,
 abstract = {Certain DNA sequences can adopt a non-B form in the genome that interfere with DNA-templated processes, including transcription. Among the sequences that are intrinsically difficult to transcribe are those that tend to form R-loops, three-stranded nucleic acid structures formed by a DNA-RNA hybrid and the displaced ssDNA. Here we compared the transcription of an endogenous gene with and without an R-loop-forming sequence inserted. We show that, in agreement with previous in vivo and in vitro analyses, transcription elongation is delayed by R-loops in yeast. Importantly, we demonstrate that the Rat1 transcription terminator factor facilitates transcription throughout such structures by inducing premature termination of arrested RNAPIIs. We propose that RNase H degrades the RNA moiety of the hybrid, providing an entry site for Rat1. Thus, we have uncovered an unanticipated function of Rat1 as a transcription restoring factor opening up the possibility that it may also promote transcription through other genomic DNA structures intrinsically difficult to transcribe. If R-loop-mediated transcriptional stress is not relieved by Rat1, it will cause genomic instability, probably through the increase of transcription-replication conflicts, a deleterious situation that could lead to cancer.},

In this study, we designed and deployed a robust, sterilizable hardware system for airborne nucleic acid capture featuring active filtration of a quantifiable, controllable volume of air and a high-integrity chamber to protect the sample from loss or contamination. We used our hardware system on an aircraft across multiple height transects over major aerosolization sources to collect air eDNA, coupled with high-throughput amplicon sequencing using multiple DNA metabarcoding markers targeting bacteria, plants, and vertebrates to test the hypothesis of large-scale genetic presence of these bioaerosols throughout the planetary boundary layer in the lower troposphere. Here, we demonstrate that the multi-taxa DNA assemblages inventoried up to 2,500 m using our airplane-mounted hardware system are reflective of major aerosolization sources in the survey area and show previously unreported airborne species detections (i.e., Allium sativum L). We also pioneer an aerial survey flight grid standardized for atmospheric sampling of genetic material and aeroallergens using a light aircraft and limited resources. Our results show that air eDNA from terrestrial bacteria, plants, and vertebrates is detectable up to high altitude using our airborne air sampler and demonstrate the usefulness of light aircraft in monitoring campaigns. However, our work also underscores the need for improved marker choices and reference databases for species in the air column, particularly eukaryotes. Taken together, our findings reveal strong connectivity or mixing of terrestrial-associated eDNA from ground level aerosolization sources and the atmosphere, and we recommend that parameters and indices considering lifting action, atmospheric instability, and potential for convection be incorporated in future surveys for air eDNA. Overall, this work establishes a foundation for light aircraft campaigns to comprehensively and economically inventory bioaerosol emissions and impacts at scale, enabling transformative future opportunities in airborne DNA technology.},

In January 2021, the re-occurrence of COVID-19 infection was at its peak, considered the second wave of epidemics. In the initial stage, it was considered a double mutant strain due to two significant mutations observed in their Spike protein (E484Q and L452R). Although it was first detected in India later on, it was spread to several countries worldwide, causing high fatality due to this strain. In the present study, we investigated the spreading of B.1.617 strain worldwide through 822 genome sequences submitted in GISAID on 21 April 2021. All genome sequences were analyzed for variations in genome sequences based on their effects due to changes in nucleotides. At Allele frequency 0.05, there were a total of 47 variations in ORF1ab, 22 in Spike protein gene, 6 variations in N gene, 5 in ORF8 and M gene, four mutations in Orf7a, and one nucleotide substitution observed for ORF3a, ORF6 and ORF7b gene. The clustering for similar mutations mentioned B.1.617 sub-lineages. The outcome of this study established relative occurrence and spread worldwide. The study’s finding represented that “double mutant” strain is not only spread through traveling but it is also observed to evolve naturally with different mutations observed in B.1.617 lineage. The information extracted from the study helps to understand viral evolution and genome variations of B.1.617 lineage. The results support the need of separating B.1.617 into sub-lineages.},

@article{meyer_wastewater_2025,
 abstract = {Synthetic antioxidants (SAOs) are widely used additives in industrial and consumer products, yet their human exposure and fate throughout wastewater treatment remain poorly understood. This study investigates the occurrence of SAOs and their human metabolites in wastewater influent as well as their abatement in three wastewater treatment plants (WWTPs) employing both conventional and advanced treatment technologies. In vitro human liver S9 assays were performed to generate a SAO metabolite MS2 library containing over 2500 potential metabolites, which was matched against wastewater influent data. This approach revealed fenozan, which was detected in the influent of all three WWTPs, as a potential biomarker for five of the seven analyzed 3-(3,5-di-tert-butyl-4-hydroxyphenyl)propionate antioxidants. Detection of the glucuronide conjugate in urinary samples together with the tested high hydrolytic stability of the parent SAOs further qualify fenozan as a potential biomarker. Biological wastewater treatment led to high abatement for most SAOs with a mean value of approximately 70\% across all 18 detected SAOs in the three investigated WWTPs. Subsequent ozonation led to further abatement (≥68\%), particularly for the amine antioxidants. This can be attributed to their aniline-type structures with low pKa values, which render their second-order rate constants with ozone pH-independent at pH values typical for wastewater. For phenolic antioxidants in contrast, the second-order rate constants with ozone are pH-dependent, leading to varying abatements. These results emphasize the important role of wastewater treatment in mitigating SAO pollution. Overall, this study demonstrates the value of wastewater monitoring as a unified approach to assess both human and environmental exposure to SAOs.},

@article{miao_putative_2020,
 abstract = {We present a novel method for automated identification of putative cell types from single-cell RNA-seq (scRNA-seq) data. By iteratively applying a machine learning approach to an initial clustering of gene expression profiles of a given set of cells, we simultaneously identify distinct cell groups and a weighted list of feature genes for each group. The feature genes, which are differentially expressed in the particular cell group, jointly discriminate the given cell group from other cells. Each such group of cells corresponds to a putative cell type or state, characterised by the feature genes as markers. To benchmark this approach, we use expert-annotated scRNA-seq datasets from a range of experiments, as well as comparing to existing cell annotation methods, which are all based on a pre-existing reference. We show that our method automatically identifies the 'ground truth' cell assignments with high accuracy. Moreover, our method, Single Cell Clustering Assessment Framework (SCCAF) predicts new putative biologically meaningful cell-states in published data on haematopoiesis and the human cortex. SCCAF is available as an open-source software package on GitHub (https://github.com/SCCAF/sccaf) and as a Python package index and has also been implemented as a Galaxy tool in the Human Cell Atlas.},

@article{midtbo_cell_2024,
 abstract = {The salmon louse (Lepeophtheirus salmonis) is an ectoparasite feeding on mucus, skin, and blood of salmonids. On parasitised fish erosions and, at later lice stages, ulcerations appear at the louse feeding site. In susceptible species like Atlantic salmon (Salmo salar) with a limited rejection of lice, only a mild inflammatory response with minor influx of immune cells is seen at these lesions, as the salmon louse secrete proteins that can dampen immune responses. In a previous study, Lepeophtheirus salmonis labial gland protein 3 (LsLGP3) was suggested to dampen cellular responses, and the present study aimed at increasing our understanding of its mode of action. LsLGP3 was found to be secreted on to the host skin, and both in vivo and in vitro experiments were performed to elucidate its function. Histological analysis of the louse attachment site revealed an epidermal and dermal influx of mainly macrophages and granulocytes after 5 days post infestation. The immune cell influx was deeper in the dermis throughout the louse infestation, and LsLGP3 may be involved in dampening this response. Enriched populations of Atlantic salmon B-cells, T-cells, granulocytes, and monocytes were exposed to recombinant LsLGP3 (recLGP3) in vitro, resulting in a significant decrease in cell viability compared to non-exposed controls. An apoptotic cell morphology with “beads-on-a-string” like protrusions was seen in all leukocyte cell fractions after recLGP3 exposure, but not in erythrocytes or keratocytes. A decreased viability was also detected in pink salmon leucocytes, which was not in leucocytes from non-salmonid species. These functional insights suggest that LsLGP3 specifically induces apoptosis of salmonid leukocytes and is likely a key protein secreted by the lice that disables the Atlantic salmon ability to mount an adequate immune response towards the salmon louse. In vivo LsLGP3 knock down studies indicated that the effect is localised primarily at the lice feeding site, without affecting immune cells that are not situated adjacent to the lice-inflicted lesion. The findings from this study could significantly aid in the development of new immune based anti-salmon louse prophylactic measures and treatments.},

 abstract = {In 2019 the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) caused the first documented cases of severe lung disease COVID-19. Since then, SARS-CoV-2 has been spreading around the globe resulting in a severe pandemic with over 500.000 fatalities and large economical and social disruptions in human societies. Gaining knowledge on how SARS-Cov-2 interacts with its host cells and causes COVID-19 is crucial for the intervention of novel therapeutic strategies. SARS-CoV-2, like other coronaviruses, is a positive-strand RNA virus. The viral RNA is modified by RNA-modifying enzymes provided by the host cell. Direct RNA sequencing (DRS) using nanopores enables unbiased sensing of canonical and modified RNA bases of the viral transcripts. In this work, we used DRS to precisely annotate the open reading frames and the landscape of SARS-CoV-2 RNA modifications. We provide the first DRS data of SARS-CoV-2 in infected human lung epithelial cells. From sequencing three isolates, we derive a robust identification of SARS-CoV-2 modification sites within a physiologically relevant host cell type. A comparison of our data with the DRS data from a previous SARS-CoV-2 isolate, both raised in monkey renal cells, reveals consistent RNA modifications across the viral genome. Conservation of the RNA modification pattern during progression of the current pandemic suggests that this pattern is likely essential for the life cycle of SARS-CoV-2 and represents a possible target for drug interventions.},

 abstract = {Pregnancy involving intricate tissue transformations governed by the progesterone hormone (P4). P4 signaling via P4 receptors (PRs) is vital for endometrial receptivity, decidualization, myometrial quiescence, and labor initiation. This study explored the role of TCF23 as a downstream target of PR during pregnancy. TCF23 was found to be expressed in female reproductive organs, predominantly in uterine stromal and smooth muscle cells. Tcf23 expression was high during midgestation and was specifically regulated by P4, but not estrogen. The Tcf23 knockout (KO) mouse was generated and analyzed. Female KO mice aged 4-6 months exhibited subfertility, reduced litter size, and defective parturition. Uterine histology revealed disrupted myometrial structure, altered collagen organization, and disarrayed smooth muscle sheets at the conceptus sites of KO mice. RNA-Seq analysis of KO myometrium revealed dysregulation of genes associated with cell adhesion and extracellular matrix organization. TCF23 potentially modulates TCF12 activity to mediate cell-cell adhesion and matrix modulation in smooth muscle cells. Overall, TCF23 deficiency leads to impaired myometrial remodeling, causing parturition delay and fetal demise. This study sheds light on the critical role of TCF23 as a dowstream mediator of PR in uterine remodeling, reflecting the importance of cell-cell communication and matrix dynamics in myometrial activation and parturition.},

Here, we generated a de novo transcriptome assembly of an intergeneric hybrid between apple and pear, accumulating intermediate levels of phloridzin and arbutin. Combining RNA-seq, in silico functional annotation prediction, targeted gene expression analysis, and expression–metabolite correlations, we identified candidate genes for functional characterization, resulting in the identification of active arbutin synthases in the hybrid and parental genotypes. Despite exhibiting an active arbutin synthase in vitro, the natural lack of arbutin in apples is reasoned by the absence of the substrate and broad substrate specificity. Altogether, our study serves as the basis for future assessment of potential physiological roles of identified genes by genome editing of hybrids and pears.},

 abstract = {COVID-19 pathogenesis is mainly attributed to dysregulated antiviral immune response, the prominent hallmark of COVID-19. As no established drugs are available against SARS-CoV-2 and developing new ones would be a big challenge, repurposing of existing drugs holds promise against COVID-19. Here, we used a signature-based strategy to delve into cellular responses to SARS-CoV-2 infection in order to identify potential host contributors in COVID-19 pathogenesis and to find repurposable drugs using in silico approaches. We scrutinized transcriptomic profile of various human alveolar cell sources infected with SARS-CoV-2 to determine up-regulated genes specific to COVID-19. Enrichment analysis revealed that the up-regulated genes were involved mainly in viral infectious disease, immune system, and signal transduction pathways. Analysis of protein-protein interaction network and COVID-19 molecular pathway resulted in identifying several anti-viral proteins as well as 11 host pro-viral proteins, ADAR, HBEGF, MMP9, USP18, JUN, FOS, IRF2, ICAM1, IFI35, CASP1, and STAT3. Finally, molecular docking of up-regulated proteins and all FDA-approved drugs revealed that both Hydrocortisone and Benzhydrocodone possess high binding affinity for all pro-viral proteins. The suggested repurposed drugs should be subject to complementary in vitro and in vivo experiments in order to be evaluated in detail prior to clinical studies in potential management of COVID-19.},

@mastersthesis{missaghimamaghani_evaluation_2023,
 abstract = {Microglia, the resident immune cells of the central nervous system, play a crucial role in maintaining brain homeostasis and responding to pathological changes. However, the aging process can significantly impact microglial function, leading to neurodegenerative diseases like Alzheimer's disease (AD). One aspect of microglial dysfunction during aging involves changes in gene expression, causing abnormal activation or suppression of specific genes. This abnormal gene expression contributes to the pro-inflammatory state observed in aging microglia and AD. In AD, microglia are responsible for clearing amyloid-beta (Aβ) plaques, a key pathology in the disease. Aging-related alterations impair the microglial ability to effectively remove Aβ plaques, leading to their accumulation and subsequent neuroinflammation. Aberrant gene expression in aging microglia affects phagocytic activity, inflammatory response, and release of neurotoxic factors, exacerbating AD progression. Studies have shown that certain Eukaryotic Translation Initiation Factor 3 (EIF3) subunits and ribosomal proteins (RP) involved in translation initiation are upregulated in aging microglia at mRNA level. However, the upregulation of these proteins should be examined at the protein level as well due to the post-transcription and translational regulatory processes. Therefore, the levels of these proteins were examined in wild type and APP/PS1 mouse models during aging. The results revealed an increase in different subunits of translation initiation factor 3 specifically EIF3H, EIF3E, EIF3K, and p-EIF4E in microglia during aging and with progression of AD. While RPL7, RPL7A, and RPS25 exhibited a different pattern. Although the results demonstrate upregulation of these proteins in an age-related manner, in APP mice, these proteins showed downregulation compared to wild type mice of the same age. These distinct regulation patterns suggested a crucial role of these proteins in aging and AD. Furthermore, to enhance our comprehension of the functions of EIF3H and EIF3E, we undertook a nucleofection-based strategy to overexpress these proteins within microglial cells. However, the nucleofection attempts were unsuccessful as often reported in the literature for BV-2 cell line. Understanding the significance of aberrant gene expression in aging microglia and its association with AD is crucial for targeted therapeutic strategies. Modulating gene expression and restoring normal microglial function may hold promise in reducing neuroinflammation, promoting Aβ clearance, and potentially slowing down AD progression. EIF4E, also known as eukaryotic translation initiation factor 4E, plays a crucial role in regulating protein synthesis. One of the key mechanisms governing the activity of EIF4E is its phosphorylation which is vital for modulating EIF4E's function and fine-tuning translation initiation. Phosphorylation of EIF4E is tightly regulated by various signaling pathways and is essential for controlling gene expression in response to different cellular stimuli. It acts as a molecular switch, influencing the assembly of the translation initiation complex and determining the efficiency of protein synthesis. Understanding the importance of EIF4E phosphorylation opens avenues for potential therapeutic interventions targeting this key protein and therefore regulating the rate of protein synthesis in this regard. As part of this exploration, we investigated the effect of Tomivosertib, an inhibitor of EIF4E phosphorylation, which controls translation rates. The results demonstrated that Tomivosertib effectively inhibits EIF4E phosphorylation by suppressing MNK1/2 in microglia, thereby decreasing translation rates and alleviating neuroinflammation.},

WGS of carbapenemase-producing E. coli (n = 15/48,31\%) and K. pneumoniae (n = 13/26,50\%) revealed the presence of blaNDM-1,5,7 (n = 21), blaKPC-2 (n = 1), and blaOXA-181,232 (n = 8). Isolates were diverse and belonged to different sequence types, including epidemic clones (K. pneumoniae-ST16/101/147/231; E. coli-ST167/410/648). This study has noted the allelic shift of blaNDM-1 to blaNDM-5 similar to global reports. blaNDM-1,5,7-bearing plasmids were conjugative but those carrying blaKPC-2 and blaOXA-181,232 were non-conjugative. blaNDM-1,5,7 were present in diverse replicons: IncF-types (predominant), IncHI1B, IncX3, and IncX4, etc., while blaOXA-181,232 were present in ColKP3, corroborating with global studies. blaNDM-1,5 was associated with intact/truncated ISAba125 in Tn125, blaNDM-7 with IS3000, blaKPC-2 with ISKpn6, and ISKpn7 in Tn4401b, and blaOXA-181,232 with ∆ISEcp1 in Tn2013, depicting an ancestral genetic context noted globally. Study isolates were related to other Indian isolates, primarily from blood.DiscussionThe association with different MGEs noted in the study is similar to those in other parts of India and the globe, signifying that the genetic determinants are part of the global gene pool. These associations can facilitate the spread of carbapenem resistance, leading to outbreaks and treatment failures.},

It consists of two components, the Cas9 effector protein, and a single guide RNA that combines the spacer (for identifying the target) with the tracrRNA, a trans-activating small RNA required for both crRNA maturation and interference. While there are well-established methods for screening Cas effector proteins and CRISPR arrays, the detection of tracrRNA remains the bottleneck in detecting Class 2 CRISPR systems.We introduce a new pipeline CRISPRtracrRNA for screening and evaluation of tracrRNA candidates in genomes. This pipeline combines evidence from different components of the Cas9-sgRNA complex. The core is a newly developed structural model via covariance models from a sequence-structure alignment of experimentally validated tracrRNAs. As additional evidence, we determine the terminator signal (required for the tracrRNA transcription) and the RNA–RNA interaction between the CRISPR array repeat and the 5′-part of the tracrRNA. Repeats are detected via an ML-based approach (CRISPRidenify). Providing further evidence, we detect the cassette containing the Cas9 (Type II CRISPR systems) and Cas12 (Type V CRISPR systems) effector protein. Our tool is the first for detecting tracrRNA for Type V systems.The implementation of the CRISPRtracrRNA is available on GitHub upon requesting the access permission, (https://github.com/BackofenLab/CRISPRtracrRNA).

 abstract = {Background/Objectives: Streptococcus suis is a zoonotic pathogen that causes infections in pigs and humans, leading to significant economic losses. S. suis can evade the immune system of hosts and induce persistent infections. Early detection and vaccination are crucial for controlling the disease in swine industries. This study aimed to investigate candidate recombinant protein for antibodies against S. suis detection and subunit vaccine development. Methods: The whole genome of S. suis BM407 was analyzed using bioinformatic tools to predict suitable proteins and genes for recombinant protein expression. Partial extracellular factor protein (epf) genes of S. suis serotype 2 DMST18783 were amplified. A 3301 bp amplicon was digested, and a specific 615 bp fragment was inserted into a pQE81L-KAN vector. Then, the constructed plasmid was cloned and expressed in Escherichia coli DH10β. Purified protein was analyzed using SDS-PAGE. In addition, translated amino acid sequences were analyzed for immune response properties, molecular docking, molecular dynamic simulation, and epitope prediction. Results: The amino acid sequence of recombinant extracellular factor protein (rEF) was revealed as a promising antigen containing putative protective regions as linear epitopes. Furthermore, the rEF was expressed as a histidine-tagged recombinant protein, and its properties were nearly similar to the predicted rEF using bioinformatic tools. Binding of the recombinant EF (rEF) protein was found to reduce fluctuations in the swine toll-like receptor 2. Furthermore, the rEF contained several regions that were predicted to be epitopes for both B-cells and T-cells. Conclusions: This study indicates that the recombinant EF fragment is a promising candidate for detecting antibodies against S. suis and as a component of a subunit vaccine.},

The methodology involves characterizing aptamer-E. coli interactions, identifying key aptamer structural features and docking analysis of binding process between aptamer and E. coli. In conclusion, this research bridges theory for future applications, providing a framework for developing advanced biosensing technologies, by using the in-silico strategies that allowed the detection of aptamer-target interaction during molecular docking processes.},

 abstract = {Rice tungro disease (RTD), caused by Rice tungro bacilliform virus (RTBV) and Rice tungro spherical virus (RTSV) is one of the most prominent viral diseases in Asian countries. This virus disease problem seems to have been accentuated in those countries by causing a series of outbreaks over the years after being first reported in International Rice Research Institute (IRRI), Philippines, in 1963. One of the effective ways to combat viruses is through RNA silencing. microRNA is an important player in the RNA silencing mechanism. Genome sequences analysis shows RTBV-SP isolate (8 Kb) is composed of four open reading frames (ORF 1, ORF 2, ORF 3, and ORF 4), meanwhile, RTSV-SP (12 Kb) consists of one open reading frame encoded by seven different polyproteins (P1, CP1, CP2, CP3, NTP, Pro, and Rep). Therefore, this study investigated possible rice-encoded miRNAs targeted on RTBV and RTSV using in silico analysis. Five bioinformatics tools were employed using five different prediction algorithms: miRanda, RNA22, RNAhybrid, Tapirhybrid, and psRNATarget. The results revealed each RTBV and RTSV can be silenced by three potentially best candidate rice-encoded miRNA. For RTBV, osa-miR5510 (accession no. MIMAT0022143), osa-miR3980a-3p (accession no. MIMAT0019676), and osa-miR3980b-3p (accession no. MIMAT0019678) are being predicted by all five algorithms. Meanwhile, for RTSV, three miRNAs predicted are osa-miR414 (accession no. MIMAT0001330), osa-miR5505 (accession no. MIMAT00221138) and osa-miR167a-3p (accession no. MIMAT0006780). The predicted data provide useful material for developing RTBV and RTSV-resistant rice varieties.},

 abstract = {The primary objective of this study is to harness computer-aided drug repurposing (CADR) techniques to identify existing FDA-approved drugs that can potentially disrupt the assembly of the Hepatitis B Virus (HBV) core protein (HBcAg), an essential process in the virus’s life cycle. By targeting this critical step, our study aims to expand the repertoire of therapeutic options for managing chronic Hepatitis B infection, a major global health challenge. Utilizing a combination of computational methods, including the CavityPlus server for ability to analyze druggable protein cavities and extract pharmacophore features and LigandScout for pharmacophore-based virtual screening of a vast library of FDA-approved drugs was conducted. Molecular dynamic simulation (MDS) was employed to evaluate the stability of HBcAg, complexed with Heteroaryldihydropyrimidine (HAP) and statins exhibiting particularly strong binding energies and conformational compatibility. Our approach focused on identifying pharmacophore features that align with known HBcAg inhibitors. The study identified several promising candidates, including Ciclopirox olamine, Voriconazole, Enasidenib, and statins, demonstrating potential interactions with HBc protein residues. Molecular docking further validated these interactions. The significance of these findings lies in their potential to offer new, effective therapeutic strategies for HBV treatment, particularly as alternatives to current therapies that often suffer from issues of viral resistance and adverse side effects. MDS analysis verified the robustness of HAP and statins by showing a high level of binding energies and compatibility with HBcAg. Our results provide a foundation for further experimental validation and underscore the utility of computer-aided drug repurposing as a rapid, cost-effective approach to drug discovery in antiviral research. This study contributes to our understanding of HBV biology and opens avenues for developing novel anti-HBV therapies based on repurposed drugs. The highlighted compound may also enhance the challenges of drug resistance when used as a combination therapy.},

 abstract = {Breast cancer (BC) is one of the leading causes of cancer-related deaths in women. The present study explored the potential role of pseudogenes in BC via construction and analysis of a competing endogenous RNA (ceRNA) network through a three-step process. First, we screened differentially expressed genes in nine BC datasets. Then the gene-pseudogenes pairs (nine hub genes) were selected according to the functional enrichment and correlation analysis. Second, the candidate hub genes and interacting miRNAs were used to construct the ceRNA network. Further analysis of the ceRNA network revealed a crucial ceRNA module with two genes-pseudogene pairs and two miRNAs. The in-depth analysis identified the GBP1/hsa-miR-30d-5p/GBP1P1 axis as a potential tumorigenic axis in BC patients. In the third step, the GBP1/hsa-miR-30d-5p/GBP1P1 axis expression level was assessed in 40 tumor/normal BC patients and MCF-7 cell lines. The expression of GBP1 and GBP1P1 was significantly higher in the tumor compared to the normal tissue. However, the expression of hsa-miR-30d-5p was lower in tumor samples. Then, we introduced the GBP1P1 pseudogene into the MCF-7 cell line to evaluate its effect on GBP1 and hsa-miR-30d-5p expression. As expected, the GBP1 level increased while the hsa-miR-30d-5p level decreased in the GBP1P1-overexprsssing cell line. In addition, the oncogenic properties of MCF-7 (cell viability, clonogenicity, and migration) were improved after GBP1P1 overexpression. In conclusion, we report a ceRNA network that may provide new insight into the role of pseudogenes in BC development.},

 abstract = {The lack of complete genetic information on the pitaya (Hylocereus spp.) genome and the absence of annotations in biological databases hinder the precise identification of genes expressed under stress conditions. To address this challenge, this study focused on annotating genes involved in the biosynthesis of phenolic compounds in pitaya under biotic (pathogen infection) and abiotic (flowering induction with supplementary light) stress conditions. Using various bioinformatic techniques, transcriptomic data were analyzed to assemble de novo sequences from raw reads for each stress condition. The quality of these assemblies was rigorously evaluated, and a consensus sequence was generated to analyze its homology with related species. Structural and functional annotation of the assemblies was conducted using ab initio and de novo prediction tools, resulting in annotations in GFF3 format that detail both the structure and biological functions of the predicted genes. Subsequently, a differential expression analysis (DEG) was performed to identify genes expressed in the biosynthesis of phenolic compounds under different stress conditions. The results revealed nine key enzymes involved in the metabolic pathways of phenylpropanoids, flavonoids, and anthocyanins. Additionally, a MYB transcription factor that regulates gene expression in these pathways was identified. This research underscores the complexity of pitaya's adaptive mechanisms in response to stress, highlighting its activation of specific biosynthetic processes that enhance antioxidant capacity and adaptive ability under adverse conditions.},

This study explores the lignocellulolytic and electrogenic potential of Shewanella oneidensis MR-1, Cellulomonas fimi ATCC 484, and Cellulomonas biazotea NBRC 12680 on LCB. Two strategies were tested: assessing strains LCB degradation ability under non-electrochemical and electrochemical conditions. Strain selection was based on literature, and bioinformatical analyses were conducted to predict CAZymes and carbohydrate degradation pathways. Cellulomonas strains have a potential to degrade LCB due to high CAZyme count and specific metabolic pathways. Strains growth capacity on LCB was evaluated by culturing without electrodes on LCB for 12 days, showing superior growth on wheat bran compared to wheat straw. Enzymatic assays indicate laccase activity in all strains, highest in C. biazotea NBRC 12680 (11.66 IU). The strains ability to form electrogenic biofilms on carbon cloth anodes polarized at +0.2 V (vs Ag/AgCl) was evaluated. The results indicate that bioanodes can function with wheat bran (max current density: 14.92 mA m−2), with voltammograms showing redox activities. Attenuated total reflection Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy shows lignin and protein degradation in both electrochemical and non-electrochemical experiments. These findings suggest potential use of these strains in electro-microbial systems with LCB.},

 abstract = {Wild rodents serve as crucial reservoirs for zoonotic viruses. Anthropogenic and environmental disruptions, particularly those induced by mining activities, can destabilize rodent populations and facilitate the emergence of viral agents. In the Canaã dos Carajás and Curionópolis regions of Brazil, significant environmental changes have occurred due to mining expansion, potentially creating conditions conducive to the emergence of rodent-associated viral diseases. This study aimed to investigate the viral diversity in wild rodents captured in Canaã dos Carajás and Curionópolis, Pará, between 2017 and 2019. A total of 102 rodent samples were taxonomically identified through karyotyping and screened for anti-\textit{Orthohantavirus} antibodies using the ELISA method. Subsequently, nucleotide sequencing and bioinformatics analyses were conducted on 14 selected samples to characterize the virome. This selection was based on the most commonly associated rodent genera as reservoirs of \textit{Orthohantavirus} and \textit{Mammarenavirus}. Of the 102 samples tested via ELISA, 100 were negative, and two showed optical density at the cutoff point. Sequencing of the 14 samples generated approximately 520 million reads, with 409 million retained after quality control. These reads were categorized into 53 viral families, including both DNA and RNA viruses, with \textit{Retroviridae, Baculoviridae}, and \textit{Microviridae} being the most abundant. Viral contigs were identified, including one fragment related to \textit{Arenaviridae} and three to \textit{Filoviridae}. Metagenomic analysis revealed high viral diversity in the sampled rodents, with the presence of viral families of public health concern, such as \textit{Arenaviridae} and \textit{Filoviridae}. The findings suggest that increased human activities associated with mining may contribute to the emergence of these viruses, underscoring the need for ongoing surveillance to prevent potential outbreaks.},

The plasmid content of the metagenomics data from 8 sediment samples of the Gulfs of Kathiawar and an open Arabian Sea sample was screened. The reads corresponding to hits against the plasmid database were assembled and studied for diversity using Kraken and functional content using MG-RAST. The sequences were also checked for resistome and virulence factors. The replicon hosts were overall dominated by Proteobacteria, Firmicutes, and Actinobacteria while red algae specific to the Kutch samples. The genes encoded were dominant in the flagella motility and type VI secretion systems. Overall, results from the study confirmed that the plasmids encoded traits for metal, antibiotic, and phage resistance along with virulence systems, and these would be conferring benefit to the hosts. The study throws insights into the environmental role of the plasmidome in adaptation of the microbes in the studied sites to the environmental stresses.},

 abstract = {There are currently no vaccines available to prevent and control of Anaplasma phagocytophilum, an intracellular bacterial pathogen transmitted by ticks that occurs in many regions of the world and causes disease in a wide range of domestic and wild hosts, including humans. Vaccines induce long-lasting immunity and could prevent or reduce transmission of this pathogen. Understanding how vaccines induce a protective response can be difficult due to the complexity of the immune system, which operates at many levels throughout the organism. New perspectives in vaccinology, based on systems biology approaches, integrate many scientific disciplines to fully understand the biological responses to vaccination, where a transcriptomic approach could reveal relevant information of the host immune system, allowing profiling for rational design of vaccine formulations, administration, and potential protection. In the present study we report the gene expression profiles by RNA-seq followed by functional analysis using whole blood samples from rabbits immunized with a recombinant chimeric protein containing peptides from the MSP4 protein of A. phagocytophilum, which showed satisfactory results in terms of potential protection. Transcriptomic analysis revealed differential expression of 720 genes, with 346 genes upregulated and 374 genes downregulated. Overrepresentation of biological and metabolic pathways correlated with immune response, protein signaling, cytoskeleton organization and protein synthesis were found. These changes in gene expression could provide a complete and unique picture of the biological response to the epitope candidate vaccine against A. phagocytophilum in the host.},

Recent findings reported their functional role in cancer. The aim of this study was to evaluate the DNA methylation modifications of UNCEs in squamous cell carcinoma (SCC) from different mammal species. Methods: Fifty SCCs from 26 humans, 17 cats, 3 dogs, 1 horse, 1 bovine, 1 badger, and 1 porcupine were investigated. Fourteen feline stomatitis and normal samples from 36 healthy human donors, 7 cats, 5 dogs, 5 horses, 2 bovines and 1 badger were collected as normal controls. Bisulfite next generation sequencing evaluated the DNA methylation level from seven UCNEs (uc.160, uc.283, uc.416, uc.339, uc.270, uc.299, and uc.328). Results: 57/59 CpGs were significantly different according to the Kruskal\&ndash;Wallis test (p \&lt; 0.05) comparing normal samples with SCC. A common DNA hypermethylation pattern was observed in SCCs from all the species evaluated in this study, with an increasing trend of hypermethylation starting from normal mucosa, through stomatitis to SCC. Conclusions: Our findings indicate that UCNEs are hypermethylated in human SCC, and this behavior is also conserved among different species of mammals.},

While the main enzymatic steps of CHC biosynthesis are well understood, few of the underlying genes have been identified. Here we show how exploitation of intrasexual CHC dimorphism in a mason wasp, Odynerus spinipes, in combination with whole-genome sequencing and comparative transcriptomics facilitated identification of such genes. RNAi-mediated knockdown of twelve candidate gene orthologs in the honey bee, Apis mellifera, confirmed nine genes impacting CHC profile composition. Most of them have predicted functions consistent with current knowledge of CHC metabolism. However, we found first-time evidence for a fatty acid amide hydrolase also influencing CHC profile composition. In situ hybridization experiments furthermore suggest trophocytes participating in CHC biosynthesis. Our results set the base for experimental CHC profile manipulation in Hymenoptera and imply that the evolutionary origin of CHC biosynthesis predates the arthropods’ colonization of land.},

 abstract = {{\textless}h4{\textgreater}Background{\textless}/h4{\textgreater}The biological effects of spaceflight remain incompletely understood, even in humans (Homo sapiens), and are largely unexplored in non-traditional models such as bdelloid rotifers.{\textless}h4{\textgreater}Results{\textless}/h4{\textgreater}This study analyzes the transcriptomic changes experienced by Adineta vaga, a bdelloid rotifer aboard the International Space Station (ISS), using RNA sequencing. The aim was to investigate the overall effect of spaceflight in Low Earth Orbit (LEO) on these organisms. To this end, new hardware was developed to enable autonomous culturing of rotifers with minimal astronaut intervention. The study revealed significant transcriptomic changes, with 18.61\% of genes showing differential expression in response to microgravity and radiation. These changes included upregulation of genes involved in protein synthesis, RNA metabolic processes, and DNA repair. Notably, the study also found a significant enrichment of foreign genes (Horizontal Gene Transfers: HGTs) among the genes that were either over- or under-expressed during spaceflight, suggesting that HGTs play a role in bdelloids' adaptability to new and potentially atypical environments.{\textless}h4{\textgreater}Conclusions{\textless}/h4{\textgreater}This research not only enhances our understanding of how organisms respond to microgravity but also proposes A. vaga as a valuable model for future studies in space biology.},

We assessed the usefulness of real-time metagenomics (RTM) directly applied to the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) for the identification, typing and susceptibility profiling of pathogens responsible for community-acquired meningitis.{\textless}h4{\textgreater}Methods{\textless}/h4{\textgreater}A series of 52 CSF samples from patients suspected of having community-acquired meningitis, were investigated at POC by direct RTM in parallel to routine real-time multiplex PCR (RT-PCR) and bacterial culture, for the detection of pathogens. RTM-generated sequences were blasted in real-time against an in-house database incorporating the panel of 12 most prevalent pathogens and against NCBI using EPI2ME online software, for pathogen identification. In-silico antibiogram and genotype prediction were determined using the ResFinder bio-tool and MLST online software.{\textless}h4{\textgreater}Findings{\textless}/h4{\textgreater}Over eight months, routine multiplex RT-PCR yielded 49/52 positive CSFs, including 21 Streptococcus pneumoniae, nine Neisseria meningitidis, eight Haemophilus influenzae, three Streptococcus agalactiae, three Herpesvirus-1, two Listeria monocytogenes, and one each of Escherichia coli, Staphylococcus aureus and Varicella-Zoster Virus. Parallel RTM agreed with the results of 47/52 CSFs and revealed two discordant multiplex RT-PCR false positives, one H. influenzae and one S. pneumoniae. Both multiplex RT-PCR and RTM agreed on the negativity of three CSFs. While multiplex RT-PCR routinely took 90 min, RTM took 120 min, although the pipeline analysis detected the pathogen genome after 20 min of sequencing in 33 CSF samples; and after two hours in 14 additional CSFs; yielding {\textgreater} 50\% genome coverage in 19 CSFs. RTM identified 14 pathogen genotypes, including a majority of H. influenzae b, N. meningitidis B and S. pneumoniae 11A and 3A. In all 16 susceptible cultured bacteria, the in-silico antibiogram agreed with the in-vitro antibiogram in 10 cases, available within 48 h in routine bacteriology.{\textless}h4{\textgreater}Interpretation{\textless}/h4{\textgreater}In addition to pathogen detection, RTM applied to CSF samples offered supplementary information on bacterial profiling and genotyping.

Here, we compared microglial transcriptomes from young-adult and aged mice housed under germ-free and specific pathogen-free conditions and found that the microbiota influenced aging associated-changes in microglial gene expression. The absence of gut microbiota diminished oxidative stress and ameliorated mitochondrial dysfunction in microglia from the brains of aged mice. Unbiased metabolomic analyses of serum and brain tissue revealed the accumulation of N6-carboxymethyllysine (CML) in the microglia of the aging brain. CML mediated a burst of reactive oxygen species and impeded mitochondrial activity and ATP reservoirs in microglia. We validated the age-dependent rise in CML levels in the sera and brains of humans. Finally, a microbiota-dependent increase in intestinal permeability in aged mice mediated the elevated levels of CML. This study adds insight into how specific features of microglia from aged mice are regulated by the gut microbiota.},

 abstract = {Changing climatic conditions with rising temperatures and altered precipitation patterns pose significant challenges to agricultural productivity, particularly for common bean crops. Transcription factors (TFs) are crucial regulators that can mitigate the impact of biotic and abiotic stresses on crop production. The MADS-box TFs family has been implicated in various plant physiological processes, including stress-responsive mechanisms. However, their role in common bean and their response to stressful conditions remain poorly understood. Here, we identified 35 MADS-box gene family members in common bean, with conserved MADS-box domains and other functional domains. Gene duplication events were observed, suggesting the significance of duplication in the evolutionary development of gene families. The analysis of promoter regions revealed diverse elements, including stress-responsive elements, indicating their potential involvement in stress responses. Notably, PvMADS31, a member of the PvMADS-box gene family, demonstrated rapid upregulation under various abiotic stress conditions, including NaCl, polyethylene glycol, drought, and abscisic acid (ABA) treatments. Transgenic plants overexpressing PvMADS31 displayed enhanced lateral root development, root elongation, and seed germination under stress conditions. Furthermore, PvMADS31 overexpression in Arabidopsis resulted in improved drought tolerance, likely attributed to the enhanced scavenging of ROS and increased proline accumulation. These findings suggest that PvMADS31 might play a crucial role in modulating seed germination, root development, and stress responses, potentially through its involvement in auxin and ABA signaling pathways. Overall, this study provides valuable insights into the potential roles of PvMADS-box genes in abiotic stress responses in common bean, offering prospects for crop improvement strategies to enhance resilience under changing environmental conditions.},

The mitogenomes of members assigned to this order exhibit size polymorphism despite having highly conserved gene order, owing to the variable number of introns and intron insertion sites. In this work, eleven blue-stain fungi, including nine strains of \textit{Ophiostomaips} with a varied distribution across North America and New Zealand, were sequenced and compared with other members of the \textit{Ophiostomatales}. A pan-mitogenome intron landscape has been prepared to demonstrate the distribution of the mobile genetic elements and to provide insight into the evolutionary dynamics of introns among members of this group of fungi. The size variation among these mitogenomes (from about 23.8 kb to 152 kb) shows high correlation to the presence and absence of introns. Examples of complex or nested introns composed of two or three intron modules have been observed in some \textit{O.ips} strains. RNA-seq data suggests possible splicing pathways with regard to resolving these complex introns. Mitochondrial DNA and RNA data for \textit{O.ips} provides the basis for future studies relating to gene annotation, alternative splicing, evolutionary intron dynamics, and taxonomic investigations for members of the \textit{Ophiostomatales}.},

However, most published preclinical data are not conducted according to the standard Good Laboratory Practice (GLP). GLP is mandatory for preclinical analysis of Advanced Therapy Medicinal Products (ATMP) and thereby a prerequisite for planning and conduction of clinical trials. Not inconsiderable numbers of clinical trials are terminated earlier or fail – do inadequate testing strategies or missing specialized assays during the preclinical development contribute to this severe complex of problems? Unfortunately, there is also a lack of access to GLP testing results and OECD (Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development) GLP guidelines are not yet adjusted to ATMP specialties. Ultimately, GLP offers possibilities to generate reliable and reproducible data. Therefore, this review elucidates different GLP aspects in drug development, speculates on reasons of putative low GLP acceptance in the scientific community and mentions solution proposals.},

 abstract = {Background
Diet induced weight loss represents an intervention for obesity to prevent associated diseases. However there is considerable inter-individual variation. Single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) and plasma miRNA might be contributing factors. We therefore hypothesized that changes in the miRNA pattern during weight loss depend on the SNP genotype.
Methods
Plasma miRNA profiles from 12 patients were determined before and after a three month weight loss intervention by Illumina sequencing. 46 further patients were analyzed by qPCR. SNP genotypes were determined on the Sequenom iPLEX platform.
Results
Samples before and after weight loss were analyzed by miRNA-seq and delta miRNA levels ranked according to p-value. Levels of miRNAs 25, 93 and 106 that are expressed from a common genomic cluster were reduced after weight loss. Those results were substantiated in a qPCR analysis of 46 additional patients. This is in accordance with mouse data showing a functional involvement of this cluster in obesity. Correlation of the changes in miRNA abundance with SNP genotypes revealed a statistical association of all three miRNAs with known obesity susceptibility SNPs.
Conclusion
Diet induced weight loss leads to SNP dependent modulation of miRNAs from the miR 25/93/106 gene cluster in humans.},

CASP8AP2 was identified as the only hit that significantly affected the viability of all eight screened LUAD cell lines while the viability of non-transformed lung cells was only moderately impacted. Knockdown (KD) of CASP8AP2 induced both autophagy and apoptotic cell death pathways. Systematic expression profiling linked the AP-1 transcription factor to the CASP8AP2 KD-induced cancer cell death. Furthermore, inhibition of AP-1 reverted the CASP8AP2 silencing-induced phenotype. Overall, the tailored CRISPRi screen profiled the impact of over 2000 genes on the survival of eight LUAD cell lines and identified the CASP8AP2 – AP-1 axis mediating lung cancer viability.},

Despite its historical association with childhood, dental caries often persists into adulthood with prevalence rates ranging from 60 to 90\% in children and 26 to 85\% in adults. Currently, there is a dearth of multiepitope vaccines (MEVs) specifically designed to combat S. mutans. To address this gap, we employed an immunoinformatics approach for MEV design, identifying five promising vaccine candidates (PBP2X, PBP2b, MurG, ATP-F, and AGPAT) based on antigenicity and conservation using several tools including CELLO v.2.5, Vaxign, v2.0, ANTIGENpro, and AllerTop v2.0 tools. Subsequent identification of linear B-cell and T-cell epitopes by SVMTrip and NetCTL/NetMHC II tools, respectively, guided the construction of a MEV comprising 10 Cytotoxic T Lymphocyte (CTL) epitopes, 5 Helper T Lymphocyte (HTL) epitopes, and 5 linear B-cell epitopes, interconnected by suitable linkers. The resultant MEV demonstrated high antigenicity, solubility, and structural stability. In silico immune simulations showcased the MEV’s potential to elicit robust humoral and cell-mediated immune responses. Molecular docking studies revealed strong interactions between the MEV construct and Toll-Like Receptors (TLRs) and Major Histocompatibility Complex (MHC) molecules. Remarkably, the MEV–TLR-4 complexes exhibited a low energy score, high binding affinity, and a low dissociation constant. The Molecular Dynamic (MD) simulation analysis suggested that MEV–TLR-4 complexes had the highest stability and minimal conformational changes indicating equilibrium within 40 nanosecond time frames. Comprehensive computational analyses strongly support the potential of the proposed MEV to combat dental caries and associated infections. The study’s computational assays yielded promising results, but further validation through in vitro and in vivo experiments is needed to assess its efficacy and safety.},

 abstract = {COVID-19 is caused by SARS-CoV-2, several virulent variants of which have emerged since 2019. More than 529 million people have been infected, and at least 6 million have died. Our aim was to develop a fast, accurate, low-cost method for detecting and identifying newly emerging variants of concern (VOCs) that could pose a global threat. The 341-bp DNA sequence of a specific region of the SARS-CoV-2's spike protein was amplified by a one-step PCR on RNA samples from 46 patients. The product was sequenced using next-generation sequencing (NGS). DNA sequences from seven genomes, the original Wuhan isolate and six different representative variants obtained from the GISAID website, were used as references. Complete whole-genome sequences from local isolates were also obtained from the GISAID website, and their RNA was used for comparison. We used an amplicon-based NGS method (termed VOC-NGS) for genotyping and successfully identified all 46 samples. Fifteen (32.6\%) were like the original isolate. Twenty-seven were VOCs: nine (19.5\%) Alpha, eight (19\%) Delta, six (14\%) Beta, and four (8.7\%) Omicron. Two were variants of interest (VOI): one (2\%) Kappa and one (2\%) Zeta. Two samples were mixtures of two variants, one of Alpha and Beta and one of Alpha and Delta. The Spearman correlation between whole-genome sequencing (WGS) and VOC-NGS was significant (\textit{P} {\textless} 0.001) with perfect agreement (Kappa = 0.916) for 36/38 (94.7\%) samples with VOC-NGS detecting all the known VOCs. Genotyping by VOC-NGS enables rapid screening of high-throughput clinical samples that includes the identification of VOCs and mixtures of variants, at lower cost than WGS. \textbf{IMPORTANCE} The manuscript described SARS-Cov-2 genotyping by VOC-NGS, which presents an ideal balance of accuracy, rapidity, and cost for detecting and globally tracking VOCs and some VOI of SARS-CoV-2. A large number of clinical samples can be tested together. Rapid introduction of new mutations at a specific site of the spike protein necessitates efficient strain detection and identification to enable choice of treatment and the application of vaccination, as well as planning public health policy.},

This expansion has impacted transmission, disease severity, virulence, diagnosis, therapy, and natural and vaccine-induced immunity. Here, 183 whole genome sequences (WGS) were analyzed, of which 129 were from Palestinian cases, 62 of which were collected in 11 Palestinian districts between October 2020 and April 2021 and sequenced completely. A dramatic shift from the wild type to the Alpha variant (B 1.1.7) was observed within a short period of time. Cluster mapping revealed statistically significant clades in two main Palestinian cities, Al-Khalil (Monte Carlo hypothesis test-Poisson model, P = 0.00000000012) and Nablus (Monte Carlo hypothesis test-Poisson model, P = 0.014 and 0.015). The phylogenetic tree showed three main clusters of SARS-CoV-2 with high bootstrap values ({\textgreater}90). However, population genetics analysis showed a genetically homogenous population supported by low Wright's F-statistic values (Fst {\textless}0.25), high gene flow (Nm {\textgreater} 3), and statistically insignificant Tajima's D values (Tajima's test, neutrality model prediction, P = 0.02). The Alpha variant, rapidly replaced the wild type, causing a major surge that peaked in April 2021, with an increased COVID-19 mortality rate, especially, in the Al-Khalil and Nablus districts. The source of introduction remains uncertain, despite the minimal genetic variation. The study substantiates the use of WGS for SARS-CoV-2 surveillance as an early warning system to track down new variants requiring effective control.},

 abstract = {Abstract

Background
Food contamination by pathogens poses a global health threat, affecting an estimated 600 million people annually. During a foodborne outbreak investigation, microbiological analysis of food vehicles detects responsible pathogens and traces contamination sources. Metagenomic approaches offer a comprehensive view of the genomic composition of microbial communities, facilitating the detection of potential pathogens in samples. Combined with sequencing techniques like Oxford Nanopore sequencing, such metagenomic approaches become faster and easier to apply. A key limitation of these approaches is the lack of accessible, easy-to-use, and openly available pipelines for pathogen identification and tracking from (meta)genomic data.


Findings
PathoGFAIR is a collection of Galaxy-based Findable, Accessible, Interoperable, and Reusable (FAIR) workflows employing state-of-the-art tools to detect and track pathogens from metagenomic Nanopore sequencing. Although initially developed to detect pathogens in food datasets, the workflows can be applied to other metagenomic Nanopore pathogenic data. PathoGFAIR incorporates visualizations and reports for comprehensive results. We tested PathoGFAIR on 130 samples containing different pathogens from multiple hosts under various experimental conditions. For all but 1 sample, workflows have successfully detected expected pathogens at least at the species rank. Further taxonomic ranks are detected for samples with sufficiently high colony-forming unit and low cycle threshold values.


Conclusions
PathoGFAIR detects the pathogens at species and subspecies taxonomic ranks in all but 1 tested sample, regardless of whether the pathogen is isolated or the sample is incubated before sequencing. Importantly, PathoGFAIR is easy to use and can be straightforwardly adapted and extended for other types of analysis and sequencing techniques, making it usable in various pathogen detection scenarios.},

 abstract = {Glioblastoma (GBM) is one of the most aggressive and fatal cancers, for which Temozolomide (TMZ) chemo drug is commonly used for its treatment. However, patients gradually develop resistance to this drug, leading to tumor relapse. In our previous study, we have identified lncRNAs that regulate chemoresistance through the competing endogenous RNA (ceRNA) mechanism. In this study, we tried to find FDA-approved drugs against the target proteins of these ceRNA networks through drug repurposing using differential gene expression profiles, which could be used to nullify the effect of lncRNAs and promote the sensitivity of TMZ in GBM. We performed molecular docking and simulation studies of predicted repurposed drugs and their targets. Among the predicted repurposed drugs, we found BMS345541 has a higher binding affinity towards its target protein - FOXG1, making it a more stable complex with FOXG1-DNA. The ADMET analysis of this drug BMS345541 shows a higher half-life and lower cytotoxicity level than other predicted repurposed drugs. Hence, we conjecture that this could be a better drug for increasing the sensitivity of TMZ for treating GBM patients.},

Early detection of renal cell carcinoma (RCC) remains a challenge. Identification of novel biomarkers may improve the diagnosis, prognosis, and treatment of RCC. This study aimed to identify potential novel biomarkers for RCC by analyzing gene expression profiles by RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) and validating the results by laboratory tests.
Materials and methods
Data were retrieved from NCBI GEO datasets. After data processing and analysis, two genes with differential expression in RCC were selected: Slc15a3 and Myo1f. Blood samples were then collected from 26 RCC patients and 24 healthy controls. Following the extraction of RNA and the synthesis of cDNA, real-time polymerase chain reaction (PCR) was conducted. The expression of genes was evaluated and analyzed using GraphPad Prism, with a statistical significance threshold of P {\textless} 0.05.
Results
In silico analysis and RNA-seq data revealed that Slc15a3 and Myo1f were differentially expressed in RCC. Real-time PCR results showed a significant increase in Myo1f expression in RCC patients (P {\textless} 0.05), suggesting its potential as a novel biomarker. However, Slc15a3 did not show significant expression differences between RCC patients and controls (P {\textgreater} 0.05), indicating a limited biomarker potential.
Conclusion
This study suggests that Myo1f maybe a promising biomarker for RCC.},

However, resistance to paclitaxel remains one of the major causes of death associated with treatment failure. Multiple studies have demonstrated that miRNAs play a role in paclitaxel resistance and are associated with both disease progression and metastasis. In the present study, we used a miRNA-encoding lentiviral library as a gain-of-function screen for paclitaxel resistance in the MDA-MB-231 TNBC cell line. We identified that \textit{miR-181b}, \textit{miR-29a}, \textit{miR-30c}, \textit{miR-196} and \textit{miR-1295} conferred a resistant phenotype to cells. The expression of \textit{miR-29a} also induced resistance to eribulin and vinorelbine, while \textit{miR-181b} and \textit{miR-30c} induced resistance to vinorelbine. We measured the levels of these miRNAs in breast cancer patients and observed higher levels of \textit{miR-29a} in treatment-refractory patients. Taken together, we suggest that \textit{miR-29a} and \textit{miR-181b} may be good candidates for miRNA inhibition to overcome resistance to chemotherapy.},

@article{ngo_histone_2022,
 abstract = {Background

Epigenetic modulators have been proposed as promising new drug targets to treat adverse remodeling in heart failure. Here, we evaluated the potential of 4 epigenetic drugs, including the recently developed histone deacetylase 6 (HDAC6) inhibitor JS28, to prevent endothelin‐1 induced pathological gene expression in cardiac myocytes and analyzed the chromatin binding profile of the respective inhibitor targets.

Methods and Results

Cardiac myocytes were differentiated and puromycin‐selected from mouse embryonic stem cells and treated with endothelin‐1 to induce pathological gene expression (938 differentially expressed genes, q{\textless}0.05). Dysregulation of gene expression was at least in part prevented by epigenetic inhibitors, including the pan‐BRD (bromodomain‐containing protein) inhibitor bromosporine (290/938 genes), the BET (bromodomain and extraterminal) inhibitor JQ1 (288/938), the broad‐spectrum HDAC inhibitor suberoylanilide hydroxamic acid (227/938), and the HDAC6 inhibitor JS28 (210/938). Although the 4 compounds were similarly effective toward pathological gene expression, JS28 demonstrated the least adverse effects on physiological gene expression. Genome‐wide chromatin binding profiles revealed that HDAC6 binding sites were preferentially associated with promoters of genes involved in RNA processing. In contrast, BRD4 binding was associated with genes involved in core cardiac myocyte functions, for example, myocyte contractility, and showed enrichment at enhancers and intronic regions. These distinct chromatin binding profiles of HDAC6 and BRD4 might explain the different effects of their inhibitors on pathological versus physiological gene expression.

Conclusions

In summary, we demonstrated, that the HDAC6 inhibitor JS28 effectively prevented the adverse effects of endothelin‐1 on gene expression with minor impact on physiological gene expression in cardiac myocytes. Selective HDAC6 inhibition by JS28 appears to be a promising strategy for future evaluation in vivo and potential translation into clinical application.},

 abstract = {Previous studies have reported the functional role, biochemical features and synthesis pathway of podophyllotoxin (PTOX) in plants. In this study, we employed combined morphological and molecular techniques to identify an endophytic fungus and extract PTOX derivatives. Based on the analysis of ITS sequences and the phylogenetic tree, the isolate was classified as Penicillium herquei HGN12.1C, with a sequence identity of 98.58\%. Morphologically, the HGN12.1C strain exhibits white colonies, short-branched mycelia and densely packed hyphae. Using PacBio sequencing at an average read depth of 195×, we obtained a high-quality genome for the HGN12.1C strain, which is 34.9 Mb in size, containing eight chromosomes, one mitochondrial genome and a GC content of 46.5\%. Genome analysis revealed 10 genes potentially involved in PTOX biosynthesis. These genes include VdtD, Pinoresinollariciresinol reductase (PLR), Secoisolariciresinol dehydrogenase (SDH), CYP719A23, CYP71BE54, O-methyltransferase 1 (OMT1), O-methyltransferase 3 (OMT3), 2-ODD, CYP71CU and CYP82D61. Notably, the VdtD gene in fungi shares functional similarities with the DIR gene found in plants. Additionally, we identified peltatin, a PTOX derivative, in the HGN12.1C extract. Docking analysis suggests a potential role for the 2-ODD enzyme in converting yatein to deoxypodophyllotoxin. These findings offer invaluable insights into the synthesis mechanism of PTOX in fungi, shedding light on the relationship between host plants and endophytes.},

@misc{nguyen_single-vessel_2025,
 abstract = {Background Capillary malformation (CM) is a congenital vascular anomaly affecting the skin, mucosa, and brain, yet the understanding of its vascular pathogenesis remains limited.
Methods We applied spatial whole-transcriptome profiling (GeoMx) and gene set enrichment analysis within CM lesions at single vasculature level. Differentially expressed genes were validated by immunofluorescence staining. Phosphoproteomics was profiled to uncover lesion-wide phosphorylation sites on proteins. Single-cell RNA sequencing was performed on CM-derived induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) to determine differentiation trajectories of lesional vascular lineages. In silico gene perturbation was used to predict candidate genes for modulating vascular pathological progression, followed by functional validation in CM iPSC-derived endothelial cells (ECs) using a Tet-on system.
Results A spatial transcriptomic atlas was constructed, and pathological landscape of individual CM vasculature was delineated. CM vessels exhibited hallmarks of endothelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EndMT), including disruption of adherens junctions (AJs), vascular identity transitions, and metabolic remodeling. Phosphoproteomics confirmed that differentially phosphorylated proteins were enriched in EndMT- and AJ-related pathways. Aberrant expression of venous transcriptional factor NR2F2 was observed in lesional ECs and correlated with progressive enlargement from capillaries to larger-caliber vessels containing multiple layers of smooth muscle cells (SMCs). In CM iPSCs, differentiation course yielded reduced ECs but increased SMCs. In silico knockout simulation predicted NR2F2 as a crucial regulator of facilitating SMC phenotype in CM. Consistently, enforced NR2F2 expression during iPSC differentiation suppressed endothelial markers while inducing SMC-associated genes.
Conclusions Single CM vasculature displays pathological hallmarks characterized by EndMT and AJ disruption, leading to progressive vascular remodeling. NR2F2 functions as a central regulatory factor orchestrating the acquisition of the SMC phenotype, thereby representing a potential therapeutic target in CM.},

Here, we present a single-tube, bisulfite-free method for the simultaneous, genome-wide analysis of DNA methylation and genetic variants in single cells: epigenomics and genomics of single cells analyzed by restriction (epi-gSCAR). By applying this method, we obtained DNA methylation measurements of up to 506,063 CpGs and up to 1,244,188 single-nucleotide variants from single acute myeloid leukemia-derived cells. We demonstrate that epi-gSCAR generates accurate and reproducible measurements of DNA methylation and allows to differentiate between cell lines based on the DNA methylation and genetic profiles.},

 abstract = {Publishing supporting data significantly impacts researchers' productivity, especially in experiments requiring extensive tracking of data, processing steps, parameters, and outputs. A managed workflow environment, combined with RO-Crates, addresses these data management challenges. Workflows provide an alternative for handling complex data analyses by orchestrating various processing tools. The RO-Crate format, a community-driven proposal for packaging data, provenance, and workflows, facilitates publishing and reproducibility. The Galaxy workflow management system integrates workflows and RO-Crates, enabling the export of analyses, which can be shared and restored by other users. Using Galaxy, we demonstrate how to improve support for reproducibility. We tested our approach by designing an experiment using diverse supporting data from selected papers. In the experiment, we identified specific FAIRness and completeness issues hindering result reproduction, even when authors made significant efforts to document and publish their supporting data. In comparison, the proposed approach supports reproducibility by packaging datasets in RO-Crate format, streamlining the process. The Galaxy RO-Crates, published as supporting materials, enhance data sharing, transparency, and reproducibility, thus supporting the advancement of FAIR research practices in catalysis research.},

 abstract = {Emerging evidence supports the role of type 2 diabetes (T2D) mellitus as a risk factor for cancer progression. In this study, we investigated and identified biomarkers related to diabetes and pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) using systems biology to understand better the molecular landscape of PDAC and its connections with T2D.RNA-seq data related to blood samples of diabetes and pancreatic cancer were analyzed using bioinformatics tools in the Galaxy platform. After differential expression analysis using the DESeq2, the co-expression network associated with T2D and PDAC data was reconstructed using the WGCNA. Then, by visualizing the protein-protein interaction network in modules specifically related to T2D and PDAC, the key genes involved in these two diseases were identified, and their interaction network with long non-coding RNAs was reconstructed. Finally, the results of bioinformatics analysis were verified by qPCR in four groups, including T2D, PDAC, PDAC-T2D, and control groups.In this study, 1905 and 18,558 genes with significant differential expression were identified in the data of T2D and PDAC, respectively ({\textbar}logFC{\textbar} {\textgreater} 0.58, adj. p value {\textless} 0.05). The WGCNA showed 32 and 20 co-expression modules in diabetes and pancreatic cancer data, respectively. Among these, 303 genes were co-expressed, related to diabetes and pancreatic cancer. Based on the protein-protein interaction pattern, five hub genes were identified (using the CytoHubba Cytoscape plugin and the Maximal Clique Centrality (MCC) parameter). Finally, the co-expression network was reconstructed between these five genes and other lncRNAs. The qPCR showed that the expression of the CEBPZ gene was significantly increased in the blood samples of the diabetic (log2FC = 1.163, adj. p value = 0.0006), pancreatic cancer (log2FC = 3.22, adj. p value {\textless} 0.0001), and pancreatic cancer-diabetic (log2FC = 2.73, adj. p value {\textless} 0.0001) groups compared to the control group.For the first time, this study suggested that CEBPZ expression may serve as a diagnostic biomarker for assessing PDAC in individuals with T2D, given its differential expression in this specific cohort.},

@article{nogell_structure_2024,
 abstract = {The ribosomal DNA (rDNA), the most abundantly expressed locus in the human genome, is represented by hundreds of units per cell. Each unit includes a 13 kb region containing ribosomal RNA (rRNA) genes and a 30 kb intergenic spacer. The rDNA is transcribed with varying intensity in different units, some of which remain permanently silent. A key mediator of at least one of the silencing pathways is the promoter-associated RNA (pRNA) produced from a 2kb gene situated upstream of the rDNA transcription start site. Recent studies suggest that the sequence variability in mammalian cells may account for the selective transcription of different rDNA units. This thesis is based on the deep sequencing of a pRNA gene fragment and its RNA product. We discovered that a certain single- nucleotide variation, which converts the CCCmotif into CCT, as well as deletions reducing the number of CCCT tandem repeats, were significantly more frequent in the DNA than in the respective transcripts. The results suggest that DNA variations have a direct inhibitory effect on the expression of pRNA and,consequently, an indirect promoting effect on rRNA production. The findings also imply that (CCCT)n /(GGGA)n DNA repeats and the respective (GGGA)n RNA repeats may form triplex structures, facilitating the function of pRNA. Along...},

Mangiferin and related compounds have been found to modulate this system as determined by in silico and in vitro experimental procedures. ZINCPharmer was used to compile a library of over 1000 metabolites that were screened to the top five based on shared pharmacophores and drug-like properties with mangiferin. Molecular docking and molecular dynamics simulation (140 ns) showed that ZINC E (− 55.64 ± 2.93 kcal/mol) and ZINC D (− 54.51 ± 2.82 kcal/mol) had significantly lower binding free energy compared to mangiferin-LasR (− 42.24 ± 3.94 kcal/mol) and the reference standard (azithromycin-LasR (− 40.01 ± 6.15 kcal/mol). ZINC D (95.16\%) competed favorably with mangiferin (95.77\%) as potential QS modulators at sub-minimum inhibitory concentrations relative to ZINC E (85.07\%) and azithromycin (85.79\%). These observations suggest mangiferin and related lead compounds as potential drug candidates for P. aeruginosa infection management.},

 abstract = {Biodiversity and its associated genetic diversity are being lost at an unprecedented rate. Simultaneously, the distributions of flora, fauna, fungi, microbes and pathogens are rapidly changing. Novel technology can help to capture and record genetic diversity before it is lost and to measure population shifts and pathogen distributions. Here we report the rapid application of shotgun long-read environmental DNA (eDNA) analysis for non-invasive biodiversity, genetic diversity and pathogen assessments from air. We also compared air eDNA with water and soil eDNA. Coupling long-read sequencing with established cloud-based biodiversity pipelines enabled a 2-day turnaround from airborne sample collection to completed analysis by a single investigator. To determine the full utility of airborne eDNA, we also conducted a local bioinformatic analysis and deep short-read shotgun sequencing. From outdoor air eDNA alone, comprehensive genetic analysis was performed, including population genetics (phylogenetic placement) of a charismatic mammal (bobcat, Lynx rufus) and a venomous spider (golden silk orb weaver, Trichonephila clavipes), and haplotyping humans (Homo sapiens) from natural complex community settings, such as subtropical forests and temperate locations. The rich datasets also enabled deeper analysis of specific species and genomic regions of interest, including viral variant calling, human variant analysis and antimicrobial resistance gene surveillance from airborne DNA. Our results highlight the speed, versatility and specificity of pan-biodiversity monitoring via non-invasive eDNA sampling using current benchtop/portable and cloud-based approaches. Furthermore, they reveal the future feasibility of scaling down (equipment and temporally) these approaches for near real-time analysis. Together these approaches can enable rapid simultaneous detection of all life and its genetic diversity from air, water and sediment samples for unbiased non-targeted information-rich genomics-empowered (1) biodiversity monitoring, (2) population genetics, (3) pathogen and disease-vector genomic surveillance, (4) allergen and narcotic surveillance, (5) antimicrobial resistance surveillance and (6) bioprospecting.},

 abstract = {Sengon (Falcataria falcata) is an economically important legume tree widely cultivated in community forests, especially in Java Island. However, attacks of gall rust disease by Uromycladium falcatariae is difficult to manage. Understanding sengon genes expressions when artificially infected with gall rust fungi can help unravel its resistance mechanisms. Total RNA was extracted from sengon seedlings samples inoculated with U. falcatariae fungi at 7, 21, and 35 days after inoculation (DAI) and from the control group. Total RNA sequencing was performed using the PCR-cDNA Sequencing protocol (SQK-PCB109) from Oxford Nanopore Technologies. The RNA-Seq obtained varies from 1.3 million to 1.9 million total reads. The assembled full-length transcript was constructed using the RATTLE program, resulting in 21,819 transcripts. The TransDecoder program used to define open reading frames (ORFs) generated 2,342 transcripts, of which 34.15\% were 5′prime\_partial, 8.15\% were 3′prime\_partial, 8.5\% were internal, and 49.14\% were complete. Analysis of differentially expressed genes (DEGs) between resistant and susceptible seedlings, found that 1,013 genes that were up-regulated and 1,130 genes that were down-regulated in the resistant lines. The transcriptome data discussed in this article have been deposited in the DDBJ with accession number DRA015681.},

Putative circular RNA transcripts were decreased in platelets from septic patients. Leukocyte contamination defined by CD45 abundance levels in RNA-sequencing was absent in both groups. Principal component analysis of transcripts showed only partial overlap of clustering with IPF levels. RNA sequencing showed up-regulation of 524 and down-regulation of 118 genes in platelets from sepsis patients compared to controls.

 abstract = {The soil surrounding plant root harbors a diverse and dynamic microbial community that plays a crucial role in plant growth, health, and nutrient acquisition. This study was aimed at investigating the physicochemical properties and bacterial communities in healthy and infected root soil of plantain (Musa paradisiaca). The physicochemical properties of the soil samples were analyzed using the standard methods. The bacterial communities of the soil samples were determined by the conventional method and the 16S rRNA metagenomics. Both healthy and infected root soils had a pH of 6.18 and 5.56 respectively, and a temperature of 25.7 and 27.6oC respectively. The textural class of both soils is loamy sand. The particle size of healthy root soil (89.1 mg/kg), electrical conductivity (197 μS/cm), alkalinity (12.94 mg/l), organic matter (25.00 mg/l), nitrogen (1.183mg/l), iron (17.01mg/l), magnesium (0.602 mg/l), clay (68\%), coarse sand (2.09\%), fine sand (16.47\%), air porosity (61.41\%), and bulk density (0.803 g/cm3) in healthy root soil were higher than those of infected root soil. Cation exchange capacity (15.88 meq/100g), nitrate (0.731mg/l), phosphate (0.216mg/l), moisture (14.55wt\%), potassium (1.094 mg/l), calcium (0.213 mg/l), copper (0.093 mg/l), zinc (0.189 mg/l), manganese (0.017 mg/l), and silt (36.0 mg/l) were higher in infected than healthy root soil. The isolation and characterization of bacteria reveal 48 bacteria isolates from the healthy and infected root soils respectively, while 42 and 41 predominant fungal isolates were obtained from the healthy and infected root soils. All healthy and infected plantain root bacteria were taxonomically identified by amplifying and sequencing the 16S rRNA genes. A total of 33,198 bacterial taxonomic units comprising 6 phyla, 9 classes, 14 orders, 17 families, 15 genera, and 14 species, were generated from healthy root soil. In contrast, a total of 81,524 bacterial taxonomic units which consist of 11 phyla, 12 classes, 19 orders, 24 families, 31 genera, and 42 species, were generated from infected root soil. The analysis revealed significant differences in the composition and diversity of microbial communities between the two soil types, highlighting the potential role of soil microbiota in influencing the development and progression of Fusarium wilt.},

This study was aimed at investigating the bacterial communities in bulk and rhizosphere soil of Fusarium wilt-infected plantain (Musa paradisiaca). Physicochemical analysis revealed that electrical conductivity (312 µS/cm), cation exchange capacity (15.62 meq/100g), phosphate (0.16 mg/kg), nitrogen (1.53 mg/kg), moisture (19.45 mg/kg), potassium (1.39 mg/kg), magnesium (0.61 mg/kg), clay (60 \%), and silt (35\%) were higher in bulk soil than rhizosphere soil. The 16S rRNA metagenomic sequences quantified a total of 89341 bacterial taxonomic units from bulk soil which consist of 10 phyla, 13 classes, 16 orders, 18 families, 21 genera, and 19 species. A total of 88034 bacterial taxonomic units which comprised of 9 phyla, 13 classes, 23 orders, 22 families, 26 genera, and 25 species, were found in rhizosphere soil. The most abundant phyla in bulk soil are Actinobacteria (31\%), Proteobacteria (26\%), and Gemmatimonadetes (17\%) Acidobacteria (17\%) and Planctomycetes (3\%) while the prominent phyla in rhizosphere soil are Actinobacteria (63\%) Proteobacteria (24\%), Acidobacteria (7\%) and Planctomycetes (3\%). The major functional profiles of bacterial communities in both bulk and rhizosphere soils are metabolism of amino acids, carbohydrates, terpenoids, polyketides, cofactors, and xenobiotic degradation. Alpha diversities among the bacterial community were higher in Simpson’s reciprocal index for both bulk and rhizosphere soils. This study opens up new frontiers in expanding metagenomics studies on environmental samples which would capture and contribute to the identification of soil bacteria useful to ecosystem functions.},

This article presents to software engineering researchers the six key challenges that a domain expert faces in addressing their problem with a computational workflow, and the underlying executable implementation. These challenges arise out of our conceptual framework which presents the “route” of transformations that a domain expert may choose to take while developing their solution. To ground our conceptual framework in the state of the practice, this article discusses a selection of available textual and graphical workflow systems and their support for the transformations described in our framework. Example studies from the literature in various domains are also examined to highlight the tools used by the domain experts as well as a classification of the domain specificity and machine learning usage of their problem, workflow, and implementation. The state of the practice informs our discussion of the six key challenges, where we identify which challenges and transformations are not sufficiently addressed by available tools. We also suggest possible research directions for software engineering researchers to increase the automation of these tools and disseminate best-practice techniques between software engineering and various scientific domains.},

@article{oger_-cellspecific_2023,
 abstract = {The loss of pancreatic β-cell identity has emerged as an important feature of type 2 diabetes development, but the molecular mechanisms are still elusive. Here, we explore the cell-autonomous role of the cell-cycle regulator and transcription factor E2F1 in the maintenance of β-cell identity, insulin secretion, and glucose homeostasis. We show that the β-cell–specific loss of E2f1 function in mice triggers glucose intolerance associated with defective insulin secretion, altered endocrine cell mass, downregulation of many β-cell genes, and concomitant increase of non–β-cell markers. Mechanistically, epigenomic profiling of the promoters of these non–β-cell upregulated genes identified an enrichment of bivalent H3K4me3/H3K27me3 or H3K27me3 marks. Conversely, promoters of downregulated genes were enriched in active chromatin H3K4me3 and H3K27ac histone marks. We find that specific E2f1 transcriptional, cistromic, and epigenomic signatures are associated with these β-cell dysfunctions, with E2F1 directly regulating several β-cell genes at the chromatin level. Finally, the pharmacological inhibition of E2F transcriptional activity in human islets also impairs insulin secretion and the expression of β-cell identity genes. Our data suggest that E2F1 is critical for maintaining β-cell identity and function through sustained control of β-cell and non–β-cell transcriptional programs.β-Cell–specific E2f1 deficiency in mice impairs glucose tolerance.Loss of E2f1 function alters the ratio of α- to β-cells but does not trigger β-cell conversion into α-cells.Pharmacological inhibition of E2F activity inhibits glucose-stimulated insulin secretion and alters β- and α-cell gene expression in human islets.E2F1 maintains β-cell function and identity through control of transcriptomic and epigenetic programs.},

 abstract = {The use of insects to model molecular events that characterize degenerative conditions was originally met with scepticism. However, the discovery of insect insulin-like peptides in the 1970's and the demonstration of evolutionary conservation of insulin-related signalling from insects to mammals have highlighted the importance and reduced cost of insect models in biomedical research. Here, we expand on our earlier described modelling of streptozotocin-induced brain glucose metabolic disruption in Nauphoeta cinerea, using RNA-sequencing analysis to study the transcriptional and genetic signatures of degeneration and stress signalling when glucose levels are elevated in the brain of the lobster cockroach. Nymphs were randomly divided into three groups: Control (0.8\% NaCl), and two single streptozotocin injection doses (74 nmol and 740 nmol). The transcriptional analyses featured a dysregulation of 226 genes at high dose STZ treatment and 278 genes at the low dose. Our mRNA-sequencing data showed that ribosomal protein genes were the most upregulated genes at both 74 and 740 nmol STZ treatment. We therefore used RT-qPCR and relative transcriptional methods to validate our proposed mechanism of brain glucose toxicity-induced degeneration in Nauphoeta cinerea, which involved the upregulation of ribosomal proteins and rpS6 regulators (mTORC1, protein kinases, casein kinase 1 and Death-associated protein kinase), the upregulation of MAPK cascades (RAS, ERK, P38 and JNK), alongside the downregulation of the PI3K/AKT cascade. Taken together, this study highlights the remarkable opportunity for Nauphoeta cinerea use as an experimental organism in hyperglycaemia, degeneration, and stress signalling.},

 abstract = {The apoplast performs important functions in the plant, such as defense against stress, and compounds present form the apoplastic washing fluid (AWF). The fungus Moniliophthora perniciosa, the causal agent of witches' broom disease (WBD) in Theobroma cacao L., initially colonizes the apoplast in its biotrophic phase. In this period, the fungus can remain for approximately 60 days, until it changes to its second phase, causing tissue death and consequently large loss in the production of beans. To better understand the importance of the apoplast in the T. cacao-M. perniciosa interaction, we performed the first apoplastic proteomic mapping of two contrasting genotypes for WBD resistance (CCN51 - resistant and Catongo-susceptible). Based on two-dimensional gel analysis, we identified 36 proteins in CCN-51 and 15 in Catongo. We highlight PR-proteins, such as peroxidases, β-1, 3-glucanases and chitinases. A possible candidate for a resistance marker of the CCN-51 genotype, osmotin, was identified. The antioxidative metabolism of the superoxide dismutase (SOD) enzyme showed a significant increase (p{\textless}0.05) in the AWF of the two genotypes under field conditions (FD). T. cacao AWF inhibited the germination of M. perniciosa basidiospores ({\textgreater}80\%), in addition to causing morphological changes. Our results shed more light on the nature of the plant's defense performed by the apoplast in the T. cacao-M. perniciosa interaction in the initial (biotrophic) phase of fungal infection, and therefore make it possible to expand WBD control strategies based on the identification of potential targets for resistance markers and advance scientific knowledge of the disease.},

 abstract = {During the COVID-19 pandemic, RNA-seq datasets were produced to investigate the virus–host relationship. However, much of these data remains underexplored. To improve the search for molecular targets and biomarkers, we performed an integrated analysis of multiple RNA-seq datasets, expanding the cohort and including patients from different countries, encompassing severe and mild COVID-19 patients. Our analysis revealed that severe COVID-19 patients exhibit overexpression of genes coding for proteins of extracellular exosomes, endomembrane system, and neutrophil granules (e.g., S100A9, LY96, and RAB1B), which may play an essential role in the cellular response to infection. Concurrently, these patients exhibit down-regulation of genes encoding components of the T cell receptor complex and nucleolus, including TP53, IL2RB, and NCL. Finally, SPI1 may emerge as a central transcriptional factor associated with the up-regulated genes, whereas TP53, MYC, and MAX were associated with the down-regulated genes during COVID-19. This study identified targets and transcriptional factors, lighting on the molecular pathophysiology of syndrome coronavirus 2 infection.},

 abstract = {Fungi have the potential to colonize soybean seeds in the field, during their maturation in the pods and after harvest, during storage. The aim of this study was to identify fungi inhabiting soybean seeds after storage with varying germination capacity and to evaluate their chemical composition. The research material consisted of twelve soybean seed lots collected from the fields in southern Poland and stored over winter. The germination percentage of these lots ranged between 20.67\% and 81.33\%. The seeds were subjected to analyses of the main chemical components and mycological analysis. Fungal isolates were subjected to taxonomic identification using microscopic methods and DNA sequencing (using internal transcribed spacer region and secondary barcoding regions). A total number of 355 fungal isolates from 16 genera were identified, with Aspergillus, Alternaria, and Fusarium being the most common. Species were successfully identified in 94\% of isolates. Twelve examined seed lots varied significantly in the number of isolated fungal species (from 1 to 17). Moreover, they also differed in the isolated species composition. Highly significant positive correlation was found between the number of Aspergillus psedudoglaucus isolates and the content of free fatty acids. In turn, the number of Fusarium spp. isolates correlated negatively with protein and nitrogen content. Similarly, highly significant negative correlation was found between the number of all fungal isolates and the 1000-seed weight, indicating that smaller seeds are more vulnerable to fungal infection. The results obtained in this study identify species of fungi which may be responsible for lowering quality of the seeds obtained in southern Poland.},

The aim of this study was to compare the pathogenicity among different Fusarium isolates obtained from soybean plants with disease symptoms originating from an experimental field located in the southeast of Poland. Nineteen fungal isolates were selected for the pathogenicity assay, including eight isolates of F. oxysporum, six isolates of F. graminearum, four isolates of F. culmorum and one isolate of F. redolens. Species identification of these isolates was carried out using microscopic methods and sequencing of two genes: translation elongation factor 1-alpha (TEF1) and RNA polymerase second largest subunit (RPB2). To our knowledge, this is the first report of F. redolens being isolated from soybean in Europe. The pathogenicity test was set up by fungal inoculation of healthy soybean seeds of three cultivars: Abelina, Atlanta and Mavka. Symptoms were assessed seven days after inoculation. Disease area percentage of Fusarium inoculated seeds was significantly higher compared to uninoculated control. Nineteen isolates differed in their aggressiveness as the median disease area percentage ranged between 5.0 and 88.0\% depending on isolate. The obtained isolates of four Fusarium species may be used in the future screening of soybean cultivars for resistance to these pathogens.},

 abstract = {The Arabidopsis seor1ko line, which expresses the protein AtSEOR2 free of its bond with AtSEOR1, exhibits a lower phytoplasma titre as compared to wild type plants. In search for mechanism(s) underlying potential SEOR2-mediated defense responses the transcriptome of healthy wild type and Atseor1ko plants was disclosed by RNA sequencing. Comparative transcriptome analysis revealed 1036 differentially expressed genes (DEGs, 893 up- and 143 down-regulated) between the Atseor1ko line and the wild type. Sequence annotation and classification of the up-regulated genes identified “plant-pathogen interaction” among the most enriched clusters. The “plant-pathogen interaction” cluster included genes encoding members of the protein kinase superfamily, actors in calcium/calmodulin signaling transduction and WRKY transcription factors. An interaction network analysis and a host-phytoplasma interaction map demonstrated that AtSEOR2 protein could interact with the calcium-binding proteins CAM2 and TCH3. The latter one also turned out to be an indirect target of the SAP54CY phytoplasma effector, which suggests a SEOR2-mediated role of TCH3 in balancing nutrient investments in plant defense and plant growth.},

@article{oneill_inducible_2021,
 abstract = {\textbf{Background:} \textit{Chlamydia trachomatis} is a prolific human pathogen that can cause serious long-term conditions if left untreated. Recent developments in \textit{Chlamydia} genetics have opened the door to conducting targeted and random mutagenesis experiments to identify gene function. In the present study, an inducible transposon mutagenesis approach was developed for \textit{C. trachomatis} using a self-replicating vector to deliver the transposon-transposase cassette - a significant step towards our ultimate aim of achieving saturation mutagenesis of the \textit{Chlamydia} genome. \textbf{Methods:} The low transformation efficiency of \textit{C. trachomatis} necessitated the design of a self-replicating vector carrying the transposon mutagenesis cassette (i.e. the Himar-1 transposon containing the beta lactamase gene as well as a hyperactive transposase gene under inducible control of the \textit{tet} promoter system with the addition of a riboswitch). \textit{Chlamydia} transformed with this vector (pSW2-RiboA-C9Q) were induced at 24 hours post-infection. Through dual control of transcription and translation, basal expression of transposase was tightly regulated to stabilise the plasmid prior to transposition. \textbf{Results:} Here we present the preliminary sequencing results of transposon mutant pools of both \textit{C. trachomatis} biovars, using two plasmid-free representatives: urogenital strain   \textit{C. trachomatis} SWFP- and the lymphogranuloma venereum isolate L2(25667R). DNA sequencing libraries were generated and analysed using Oxford Nanopore Technologies' MinION technology. This enabled 'proof of concept' for the methods as an initial low-throughput screen of mutant libraries; the next step is to employ high throughput sequencing to assess saturation mutagenesis. \textbf{Conclusions:} This significant advance provides an efficient method for assaying \textit{C. trachomatis} gene function and will enable the identification of the essential gene set of \textit{C. trachomatis}.

@article{orwa_chaetomium_2025,
 abstract = {Late blight is a disease whose causative agent is the oomycete Phytophthora infestans. It is one of the most destructive pathogenic oomycetes and a major challenge to global tomato production. The pathogen is difficult to manage because of its ability to evolve thereby evading host resistance. The aim of this study was to screen for potential antagonists of P. infestans using a combination of culture and microbiome-based approaches. Samples were collected from healthy and P. infestans-infected tomato plants grown in soil collected from two organic tomato growers in the Rhine-Main area in Germany. A total of 246 fungal isolates were screened for their antagonistic activity against P. infestans. Most of the isolates that exhibited in vitro antagonistic activity were from the genera Penicillium, Trichoderma, Chlonostachys, Mortierella, and Pseudogymnoascus. Following a stepwise in vitro screening strategy that accounted for growth features, ecological aspects, taxonomic data, potential health risks, commercial properties, and antagonistic efficacy, five fungal isolates were eventually selected for plant trials. Chaetomium subaffine showed the highest inhibitory effect against P. infestans across three trials whereby the percentage of diseased leaf area reduced by 90\% compared to the control. Chlonostachys and Pseudogymnoascus spp. were effective in two trials, while Trichoderma and Ctenomyces spp. showed weak disease suppressive effects. In parallel, we characterized the fungal microbiome of the rhizosphere, phyllosphere, and endosphere from healthy and diseased tomato plants using ITS-rRNA sequencing. The fungal community differed significantly between the two soil origins, but P. infestans did not significantly influence fungal microbiota composition. Notably, 70\% of our antagonistic fungi from the culture collection were detected in the tomato microbiome. This work identified isolates of Chaetomium subaffine, Clonostachys sp., and Pseudogymnoascus sp. as potential biocontrol candidates promoting plant health. The findings highlight the importance of combined functional screening and microbiome profiling for identifying fungal antagonists.},

Therefore, to keep pace with the increasing drug resistance, there is a pressing need for novel antimicrobial agents, especially from non-conventional sources. Several natural products (NPs) have been shown to display promising in vitro activities against multidrug-resistant pathogens. Still, only a few of these compounds have been studied as prospective drug candidates. This may be due to the expensive and time-consuming process of conducting important studies on these compounds. The present review focuses on applying cheminformatics strategies to characterize, prioritize, and optimize NPs to develop new lead compounds against antimicrobial resistance pathogens. Moreover, case studies where these strategies have been used to identify potential drug candidates, including a few selected open-access tools commonly used for these studies, are briefly outlined.},

@article{ou_differences_2024,
 abstract = {Much of the profound interspecific variation in genome content has been attributed to transposable elements (TEs). To explore the extent of TE variation within species, we developed an optimized open-source algorithm, panEDTA, to de novo annotate TEs in a pangenome context. We then generated a unified TE annotation for a maize pangenome derived from 26 reference-quality genomes, which reveals an excess of 35.1 Mb of TE sequences per genome in tropical maize relative to temperate maize. A small number (n = 216) of TE families, mainly LTR retrotransposons, drive these differences. Evidence from the methylome, transcriptome, LTR age distribution, and LTR insertional polymorphisms reveals that 64.7\% of the variability is contributed by LTR families that are young, less methylated, and more expressed in tropical maize, whereas 18.5\% is driven by LTR families with removal or loss in temperate maize. Additionally, we find enrichment for Young LTR families adjacent to nucleotide-binding and leucine-rich repeat (NLR) clusters of varying copy number across lines, suggesting TE activity may be associated with disease resistance in maize.},

Vast amounts of sequence data can be generated in short periods of time. Regarding ophthalmology and vision research, extensive interrogation of patient samples for underlying causative DNA mutations has resulted in the discovery of many new genes relevant to eye disease. However, such analysis remains functionally limited. RNA-sequencing accurately snapshots thousands of genes, capturing many subtypes of RNA molecules, and has become the gold standard for transcriptome gene expression quantification. RNA-sequencing has the potential to advance our understanding of eye development and disease; it can reveal new candidates to improve our molecular diagnosis rates and highlight therapeutic targets for intervention. But with a wide range of applications, the design of such experiments can be problematic, no single optimal pipeline exists, and therefore, several considerations must be undertaken for optimal study design. We review the key steps involved in RNA-sequencing experimental design and the downstream bioinformatic pipelines used for differential gene expression. We provide guidance on the application of RNAsequencing to ophthalmology and sources of open-access eye-related data sets.},

In this study, bacterial communities and ARGs of raw (influent) and treated (effluent) sewage samples collected from a WWTP in Northern Mexico were studied using nanopore sequencing technology. Proteobacteria (52.56–61.50\%), Bacteroidetes (8.70–15.58\%), Actinobacteria (7.45–12.86\%), and Firmicutes (2.78–21.27\%) were the major phyla detected in all the sewage samples. The genus Arcobacter (15.36–29.11\%) dominated all the sewage samples, except in the effluent collected in 2022, where more abundance of the genus Shewanella (7.51\%) and Aeromonas (6.12\%) was observed. ARGs classes common to the samples include glycopeptide, bacitracin, macrolide, fluoroquinolone, peptide, tetracycline, and phenicol. The members of the clinically relevant ESKAPE (Enterococcus faecium, Staphylococcus aureus, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Acinetobacter baumannii, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and Enterobacter spp.) group, Escherichia coli, Eubacterium rectale, and Acinetobacter johnsonii with mobile genetic elements carrying ARGs were among the potential human pathogens detected in effluent samples. The release of effluents containing these bacteria or their genomes into the natural environment could have public health implications and aid the spread of ARGs. Better policies and enhanced wastewater treatment strategies are necessary to reduce or eliminate these risks.},

@article{ozaki_novel_2020,
 abstract = {Cell division requires proper spatial coordination with the chromosome, which undergoes dynamic changes during chromosome replication and segregation. FtsZ is a bacterial cytoskeletal protein that assembles into the Z-ring, providing a platform to build the cell division apparatus. In the model bacterium \textit{Caulobacter crescentus}, the cellular localization of the Z-ring is controlled during the cell cycle in a chromosome replication-coupled manner. Although dynamic localization of the Z-ring at midcell is driven primarily by the replication origin-associated FtsZ inhibitor MipZ, the mechanism ensuring accurate positioning of the Z-ring remains unclear. In this study, we showed that the Z-ring colocalizes with the replication terminus region, located opposite the origin, throughout most of the \textit{C. crescentus} cell cycle. Spatial organization of the two is mediated by ZapT, a previously uncharacterized protein that interacts with the terminus region and associates with ZapA and ZauP, both of which are part of the incipient division apparatus. While the Z-ring and the terminus region coincided with the presence of ZapT, colocalization of the two was perturbed in cells lacking \textit{zapT}, which is accompanied by delayed midcellular positioning of the Z-ring. Moreover, cells overexpressing ZapT showed compromised positioning of the Z-ring and MipZ. These findings underscore the important role of ZapT in controlling cell division processes. We propose that ZapT acts as a molecular bridge that physically links the terminus region to the Z-ring, thereby ensuring accurate site selection for the Z-ring. Because ZapT is conserved in proteobacteria, these findings may define a general mechanism coordinating cell division with chromosome organization.\textbf{IMPORTANCE} Growing bacteria require careful tuning of cell division processes with dynamic organization of replicating chromosomes. In enteric bacteria, ZapA associates with the cytoskeletal Z-ring and establishes a physical linkage to the chromosomal replication terminus through its interaction with ZapB-MatP-DNA complexes. However, because ZapB and MatP are found only in enteric bacteria, it remains unclear how the Z-ring and the terminus are coordinated in the vast majority of bacteria. Here, we provide evidence that a novel conserved protein, termed ZapT, mediates colocalization of the Z-ring with the terminus in \textit{Caulobacter crescentus}, a model organism that is phylogenetically distant from enteric bacteria. Given that ZapT facilitates cell division processes in \textit{C. crescentus}, this study highlights the universal importance of the physical linkage between the Z-ring and the terminus in maintaining cell integrity.},

Currently, there is limited information about the genetic background of carbapenem and colistin-resistant K. pneumoniae isolates infecting humans and dogs in Thailand. This study aimed to characterize carbapenem and colistin-resistant genes in six resistant K. pneumoniae clinical isolates (three from humans and three from dogs) which differed in their pulse field gel electrophoresis profiles. Matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization-time of flight mass spectrometry (MALDI-TOF MS), antimicrobial susceptibility testing, and whole-genome sequencing were employed to identify and analyze the isolates. All six isolates were carbapenemase-producing K. pneumoniae isolates with chromosomally carried blaSHV, fosA, oqxA and oqxB genes, as well as nine to 21 virulence genes. The isolates belonged to five multilocus sequence types (STs): one isolate from a human and one from a dog belonged to ST16, with the other two human isolates being from ST340 and ST1269 and the other two dog isolates were ST147 and ST15. One human isolate and two dog isolates harbored the same blaOXA-232 gene on the ColKP3 plasmid, and one dog isolate carried the blaOXA-48 gene on the IncFII plasmid. Notably, one human isolate exhibited resistance to colistin mediated by the mcr-3.5 gene carried on the IncFII plasmid, which co-existed with resistance determinants to other antibiotics, including aminoglycosides and quinolones. In conclusion, this study provides a comprehensive characterization of both chromosome- and plasmid-mediated carbapenem and colistin resistance in a set of K. pneumoniae clinical isolates from unrelated humans and dogs in Thailand. The similarities and differences found contribute to our understanding of the potential widescale dissemination of these important resistance genes among clinical isolates from humans and animals, which in turn may contribute to outbreaks of emerging resistant clones in hospital settings.},

 abstract = {The goliath grouper \textit{Epinephelus itajara} (Perciformes: Epinephelidae) is a large, critically endangered fish distributed across coastal habitats in the western Atlantic Ocean, from Florida to southern Brazil, and with additional populations in the eastern Pacific basin. Conservation concerns for this species stem from historical overfishing, habitat loss, and life-history traits such as slow growth and late sexual maturity. In this study, to aid conservation efforts, we assembled and characterized the complete mitochondrial genome of \textit{E. itajara}. The mitochondrial genome of \textit{Epinephelus itajara} is 16,561 bp long and comprises 13 protein-coding genes (PCGs), two ribosomal RNA genes (12S and 16S rRNA), 22 transfer RNA (tRNA) genes, and an 856 bp control region. Gene order is identical to that reported for other congeneric species. The overall A + T content is 56\%, and codon usage shows a preference for A + T-rich codons. All PCGs were found to be under purifying selection, with variation in selective pressure among genes; \textit{cox1} and \textit{nad4} were under the strongest and weakest selection, respectively. Secondary structure analysis of the tRNA genes displayed typical cloverleaf secondary structures, except for trnS1, which lacked a complete D-arm. Comparative analyses between MiTFi and RASP2 revealed that MiTFi provided more accurate predictions of tRNA secondary structures. The control region exhibited a high A + T content (69.9\%), multiple microsatellite motifs, and one tandem repeat, along with hairpin secondary structures. These features mirror findings in closely related species. A maximum likelihood phylogenetic analysis based on translated PCGs did not support the monophyletic status of the genus \textit{Epinephelus} and indicated a sister relationship between \textit{Epinephelus itajara} and \textit{Epinephelus lanceolatus}, another large-bodied grouper from the Indo-Pacific Ocean. The newly sequenced mitochondrial genome of \textit{Epinephelus itajara} provides a new genomic resource that can support future conservation efforts.},

With this study, we describe FP and the associated chelonid alphaherpesvirus 5 (ChHV5) in Kemp's ridley turtles encountered in the United States during 2006-2020. Analysis of 22 case reports of Kemp's ridley turtles with FP revealed that while the disease was mild in most cases, 54.5\% were adult turtles, a reproductively valuable age class whose survival is a priority for population recovery. Of 51 blood samples from tumor-free turtles and 12 tumor samples from turtles with FP, 7.8\% and 91.7\%, respectively, tested positive for ChHV5 DNA via quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qPCR). Viral genome shotgun sequencing and phylogenetic analysis of six tumor samples show that ChHV5 sequences in Kemp's ridley turtles encountered in the Gulf of Mexico and northwestern Atlantic cluster with ChHV5 sequences identified in green (\textit{Chelonia mydas}) and loggerhead (\textit{Caretta caretta}) sea turtles from Hawaii, the southwestern Atlantic Ocean, and the Caribbean. Results suggest an interspecific, spatiotemporal spread of FP among Kemp's ridley turtles in regions where the disease is enzootic. Although FP is currently uncommon in this species, it remains a health concern due to its uncertain pathogenesis and potential relationship with habitat degradation.},

PG and spore cortex of \textit{C. difficile} cells were largely unaffected by the deletion of the three predicted LDTs, revealing the implication of a new family of LDTs. The d,d-carboxypeptidases producing the essential LDT substrate were inactivated by cephalosporins, resulting in the inhibition of the l,d-transpeptidation pathway. In contrast, the participation of penicillin-binding proteins (PBPs) to PG cross-linking increased in the presence of the antibiotics. Our findings highlight that cephalosporin resistance is not primarily mediated by LDTs and illustrate the plasticity of the PG biosynthesis machinery in \textit{C. difficile}.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

 abstract = {Worldwide, bacterial resistance is one of the most severe public health problems. Currently, the failure of antibiotics to counteract superbugs highlights the need to search for new molecules with antimicrobial potential to combat them. The objective of this research was to evaluate the antimicrobial activity of Bacillus amyloliquefaciens BS4 against Gram-negative bacteria. Thirty yeasts and thirty-two Bacillus isolates were tested following the agar well-diffusion method. Four Bacillus sp. strains (BS3, BS4, BS17, and BS21) showed antagonistic activity against E. coli ATCC 25922 using bacterial culture (BC) and the cell-free supernatant (CFS), where the BS4 strain stood out, showing inhibitory values of 20.50 ± 0.70 mm and 19.67 ± 0.58 mm for BC and CFS, respectively. The Bacillus sp. BS4 strain can produce antioxidant, non-hemolytic, and antimicrobial metabolites that exhibit activity against several microorganisms such as Salmonella enterica, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Shigella flexneri, Enterobacter aerogenes, Proteus vulgaris, Yersinia enterocolitica, Serratia marcescens, Aeromonas sp., Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Candida albicans, and Candida tropicalis. According to the characterization of the supernatant, the metabolites could be proteinaceous. The production of these metabolites is influenced by carbon and nitrogen sources. The most suitable medium to produce antimicrobial metabolites was TSB broth. The one-factor-at-a-time method was used to standardize parameters such as pH, agitation, temperature, carbon source, nitrogen source, and salts, resulting in the best conditions of pH 7, 150 rpm, 28 °C, starch (2.5 g/L), tryptone (20 g/L), and magnesium sulfate (0.2 g/L), respectively. Moreover, the co-culture was an excellent strategy to improve antimicrobial activity, achieving maximum antimicrobial activity with an inhibition zone of 21.85 ± 1.03 mm. These findings position the Bacillus amyloliquefaciens BS4 strain as a promising candidate for producing bioactive molecules with potential applications in human health.},

 abstract = {Cancer progression is often accompanied with the acquisition of functional anergy by natural killer (NK) cells and their aging. As a result, persistent herpesviruses, such as hCMV and EBV, reactivate. The catalytic subunit of telomerase encoded by hTERT gene may enhance functional and proliferative activity. We aimed to elucidate if NK cells modified for sustained hTERT expression acquire these beneficial characteristics. We examined the proliferative and functional activities of hTERT-NK cells and combined observations with RNA-seq results. Thus, hTERT-NK cells were characterized with an increase in the expression levels of cell cycle genes and better proliferative activity in the third month after isolation. Increased degranulation upon K562 target cell recognition simultaneously with a higher expression level of granzyme B was observed for hTERT-NK cells. An increased level of IFNγ was also noted in hTERT-NK cells. These results reveal that hTERT-NK cells obtain additional advantages due to the stable hTERT expression. hTERT-NK cells are likely to perform high levels of functional activity over long time periods that are commonly needed during cancer treatment to perform immune surveillance and minimize relapse rates.},

 abstract = {Stomatopods are well studied for their unique visual systems, which can consist of up to 16 different photoreceptor types and 33 opsin proteins expressed in the adults of some species. The light-sensing abilities of larval stomatopods are comparatively less well understood with limited information about the opsin repertoire of these early-life stages. Early work has suggested that larval stomatopods may not possess the extensive light detection abilities found in their adult counterparts. However, recent studies have shown that these larvae may have more complex photosensory systems than previously thought. To examine this idea at the molecular level, we characterized the expression of putative light-absorbing opsins across developmental stages, from embryo to adult, in the stomatopod species Pullosquilla thomassini using transcriptomic methods with a special focus on ecological and physiological transition periods. Opsin expression during the transition from the larval to the adult stage was further characterized in the species Gonodactylaceus falcatus. Opsin transcripts from short, middle, and long wavelength-sensitive clades were found in both species, and analysis of spectral tuning sites suggested differences in absorbance within these clades. This is the first study to document the changes in opsin repertoire across development in stomatopods, providing novel evidence for light detection across the visual spectrum in larvae.},

 abstract = {Investigations of the molecular mechanisms behind detection of short, and particularly ultraviolet, wavelengths in arthropods have relied heavily on studies from insects due to the relative ease of heterologous expression of modified opsin proteins in model organisms like Drosophila. However, species outside of the Insecta can provide information on mechanisms for spectral tuning as well as the evolutionary history of pancrustacean visual pigments. Here we investigate the basis of spectral tuning in malacostracan short wavelength sensitive (SWS) opsins using phylogenetic comparative methods. Tuning sites that may be responsible for the difference between ultraviolet (UV) and violet visual pigment absorbance in the Malacostraca are identified, and the idea that an amino acid polymorphism at a single site is responsible for this shift is shown to be unlikely. Instead, we suggest that this change in absorbance is accomplished through multiple amino acid substitutions. On the basis of our findings, we conducted further surveys to identify spectral tuning mechanisms in the order Stomatopoda where duplication of UV opsins has occurred. Ancestral state reconstructions of stomatopod opsins from two main clades provide insight into the amino acid changes that lead to differing absorption by the visual pigments they form, and likely contribute the basis for the wide array of UV spectral sensitivities found in this order.},

 abstract = {Plasmid-mediated dissemination of antibiotic resistance among fecal \textit{Enterobacteriaceae} in natural ecosystems may contribute to the persistence of antibiotic resistance genes in anthropogenically impacted environments. Plasmid transfer frequencies measured under laboratory conditions might lead to overestimation of plasmid transfer potential in natural ecosystems. This study assessed differences in the conjugative transfer of an IncP-1 (pKJK5) plasmid to three natural \textit{Escherichia coli} strains carrying extended-spectrum beta-lactamases, by filter mating. Matings were performed under optimal laboratory conditions (rich LB medium and 37°C) and environmentally relevant temperatures (25, 15 and 9°C) or nutrient regimes mimicking environmental conditions and limitations (synthetic wastewater and soil extract). Under optimal nutrient conditions and temperature, two recipients yielded high transfer frequencies (5 × 10$^{\textrm{-1}}$) while the conjugation frequency of the third strain was 1000-fold lower. Decreasing mating temperatures to psychrophilic ranges led to lower transfer frequencies, albeit all three strains conjugated under all the tested temperatures. Low nutritive media caused significant decreases in transconjugants (-3 logs for synthetic wastewater; -6 logs for soil extract), where only one of the strains was able to produce detectable transconjugants. Collectively, this study highlights that despite less-than-optimal conditions, fecal organisms may transfer plasmids in the environment, but the transfer of pKJK5 between microorganisms is limited mainly by low nutrient conditions.},

The recently proposed semi-supervised binning method, SemiBin, achieved state-of-the-art binning results in several environments. However, this required annotating contigs, a computationally costly and potentially biased process.We propose SemiBin2, which uses self-supervised learning to learn feature embeddings from the contigs. In simulated and real datasets, we show that self-supervised learning achieves better results than the semi-supervised learning used in SemiBin1 and that SemiBin2 outperforms other state-of-the-art binners. Compared to SemiBin1, SemiBin2 can reconstruct 8.3–21.5\% more high-quality bins and requires only 25\% of the running time and 11\% of peak memory usage in real short-read sequencing samples. To extend SemiBin2 to long-read data, we also propose ensemble-based DBSCAN clustering algorithm, resulting in 13.1–26.3\% more high-quality genomes than the second best binner for long-read data.SemiBin2 is available as open source software at https://github.com/BigDataBiology/SemiBin/ and the analysis scripts used in the study can be found at https://github.com/BigDataBiology/SemiBin2\_benchmark.},

 abstract = {African swine fever virus (ASFV) is a lethal animal pathogen that enters its host cells through endocytosis. So far, host factors specifically required for ASFV replication have been barely identified. In this study a genome-wide CRISPR/Cas9 knockout screen in porcine cells indicated that the genes RFXANK, RFXAP, SLA-DMA, SLA-DMB, and CIITA are important for productive ASFV infection. The proteins encoded by these genes belong to the major histocompatibility complex II (MHC II), or swine leucocyte antigen complex II (SLA II). RFXAP and CIITA are MHC II-specific transcription factors, whereas SLA-DMA/B are subunits of the non-classical MHC II molecule SLA-DM. Targeted knockout of either of these genes led to severe replication defects of different ASFV isolates, reflected by substantially reduced plating efficiency, cell-to-cell spread, progeny virus titers and viral DNA replication. Transgene-based reconstitution of SLA-DMA/B fully restored the replication capacity demonstrating that SLA-DM, which resides in late endosomes, plays a crucial role during early steps of ASFV infection.},

FXR occupied substantially more DNA binding sites in individuals with obesity, and FXR activation by OCA robustly changed the transcriptional output. Integration of ChIP-seq and RNA-seq data showed that mitochondrial function and substrate oxidation were the top metabolic pathways selectively modulated by FXR activation in individuals with obesity. FXR activation restored compromised substrate oxidation by enhancing β-oxidation and oxidative phosphorylation along with antagonizing ROS production. In line with this, the amount of reduced glutathione in patients with obesity normalized after OCA treatment. In summary, FXR signaling profoundly differs in patients with obesity, consisting of changes in DNA binding profiles and transcriptional programs, which enhance energy substrate utilization in this patient cohort.},

In the current study, we examined these biomarkers in circulating tumor cells (CTCs) and plasma-derived exosomes from 100 treatment-naïve SCLC patients. CTCs were analyzed using the VyCAP system, whereas exosomes were characterized molecularly and transcriptomically. JUNB, CXCR4, and PD-L1 were highly prevalent in CTCs. Patients exhibited significantly increased protein exosomal expression of JUNB and CXCR4 compared to healthy individuals. Overexpression of JUNB and CXCR4 in exosomes can distinguish patients from normal donors, offering an interesting tool for early diagnosis. The presence of JUNB and/or CXCR4 in CTCs correlated with significantly poorer overall survival. CXCR4 exosomal overexpression was associated with CTC presence and their phenotypes. Conclusively, a comprehensive analysis of CTCs and exosomes provides useful prognostic and potential diagnostic tools for SCLC patients.},

Here we report a MAU2 variant causing CdLS, a deletion of seven amino acids that impairs the interaction between MAU2 and the NIPBL N terminus. Investigating this interaction, we discovered that MAU2 and the NIPBL N terminus are largely dispensable for normal cohesin and NIPBL function in cells with a NIPBL early truncating mutation. Despite a predicted fatal outcome of an out-of-frame single nucleotide duplication in NIPBL, engineered in two different cell lines, alternative translation initiation yields a form of NIPBL missing N-terminal residues. This form cannot interact with MAU2, but binds DNA and mediates cohesin loading. Altogether, our work reveals that cohesin loading can occur independently of functional NIPBL/MAU2 complexes and highlights a novel mechanism protective against out-of-frame mutations that is potentially relevant for other genetic conditions.},

 abstract = {Blowflies (Calliphoridae) represent a species-rich group, comprising 9 \% of calyptrate diversity and 1.3 \% of all described Diptera. The blowfly subfamily Calliphorinae, is known for its species of medical, veterinary and forensic importance, which has led to a skew toward these species in publicly available mitochondrial genome data. This skew leaves a significant proportion of this subfamily unrepresented and has resulted in poorly understood inter- and intra-subfamilial relationships, due to restricted taxon sampling. To address this, we assembled mitogenomes for 63 Calliphorinae species across 13 genera and a further 15 species from all remaining calliphorid subfamilies, representing the most comprehensive mitogenomic dataset for blowflies to date. Comparative analysis of mitochondrial DNA revealed structural and functional variations in gene order, base composition, codon usage, evolutionary rates and gene rearrangements across blowfly lineages, including a major rearrangement in Calliphora varifrons. Phylogenetic analysis of 13 mitochondrial protein-coding genes strongly supported the monophyly of Calliphoridae and its subfamilies. Clades Chrysomyinae (Calliphorinae+Luciliinae) and Rhiniinae+Bengaliinae are well-supported, with former subfamilies Melanomyinae and Toxotarsinae nested within Calliphorinae. Ameniinae was paraphyletic in most analyses, with variable placement of Eurychaeta palpalis. Genera Calliphora and Onesia are non-monophyletic, and the synonymisation of Calliphora with Cynomya, Cyanus and Cynomyiomima is suggested.},

 abstract = {Garden cress (Lepidium sativum L.) is a Brassicaceae crop recognized as a healthy vegetable and a medicinal plant. Lepidium is one of the largest genera in Brassicaceae, yet, the genus has not been a focus of extensive genomic research. In the present work, garden cress genome was sequenced using the long read high-fidelity sequencing technology. A de novo, draft genome assembly that spans 336.5 Mb was produced, corresponding to 88.6\% of the estimated genome size and representing 90\% of the evolutionarily expected orthologous gene content. Protein coding gene content was structurally predicted and functionally annotated, resulting in the identification of 25,668 putative genes. A total of 599 candidate disease resistance genes were identified by predicting resistance gene domains in gene structures, and 37 genes were detected as orthologs of heavy metal associated protein coding genes. In addition, 4289 genes were assigned as “transcription factor coding.” Six different machine learning algorithms were trained and tested for their performance in classifying miRNA coding genomic sequences. Logistic regression proved the best performing trained algorithm, thus utilized for pre-miRNA coding loci identification in the assembly. Repetitive DNA analysis involved the characterization of transposable element and microsatellite contents. L. sativum chloroplast genome was also assembled and functionally annotated. Data produced in the present work is expected to constitute a foundation for genomic research in garden cress and contribute to genomics-assisted crop improvement and genome evolution studies in the Brassicaceae family.},

This thesis aims to answer that question by taking advantage of available transcriptomic datasets (Alyagor et al. 2018; Li et al. 2020; Li et al. 2017; Xie et al. 2021) and focusing on the possible role of cell surface molecules in circuit assembly by means of RNAi-mediated knockdown in the PNs and KC. The effect of the knockdown was analysed by measuring number and distribution of PN boutons, calyx organisation and synapse formation. Based on this primary RNAi screen, candidate molecules that displayed circuit defects in the calyx were isolated and examined for the pattern of expression, the mutant phenotype and its cell autonomy in order to elucidate the role the molecules play in the development of the calyx. In addition, a method for in vivo imaging of the pupa was developed to be able to image developmental milestones in the context of normal development as well as mutants.{\textless}br /{\textgreater}

The mitochondrial DNA of sponges overall present several divergences from other metazoans, and while presenting unique features among major transitions, such as in calcarean and glass sponges, poriferan mitogenomes are relatively stable within their groups. Here, we report and discuss the mitogenome of Lycopodina hypogea (Vacelet \& Boury-Esnault, 1996), which greatly vary from its subordinal counterparts in both structure and gene order. This mitogenome is seemingly multipartite into three chromosomes, two of them as microDNAs. The main chromosome, chrM1, is unusually large, 31,099 bp in length, has a unique gene order within Poecilosclerida, and presents two rRNA, 13 protein and 19 tRNA coding genes. Intergenic regions comprise approximately 40\% of chrM1, bearing several terminal direct and inverted repeats (TDRr and TIRs) but holding no vestiges of former mitochondrial sequences, pseudogenes, or transposable elements. The nd4l and trnI(gau) genes are likely located in microDNAs thus comprising putative mitochondrial chromosomes chrM2, 291 bp, and chrM3, 140 bp, respectively. It is unclear which processes are responsible for the remarkable features of the of L. hypogea mitogenome, including a generalized gene rearrangement, long IGRs, and putative extrachromosomal genes in microDNAs.},

A significant failure rate of current treatments indicates the need for novel treatment targets. Animal models are crucial in this process, but current diabetic retinopathy models do not develop RNV. Although the nondiabetic oxygen-induced retinopathy (OIR) mouse model is used to study RNV development, it is largely unknown how closely it resembles human PDR.    We therefore performed RNA sequencing on murine (C57BL/6J) OIR retinas (n = 14) and human PDR RNV membranes (n = 7) extracted during vitrectomy, each with reference to control tissue (n=13/10). Differentially expressed genes (DEG) and associated biological processes were analyzed and compared between human and murine RNV to assess molecular overlap and identify phylogenetically conserved factors.    In total, 213 murine- and 1223 human-specific factors were upregulated with a small overlap of 94 DEG (7\% of human DEG), although similar biological processes such as angiogenesis, regulation of immune response, and extracellular matrix organization were activated in both species. Phylogenetically conserved mediators included ANGPT2, S100A8, MCAM, EDNRA, and CCR7.    Even though few individual genes were upregulated simultaneously in both species, similar biological processes appeared to be activated. These findings demonstrate the potential and limitations of the OIR model to study human PDR and identify phylogenetically conserved potential treatment targets for PDR.},

This study investigated the association of azoospermia factor (AZF) region microdeletions with unsuccessful assisted reproductive techniques (ART), including in vitro fertilization (IVF) and intracytoplasmic sperm injection (ICSI).This cross-sectional analysis study examined 80 Iranian oligospermic men (mean age 34 years) with prior failed ICSI and IVF cycles (IR.IAU.TNB.REC.1401.041). Semen analysis evaluated quantity/quality parameters based on World Health Organization guidelines. Participants were stratified by sperm DNA fragmentation (SDF) levels into: control (SDF \&lt; 15\%, n = 20), mild elevation (15\% ≤ SDF ≤ 30\%, n = 60), and high (SDF \&gt; 30\%, n = 20). Multiplex PCR mapped AZF microdeletions in the high SDF group. The AZF-associated genes were selected by RNA Seq analysis, and the candidate genes were checked for expression level by real-time PCR.High SDF individuals exhibited poorer semen metrics, including 69\% lower sperm concentration (P = 0.04) than those without SDF. Of this subset, 45\% (9/20 men) harboured predominately AZF microdeletions. Men with AZF microdeletions showed higher SDF (32\% vs 21\%, P = 0.02) and altered AZF-associated genes expression. As USP9Y 3-fold, UTY 1.3-fold, and BPY2 1-fold revealed up-regulation, while IQCF1 8-fold, CDY 6.5-fold, DAZ 6-fold, and DDX3Y 1-fold underwent down-regulation. The PAWP gene was also down-regulated (5.7-fold, P = 0.029) in the IVF/ICSI failure group.AZF microdeletions significantly impact male infertility and ART outcomes. High SDF individuals exhibited poorer semen metrics, with 45\% AZF microdeletions. These microdeletions altered AZF-associated genes expression, affecting fertility mediator PAWP independently. Dual AZF and SDF screening enables personalized management in severe male infertility, potentially explaining IVF/ICSI failures.},

 abstract = {Non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) patients are often elderly or unfit and thus cannot tolerate standard aggressive therapy regimes. In our study, we test the efficacy of the DNA-hypomethylating agent decitabine (DAC) in combination with all-trans retinoic acid (ATRA), which has been shown to possess little systemic adverse effects. Screening a broad panel of 56 NSCLC cell lines uncovered a decrease in cell viability after the combination treatment in 77\% of the cell lines. Transcriptomics, proteomics, proliferation and migration profiling revealed that fast proliferating and slowly migrating cell lines were more sensitive to the drug combination. The comparison of mutational profiles found oncogenic KRAS mutations only in sensitive cells. Additionally, different cell lines showed a heterogeneous gene expression response to the treatment pointing to diverse mechanisms of action. Silencing KRAS, RIG-I or RARB partially reversed the sensitivity of KRAS-mutant NCI-H460 cells. To study resistance, we generated two NCI-H460 cell populations resistant to ATRA and DAC, which migrated faster and proliferated slower than the parental sensitive cells and showed signs of senescence. In summary, this comprehensive dataset uncovers a broad sensitivity of NSCLC cells to the combinatorial treatment with DAC and ATRA and indicates that migration and proliferation capacities correlate with and could thus serve as determinants for drug sensitivity in NSCLC.},

 abstract = {Ribosome assembly is a multistep process that ensures a functional ribosome structure. The molecular mechanism that ribosome­associated GTPases (RA­GTPases) use to enhance ribosome assembly accuracy remains largely to be elucidated. Here, we use systematic evolution of ligands by exponential enrichment (SELEX), followed by sequencing, comprehensive bioinformatics analysis, and biochemical characterization to identify aptamers that target the RA-GTPase ERA of Staphylococcus aureus. ELONA and thermophoresis assays show that the AptERA 2 interaction with ERA is in the 200 nM range of affinity, displays a high level of specificity, and depends on the target structure. Docking to ERA suggests that AptERA 2 interacts with the protein’s KH domain, consistent with the aptamer’s similarities with helix 45 of the 16S rRNA. AptERA 2 did interact with the isolated KH domain but did not bind to the ∆KH ERA nor to the similar RA-GTPase RbgA, which shares the GTPase core but lacks the KH domain, confirming that the aptamer recognizes and binds the KH domain of ERA. This interaction leads to a significant reduction of 30S-dependent GTP hydrolysis, indicative of allosteric modulation of the enzyme activity or limiting ERA binding or the KH domain interaction with the 3’ end of the 16S rRNA rather than directly blocking GTP binding. Altogether, this work highlights the versatility of aptamers as tools to understand the complex processes of ribosome biogenesis further, offering new insights into bacterial protein synthesis mechanisms.},

We investigated the antirickettsial effect of hydrophilic and hydrophobic CQDs against Rickettsia slovaca, a tick-borne bacterial pathogen. Photodynamic activity against on rickettsiae reached 99.66\% using CQDs with 470 nm blue light irradiation. Combining methylene blue with CQDs further enhanced the effect on rickettsial infection, achieving 99,98\% efficacy. The obtained results reveal the in vitro antirickettsial properties of CQDs.

Hepatocyte lipotoxicity is one of the main pathogenic factors of liver fibrosis and NASH. However, the molecular mechanisms regulating this process are poorly understood. The main aim of this study was to dissect transcriptional mechanisms regulated by lipotoxicity in hepatocytes. We achieved this aim by combining transcriptomic, proteomic and chromatin accessibility analyses from human liver and mouse hepatocytes. This integrative approach revealed several transcription factor networks deregulated by NASH and lipotoxicity. To validate these predictions, genetic deletion of the transcription factors MAFK and TCF4 was performed, resulting in hepatocytes that were better protected against saturated fatty acid oversupply. MAFK- and TCF4-regulated gene expression profiles suggest a mitigating effect against cell stress, while promoting cell survival and growth. Moreover, in the context of lipotoxicity, some MAFK and TCF4 target genes were to the corresponding differentially regulated transcripts in human liver fibrosis. Collectively, our findings comprehensively profile the transcriptional response to lipotoxicity in hepatocytes, revealing new molecular insights and providing a valuable resource for future endeavours to tackle the molecular mechanisms of NASH.},

The peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor γ coactivator 1α (PGC-1α) is a prototypical master regulator of adaptive transcription in various cell types. We now uncovered a central function of the C-terminal domain of PGC-1α to bind RNAs and assemble multiprotein complexes including proteins that control gene transcription and RNA processing. These interactions are important for PGC-1α recruitment to chromatin in transcriptionally active liquid-like nuclear condensates. Notably, such a compartmentalization of active transcription mediated by liquid-liquid phase separation was observed in mouse and human skeletal muscle, revealing a mechanism by which PGC-1α regulates complex transcriptional networks. These findings provide a broad conceptual framework for context-dependent transcriptional control of phenotypic adaptations in metabolically active tissues.},

To study the specific role of H3K4me3 demethylation, we investigated neurodevelopmental phenotypes in mice without KDM5B demethylase activity. These mice exhibited autism-like behaviours and increased brain size. H3K4me3 levels and the expression of neurodevelopmental genes were increased in the developing Kdm5b mutant neocortex. These included elevated expression of Grin2d . The Grin2d gene product NMDAR2D was increased in synaptosomes isolated from the Kdm5b -deficient neocortex and treating mice with the NMDAR antagonist memantine rescued deficits in ultrasonic vocalisations and reduced repetitive digging behaviours. These findings suggest that increased H3K4me3 levels and associated Grin2d gene upregulation disrupt brain development and function, leading to socio-communication deficits and repetitive behaviours, and identify a potential therapeutic target for neurodevelopmental disorders associated with KDM5B deficiency.},

 abstract = {The histone lysine demethylase KDM5B is implicated in recessive intellectual disability disorders, and heterozygous, protein-truncating variants in KDM5B are associated with reduced cognitive function in the population. The KDM5 family of lysine demethylases has developmental and homeostatic functions in the brain, some of which appear to be independent of lysine demethylase activity. To determine the functions of KDM5B in hippocampus-dependent learning and memory, we first studied male and female mice homozygous for a Kdm5bΔARID allele that lacks demethylase activity. Kdm5bΔARID/ΔARID mice exhibited hyperactivity and long-term memory deficits in hippocampus-dependent learning tasks. The expression of immediate early, activity-dependent genes was downregulated in these mice and hyperactivated upon a learning stimulus compared with wild-type (WT) mice. A number of other learning-associated genes were also significantly dysregulated in the Kdm5bΔARID/ΔARID hippocampus. Next, we knocked down Kdm5b specifically in the adult, WT mouse hippocampus with shRNA. Kdm5b knockdown resulted in spontaneous seizures, hyperactivity, and hippocampus-dependent long-term memory and long-term potentiation deficits. These findings identify KDM5B as a critical regulator of gene expression and synaptic plasticity in the adult hippocampus and suggest that at least some of the cognitive phenotypes associated with KDM5B gene variants are caused by direct effects on memory consolidation mechanisms.},

 abstract = {Within ovarian cancer research, patient-derived xenograft (PDX) models recapitulate histologic features and genomic aberrations found in original tumors. However, conflicting data from published studies have demonstrated significant transcriptional differences between PDXs and original tumors, challenging the fidelity of these models. We employed a quantitative mass spectrometry-based proteomic approach coupled with generation of patient-specific databases using RNA-seq data to investigate the proteogenomic landscape of serially-passaged PDX models established from two patients with distinct subtypes of ovarian cancer. We demonstrate that the utilization of patient-specific databases guided by transcriptional profiles increases the depth of human protein identification in PDX models. Our data show that human proteomes of serially passaged PDXs differ significantly from their patient-derived tumor of origin. Analysis of differentially abundant proteins revealed enrichment of distinct biological pathways with major downregulated processes including extracellular matrix organization and the immune system. Finally, we investigated the relative abundances of ovarian cancer-related proteins identified from the Cancer Gene Census across serially passaged PDXs, and found their protein levels to be unstable across PDX models. Our findings highlight features of distinct and dynamic proteomes of serially-passaged PDX models of ovarian cancer.},

 abstract = {The recent improvements in mass spectrometry instruments and new analytical methods are increasing the intersection between proteomics and big data science. In addition, bioinformatics analysis is becoming increasingly complex and convoluted, involving multiple algorithms and tools. A wide variety of methods and software tools have been developed for computational proteomics and metabolomics during recent years, and this trend is likely to continue. However, most of the computational proteomics and metabolomics tools are designed as single-tiered software application where the analytics tasks can't be distributed, limiting the scalability and reproducibility of the data analysis. In this paper we summarise the key steps of metabolomics and proteomics data processing, including the main tools and software used to perform the data analysis. We discuss the combination of software containers with workflows environments for large scale metabolomics and proteomics analysis. Finally, we introduce to the proteomics and metabolomics communities a new approach for reproducible and large-scale data analysis based on BioContainers and two of the most popular workflow environments: Galaxy and Nextflow.

 abstract = {Metastasierung und Therapieresistenz stellen die wesentlichen Hindernisse bei der kurativen Behandlung des Kolorektalkarzinoms (KRK) dar und sind Hauptursache für die krebsbedingte Sterblichkeit. Bei etwa einem Viertel der KRK-Patient*innen liegen bei Erstdiagnose Fernmetastasen vor, bei ca. der Hälfte der Erkrankten treten im Verlauf Fernmetastasen auf (Kumbrink et al., 2021; Van Cutsem \& Oliveira, 2009; Vatandoust et al., 2015). 
Fluoropyrimidin-basierte Chemotherapieregime sind das Grundgerüst der systemischen KRK-Therapie, welche durch weitere klassische Zytostatika sowie Antikörper-basierte Wirkstoffe erweitert werden kann. Das Kombinationsschema bestehend aus 5-Fluoruracil, Irinotecan und Leucovorin – syn. FOLFIRI – wird bei metastasiertem KRK (mKRK) als Erst- oder Zweitlinientherapie eingesetzt (Leitlinienprogramm Onkologie (Deutsche Krebsgesellschaft, 2019). Trotz der Wirksamkeit dieser Kombinationsbehandlung, durch die die Überlebensrate deutlich verbessert werden konnte, führen intrinsische und erworbene Resistenzmechanismen zur Progression der Krankheit (Jensen et al., 2015; Lyskjær et al., 2019).

Um molekularen Mechanismen und Biomarker der FOLFIRI-Resistenz auf Transkriptomebene zu identifizieren, wurden aus den KRK -Zelllinien Colo205, HT29 und SW480 drei FOLFIRI-resistente Subzelllinien durch kontinuierliche Behandlung mit steigenden FOLFIRI-Konzentrationen hergestellt. Als biologische Effekte der FOLFIRI-Resistenz konnten Änderungen in der Genexpression, morphologische Veränderungen sowie Anpassung des Zellzyklus und Zelltod-Resistenz beobachtet werden. 

Zur Identifikation von resistenz-assoziierten Expressionssignaturen oder potentiell prognostischen Biomarkern wurde eine RNA-Sequenzierung der parentalen sowie der resistenten Zelllinien durchgeführt. 
Insgesamt 284 differentiell exprimierte Gene (DEGs) wurden nach der bioinformatischen Analyse der RNA-Sequenzierung von 24 Proben ermittelt (Colo205: 222 Gene, HT29: 47 Gene, SW480: 30 Gene). Anschließend wurden diese DEGs miteinander abgeglichen und 12 DEGs identifiziert, die in zwei oder allen drei Zelllinien konsistent dysreguliert waren. Mittels Kaplan-Meier (KM-) Überlebenszeitanalyse des Kolon-Adenokarzinom-Datensatz (COAD) des Krebsgenomatlas (The Cancer Genome Atlas, TCGA, PanCancer Atlas Datenset ) wurden hieraus drei prognostisch relevante Gene (TACSTD2, PERP und CAV2) identifiziert, die sich signifikant mit kürzerem Überleben bei KRK assoziiert zeigten. 
Diese Ergebnisse wurden mit den Ergebnissen einer klinischen Studie (GSE62322) abgeglichen. In dieser Studie wurden von 21 Chemotherapie-naiven KRK-Patient*innen Tumorproben entnommen, worauf eine postoperative Chemotherapie mit FOLFIRI folgte. Um eine Gensignatur zu identifizieren, die das Ansprechen auf FOLFIRI vorhersagen soll, wurden im nächsten Schritt die Expressionsdaten der auf FOLFIRI ansprechenden Patient*innen mit denen der nicht auf FOLFIRI ansprechenden Patient*innen verglichen. 
Im Abgleich mit diesen Expressionsdaten konnten die drei Gene TACSTD2, PERP und CAV2 nicht als signifikant dysreguliert bzw. als Teil der Gensignatur nachgewiesen werden. Jedoch konnten die Gene SERPINE2 und TNC aus der Liste aller 284 DEGs in den klinischen Tumorproben ebenfalls als signifikant differentiell exprimiert nachgewiesen werden und mittels KM-Überlebenszeitanalyse als prognostisch relevant eingestuft werden. 
Diese drei bzw. fünf identifizierten Gene können nun Grundlage für weitere experimentelle Schritte sein, um neue diagnostische und prognostische Biomarker für die klinische Praxis zu etablieren.},

 abstract = {Noncommunicable diseases (NCDs) account for over 70\% of deaths world-wide. Previous work has linked NCDs such as type 2 diabetes (T2D) to disruption of chromatin regulators. However, the exact molecular origins of these chronic conditions remain elusive. Here, we identify the H4 lysine 16 acetyltransferase MOF as a critical regulator of central carbon metabolism. High-throughput metabolomics unveil a systemic amino acid and carbohydrate imbalance in Mof deficient mice, manifesting in T2D predisposition. Oral glucose tolerance testing (OGTT) reveals defects in glucose assimilation and insulin secretion in these animals. Furthermore, Mof deficient mice are resistant to diet-induced fat gain due to defects in glucose uptake in adipose tissue. MOF-mediated H4K16ac deposition controls expression of the master regulator of glucose metabolism, Pparg and the entire downstream transcriptional network. Glucose uptake and lipid storage can be reconstituted in MOF-depleted adipocytes in vitro by ectopic Glut4 expression, PPARγ agonist thiazolidinedione (TZD) treatment or SIRT1 inhibition. Hence, chronic imbalance in H4K16ac promotes a destabilisation of metabolism triggering the development of a metabolic disorder, and its maintenance provides an unprecedented regulatory epigenetic mechanism controlling diet-induced obesity.},

 abstract = {Chronic diseases affecting the central nervous system (CNS) like Alzheimer's or Parkinson's disease typically develop with advanced chronological age. Yet, aging at the metabolic level has been explored only sporadically in humans using biofluids in close proximity to the CNS such as the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF). We have used an untargeted liquid chromatography high-resolution mass spectrometry (LC-HRMS) based metabolomics approach to measure the levels of metabolites in the CSF of non-neurological control subjects in the age of 20 up to 74. Using a random forest-based feature selection strategy, we extracted 69 features that were strongly related to age (p$_{\textrm{age}}$ {\textless} 0.001, r$_{\textrm{age}}$ = 0.762, R$^{\textrm{2}}$$_{\textrm{Boruta age}}$ = 0.764). Combining an in-house library of known substances with in silico chemical classification and functional semantic annotation we successfully assigned putative annotations to 59 out of the 69 CSF metabolites. We found alterations in metabolites related to the Cytochrome P450 system, perturbations in the tryptophan and kynurenine pathways, metabolites associated with cellular energy (NAD+, ADP), mitochondrial and ribosomal metabolisms, neurological dysfunction, and an increase of adverse microbial metabolites. Taken together our results point at a key role for metabolites found in CSF related to the Cytochrome P450 system as most often associated with metabolic aging.},

 abstract = {Transcription-associated proteins (TAPs) fulfill multiple functions in regulatory and developmental processes and display lineage-specific evolution. TAPscan is a comprehensive and highly reliable tool for genome-wide TAP annotation via domain profiles. Here, we present TAPscan v4, including an updated web interface (https://tapscan.plantcode.cup.uni-freiburg.de/), which enables an in-depth representation of the distribution of 138 TAP families across 678 species from diverse groups of organisms, with a focus on Archaeplastida (plants in the wide sense). With this release, we also make the underlying “Genome Zoo” available, a curated protein data set with scripts and metadata. Eighteen new TAP (sub)families were added as part of the update. Nine of those were gained in the most recent common ancestor of the Streptophyta (comprising streptophyte algae and land plants), or within the streptophyte algae. More than one-third of all detected TAP family gains were identified during the evolution of streptophyte algae, before the emergence of land plants, and are thus likely to have been significant for plant terrestrialization. The TAP complement of the Zygnematophyceae was identified to be the most similar to that of land plants, consistent with the finding that this lineage is sister to land plants. Overall, our data retrace the evolution of streptophyte TAPs, allowing us to pinpoint the regulatory repertoire of the earliest land plants.},

 abstract = {Despite substantial heterogeneity of studies, there is evidence that antibiotics commonly used in primary care influence the composition of the gastrointestinal microbiota in terms of changing their composition and/or diversity. Benzyl isothiocyanate (BITC) from the food and medicinal plant nasturtium (Tropaeolum majus) is known for its antimicrobial activity and is used for the treatment of infections of the draining urinary tract and upper respiratory tract. Against this background, we raised the question of whether a 14 d nasturtium intervention (3 g daily, N = 30 healthy females) could also impact the normal gut microbiota composition. Spot urinary BITC excretion highly correlated with a weak but significant antibacterial effect against Escherichia coli. A significant increase in human beta defensin 1 as a parameter for host defense was seen in urine and exhaled breath condensate (EBC) upon verum intervention. Pre-to-post analysis revealed that mean gut microbiome composition did not significantly differ between groups, nor did the circulating serum metabolome. On an individual level, some large changes were observed between sampling points, however. Explorative Spearman rank correlation analysis in subgroups revealed associations between gut microbiota and the circulating metabolome, as well as between changes in blood markers and bacterial gut species.},

 abstract = {Cerebral cavernous malformations (CCMs) are anomalies of the cerebral vasculature. Loss of the CCM proteins CCM1/KRIT1, CCM2, or CCM3/PDCD10 trigger a MAPK-Krüppel-like factor 2 (KLF2) signaling cascade, which induces a pathophysiological pattern of gene expression. The downstream target genes that are activated by KLF2 are mostly unknown. Here we show that Chromobox Protein Homolog 7 (CBX7), component of the Polycomb Repressive Complex 1, contributes to pathophysiological KLF2 signaling during zebrafish cardiovascular development. CBX7/cbx7a mRNA is strongly upregulated in lesions of CCM patients, and in human, mouse, and zebrafish CCM-deficient endothelial cells. The silencing or pharmacological inhibition of CBX7/Cbx7a suppresses pathological CCM phenotypes in ccm2 zebrafish, CCM2-deficient HUVECs, and in a pre-clinical murine CCM3 disease model. Whole-transcriptome datasets from zebrafish cardiovascular tissues and human endothelial cells reveal a role of CBX7/Cbx7a in the activation of KLF2 target genes including TEK, ANGPT1, WNT9, and endoMT-associated genes. Our findings uncover an intricate interplay in the regulation of Klf2-dependent biomechanical signaling by CBX7 in CCM. This work also provides insights for therapeutic strategies in the pathogenesis of CCM.},

 abstract = {Background: There is a growing body of evidence on the potential involvement of coagulase-negative Staphylococci (CoNS) in causing urinary tract infections (UTIs). The aim of this study was to delineate virulence potential, antimicrobial resistance genes, and sequence types of CoNS isolated from patients with UTI symptoms and pyuria in Tanzania. Methods: CoNS from patients with UTI symptoms and more than 125 leucocytes/μL were retrieved, subcultured, and whole-genome sequenced. Results: Out of 65 CoNS isolates, 8 species of CoNS were identified; Staphylococcus haemolyticus, n = 27 (41.5\%), and Staphylococcus epidermidis, n = 24 (36.9\%), were predominant. The majority of S. haemolyticus were sequence type (ST) 30, with 8 new ST138-145 reported, while the majority of S. epidermidis were typed as ST490 with 7 new ST1184-1190 reported. Sixty isolates (92.3\%) had either one or multiple antimicrobial resistance genes. The most frequently detected resistance genes were 53 (21\%) dfrG, 32 (12.9\%) blaZ, and 26 (10.5\%) mecA genes conferring resistance to trimethoprim, penicillin, and methicillin, respectively. Out of 65 isolates, 59 (90.8\%) had virulence genes associated with UTI, with a predominance of the icaC 47 (46.5\%) and icaA 14 (13.9\%) genes. Conclusion:S. haemolyticus and S. epidermidis harboring icaC, dfrG, blaZ, and mecA genes were the predominant CoNS causing UTI in Tanzania. Laboratories should carefully interpret the significant bacteriuria due to CoNS in relation to UTI symptoms and pyuria before labeling them as contaminants. Follow-up studies to document the outcome of the treated patients is needed to add more evidence that CoNS are UTI pathogens.},

 abstract = {In Thailand, small- to medium-scale (SM) dairy farms typically have fewer than 100 cows. They are often family-owned or independently operated, and vary in infrastructure and mechanization depending on their size. In contrast, large-scale (L) farms, with more than 100 cows, are more industrialized, utilizing advanced technology, higher production systems, and usually employ multiple workers. To date, few studies have reported the prevalence of methicillin-resistant staphylococci (MRS) and methicillin-susceptible staphylococci (MSS) and their antimicrobial resistance (AMR) at different farm scales. This study aimed to investigate the prevalence of Staphylococcus spp., MRS, MSS and their AMR as well as their genetic backgrounds on SM and L dairy farms in Thailand. A total of 157 mastitis milk samples were collected from 106 cows on 42 SM farms, and 65 samples from 37 cows on one L farm, all located in Kanchanaburi Province. Antimicrobial susceptibility testing was conducted by determining the minimum inhibitory concentration. Whole-genome sequencing and analysis were performed for genetic characterization. There was a significant difference in the prevalence of Staphylococcus spp. on L farm (26.2\%) and SM farms (14\%) (P = 0.031, χ² test). The phenotypic resistance of trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole in L farm (58.8\%) was significantly greater than that in SM farms (27.3\%) (P = 0.049, χ² test). Six methicillin-resistant staphylococci (27.3\%), including Staph. haemolyticus sequence type (ST) 3 (N=1) and ST42 (N=3) and Staph. epidermidis ST59 (N=2) were discovered on SM farms, whereas a single Staph. aureus ST398 (5.9\%, N=1) was found on an L farm. These strains were multidrug-resistant and carried multiple, diverse antimicrobial resistance genes, including β-lactam resistance genes (mecA, blaZ), tetracycline resistance genes [tet(K), tet(M)], and macrolide resistance genes [msr(A), mph(C)]. Compared with MRS, MSS carried fewer diverse antimicrobial resistance genes and had distinct STs at both farm scales. At each farm scale, a particular type of resistance may originate from a certain species or specific ST. In conclusion, the prevalence of Staphylococcus spp. and their resistance traits and genetic background on SM and L farms differ according to different production farm scales. The specific management and monitoring of the information on Staphylococcus spp. circulated on each farm type could help to limit the spread of antimicrobial-resistant staphylococci.},

 abstract = {\textit{Shigella flexneri} is a major health burden in low- and middle-income countries, where it is a leading cause of mortality associated with diarrhoea in children, and shows an increasing incidence among travellers and men having sex with men. Like all \textit{Shigella} spp., \textit{S. flexneri} has evolved from commensal \textit{Escherichia coli} following the acquisition of a large plasmid pINV, which contains genes essential for virulence. Current sequence typing schemes of \textit{Shigella} are based on combinations of chromosomal genetic loci, since pINV-encoded virulence genes are often lost during growth in the laboratory, making these elements inappropriate for sequence typing. By performing comparative analysis of pINVs from \textit{S. flexneri} strains isolated from different geographical regions and belonging to different serotypes, we found that in contrast to plasmid-encoded virulence genes, plasmid maintenance genes are highly stable pINV-encoded elements. For the first time, to our knowledge, we have developed a \textit{S. flexneri} plasmid multilocus sequence typing (pMLST) method based on different combinations of alleles of the \textit{vapBC} and \textit{yacAB} toxin-antitoxin (TA) systems, and the \textit{parAB} partitioning system. This enables typing of \textit{S. flexneri} pINV plasmids into distinct 'virulence sequence types' (vSTs). Furthermore, the phylogenies of vST alleles and bacterial host core genomes suggests an intimate co-evolution of pINV with the chromosome of its bacterial host, consistent with previous findings. This work demonstrates the potential of plasmid maintenance loci as genetic characteristics to study as well as to trace the molecular phylogenesis of \textit{S. flexneri} pINV and the phylogenetic relationship of this plasmid with its bacterial host.},

None of the species in this genus have their mitochondrial genome described, which is highly valuable in phylogenetic and molecular evolution studies. For the present work, eight species from the Neoarius genus were selected: Neoarius utarus, Neoarius midgleyi, Neoarius graeffei, Neoarius leptaspis, Neoarius berenyi, Neoarius paucus, Neoarius pectoralis, and Neoarius aff. graeffei. DNA sequences of the eight species were obtained through the NCBI Sequence Read Archive (SRA) database, and the mitochondrial genomes were assembled using the NOVOplasty tool on the Galaxy platform, subsequently annotated with the MitoAnnotator tool. We then utilized the protein-coding genes from the mitogenomes to estimate the phylogenetic relationships within the group, including seven additional mitogenomes available in the NCBI. In all species, the mitochondrial genomes presented 13 protein-coding genes, 2 rRNA genes, 22 tRNA genes, and 1 D-loop.},

@article{pinter_functional_2021,
 abstract = {The lysine specific demethylase 1 (LSD1) plays a pivotal role in cellular differentiation by regulating the expression of key developmental genes in concert with different coregulatory proteins. This process is impaired in different cancer types and incompletely understood. To comprehensively identify functional coregulators of LSD1, we established a novel tractable fluorescent reporter system to monitor LSD1 activity in living cells. Combining this reporter system with a state-of-the-art multiplexed RNAi screen, we identify the DEAD-box helicase 19A (DDX19A) as a novel coregulator and demonstrate that suppression of Ddx19a results in an increase of R-loops and reduced LSD1-mediated gene silencing. We further show that DDX19A binds to tri-methylated lysine 27 of histone 3 (H3K27me3) and it regulates gene expression through the removal of transcription promoting R-loops. Our results uncover a novel transcriptional regulatory cascade where the downregulation of genes is dependent on the LSD1 mediated demethylation of histone H3 lysine 4 (H3K4). This allows the polycomb repressive complex 2 (PRC2) to methylate H3K27, which serves as a binding site for DDX19A. Finally, the binding of DDX19A leads to the efficient removal of R-loops at active promoters, which further de-represses LSD1 and PRC2, establishing a positive feedback loop leading to a robust repression of the target gene.},

 abstract = {Epidemiological surveillance of animal tuberculosis (TB) based on whole genome sequencing (WGS) of Mycobacterium bovis has recently gained track due to its high resolution to identify infection sources, characterize the pathogen population structure, and facilitate contact tracing. However, the workflow from bacterial isolation to sequence data analysis has several technical challenges that may severely impact the power to understand the epidemiological scenario and inform outbreak response. While trying to use archived DNA from cultured samples obtained during routine official surveillance of animal TB in Portugal, we struggled against three major challenges: the low amount of M. bovis DNA obtained from routinely processed animal samples; the lack of purity of M. bovis DNA, i.e., high levels of contamination with DNA from other organisms; and the co-occurrence of more than one M. bovis strain per sample (within-host mixed infection). The loss of isolated genomes generates missed links in transmission chain reconstruction, hampering the biological and epidemiological interpretation of data as a whole. Upon identification of these challenges, we implemented an integrated solution framework based on whole genome amplification and a dedicated computational pipeline to minimize their effects and recover as many genomes as possible. With the approaches described herein, we were able to recover 62 out of 100 samples that would have otherwise been lost. Based on these results, we discuss adjustments that should be made in official and research laboratories to facilitate the sequential implementation of bacteriological culture, PCR, downstream genomics, and computational-based methods. All of this in a time frame supporting data-driven intervention.},

Here we present the outcomes of a retrospective observational analysis of the first 100 consecutive cases of personalized BT of difficult-to-treat infections facilitated by a Belgian consortium in 35 hospitals, 29 cities and 12 countries during the period from 1 January 2008 to 30 April 2022. We assessed how often personalized BT produced a positive clinical outcome (general efficacy) and performed a regression analysis to identify functional relationships. The most common indications were lower respiratory tract, skin and soft tissue, and bone infections, and involved combinations of 26 bacteriophages and 6 defined bacteriophage cocktails, individually selected and sometimes pre-adapted to target the causative bacterial pathogens. Clinical improvement and eradication of the targeted bacteria were reported for 77.2\% and 61.3\% of infections, respectively. In our dataset of 100 cases, eradication was 70\% less probable when no concomitant antibiotics were used (odds ratio = 0.3; 95\% confidence interval = 0.127–0.749). In vivo selection of bacteriophage resistance and in vitro bacteriophage–antibiotic synergy were documented in 43.8\% (7/16 patients) and 90\% (9/10) of evaluated patients, respectively. We observed a combination of antibiotic re-sensitization and reduced virulence in bacteriophage-resistant bacterial isolates that emerged during BT. Bacteriophage immune neutralization was observed in 38.5\% (5/13) of screened patients. Fifteen adverse events were reported, including seven non-serious adverse drug reactions suspected to be linked to BT. While our analysis is limited by the uncontrolled nature of these data, it indicates that BT can be effective in combination with antibiotics and can inform the design of future controlled clinical trials.

This paper aims to investigate the role of LMCO1 in oxidative degradation of polyethylene, through comprehensive examination that includes machine learning analysis, recombinant expression, biochemical and biological assays. To do so, the available RNA-seq data related to Rhodococcus opacus R7 grown on PE was analysed using several attribute weighting algorithms to explore the discriminative role of LMCO1 in PE degradation. Further, the recombinant LMCO1 was evaluated and found to have a substantial degrading impact on the polyethylene films. The findings indicated that Cu²⁺ increased the activity of LMCO1 in the crude extract by 490\%, with peak activity occurring at a pH of 8 and an optimal temperature of 60°C. Oxidative degradation of PE samples was evaluated by measuring loss weight rate, assessment of water contact angle measuring, Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy and scanning electron microscopy analysis. The findings from the polyethylene degradation experiments conducted over 72 hours indicated that a weight loss rate of 17.11\% was observed in polyethylene, accompanied by a reduction in the water contact angle to 74.22°C. Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy analysis revealed the existence of various polar functional groups on the surface of polyethylene, such as carbonyl, carboxyl, and hydroxyl groups. Significant damage to the polyethylene surface, including cracks, pitting, and roughness, as well as internal aspects such as structural weakening and material degradation, was identified through scanning electron microscopy. Overall, this study presented the high potential of LMCO1 to degrade polyethylene film and particle in short time.},

 abstract = {Within a citizen science project, 112 freshwater habitats in Austria were sampled to get bacterial cultures belonging to the genus Aquirufa using a strategy for targeted isolation. We focused on these bacteria because they are widespread and represent typical freshwater bacteria and, furthermore, the typic red pigmentation facilitates preselection. Among the 113 obtained Aquirufa strains were HETE-83DT, KTFRIE-69FT, OSTEICH-129VT and PLAD-142S6KT, originating from small ponds and a creek. Phylogenetic reconstructions with 16S rRNA gene sequences and genome-based analyses with amino acid sequences of 501 core genes showed that all four strains belonged to the A. antheringensis branch of the genus Aquirufa. Calculation of whole-genome average nucleotide identity values and digital DNA-DNA hybridization values revealed that they represent in each case a new species. The genome sizes of the four strains were between 2.5 and 2.8 Mbp and the G + C values were between 41.4 and 41.8\%. Like all type strains of the genus Aquirufa, cells were rod-shaped, and liquid cultures and colonies on agar plates were red-pigmented, likely due to carotenoids. All strains except OSTEICH-129VT showed gliding motility on soft agar plates. All strains grew aerobically but only PLAD-142S6KT could grow weakly under anaerobic conditions. We propose here to establish the names Aquirufa esocilacus sp. nov. for strain HETE-83DT (= DSM 118087T = JCM 37094T), Aquirufa originis sp. nov. for KTFRIE-69FT (= DSM 117798T = JCM 37095T), Aquirufa avitistagni for OSTEICH-129VT (= DSM 118088T = JCM 37100T) and Aquirufa echingensis sp. nov. for PLAD-142S6KT (= DSM 117799T = JCM 37096T).},

Strain 1-SAACH-A3T was characterized by a genome size of 3.2 Mbp and a G + C value of 38.4 mol\% and encoded genes predicted for nitrate uptake and nitrous oxide utilization. Strains BAHN-186BT and 2-AUSEE-184A6 were characterized by a genome size of 2.4 Mbp and a G + C value of 42.4 and 42.2 mol\%, respectively, and encoded genes predicted for the light-harvesting rhodopsin system. Calculated whole-genome average nucleotide identity values with Aquirufa type strains resulted in a maximum value of 93.65\% for comparison of strain 1-SAACHT with the type strain of Aquirufa ecclesiirivi, which is slightly under the proposed threshold of species demarcation. The calculated gANI value comparing strains BAHN-186BT and 2-AUSEE-184A6 revealed 95.76\%, thus a value slightly above the threshold. Further analyses revealed that the three new strains represent two new species, proposed here as Aquirufa salirivi sp. nov. with type strain 1-SAACH-A3T (= DSM 117800 T = JCM 37097 T) and Aquirufa novilacunae sp. nov. with type strain BAHN-186BT (= DSM 118143 T = JCM 37099 T). Analyses of 123 publicly available metagenomes and a metagenome of the lake Ausee resulted in no detection of A. salirivi sp. nov. In contrast, A. novilacunae sp. nov. could be detected in 15 water samples of rivers, mainly from Asia, but also from North America and Australia. The analyses suggested that the species occurs in most of these samples in low relative abundance, detections derived from metagenomes of water samples from the river Yangtze in the subtropical zone could be interpreted as occurrence in higher abundances.},

 abstract = {Phage therapy has emerged as a promising alternative for combating infections caused by drug-resistant pathogens. Among these, Enterococcus faecalis remains a significant public health concern due to its persistence in clinical settings and frequent involvement in healthcare-associated infections (HAIs). In this study, we report the characterization of the lytic bacteriophage vB\_EfaS\_LOK1, isolated from urban sewage using E. faecalis strain IIH-74.4 as the host. Transmission electron microscopy revealed morphological features consistent with the phages formerly classified within the Siphoviridae family. The phage exhibited high thermal and pH stability, remaining viable up to 70 °C and within a pH range of 4-11. It displayed a latent period of 20 min and a burst size of 72 PFU/cell. Notably, vB\_EfaS\_LOK1 exhibited a narrow host range, lysing only the strain used for their isolation. Genomic analysis revealed a 41.2 kb double-stranded DNA genome devoid of known virulence or antibiotic resistance genes. Phylogenomic analysis classified the phage within the genus Efquatrovirus (Caudoviricetes), suggesting it represents a newly isolated bacteriophage species. Functional annotation identified genes related to DNA replication, host interaction, and bacterial lysis, including endolysins and holins with putative antimicrobial properties. Long-term stability assays demonstrated that tryptic soy broth (TSB) with CaCl2/MgCl2 at 4 °C maintained viability for at least 90 days. Collectively, these findings support the potential of vB\_EfaS\_LOK1 as a potential candidate for the development of phage-based therapies targeting E. faecalis.},

 abstract = {Limbal stem cell deficiency (LSCD) is a complex, multifactorial disease affecting limbal epithelial progenitor cells (LEPC), which are essential for maintaining corneal stability and transparency. Human induced pluripotent stem cell-derived (hiPSC-) LEPC are a promising cell source for the treatment of LSCD. However, their similarity to native tissue-derived (T-) LEPC and their functional characterization has not been studied in detail. Here, we show that hiPSC-LEPC and T-LEPC have rather similar gene expression patterns, colony-forming ability, wound-healing capacity, and melanosome uptake. In addition, hiPSC-LEPC exhibited lower immunogenicity and reduced the proliferation of peripheral blood mononuclear cells compared with T-LEPC. Similarly, the hiPSC-LEPC secretome reduced the proliferation of vascular endothelial cells more than the T-LEPC secretome. Moreover, hiPSC-LEPC successfully repopulated decellularized human corneolimbal (DHC/L) scaffolds with multilayered epithelium, while basal deposition of fibrillary material was observed. These findings suggest that hiPSC-LEPC exhibited functional properties close to native LEPC and that hiPSC-LEPC-DHC/L scaffolds might be feasible for transplantation in patients suffering from LSCD in the future. Although hiPSC-LEPC-based stem cell therapy is promising, the current study also revealed new challenges, such as abnormal extracellular matrix deposition, that need to be overcome before hiPSC-LEPC-based stem cell therapies are viable.},

@article{potgieter_metanovo_2023,
 abstract = {Background Microbiome research is providing important new insights into the metabolic interactions of complex microbial ecosystems involved in fields as diverse as the pathogenesis of human diseases, agriculture and climate change. Poor correlations typically observed between RNA and protein expression datasets make it hard to accurately infer microbial protein synthesis from metagenomic data. Additionally, mass spectrometry-based metaproteomic analyses typically rely on focused search sequence databases based on prior knowledge for protein identification that may not represent all the proteins present in a set of samples. Metagenomic 16S rRNA sequencing only targets the bacterial component, while whole genome sequencing is at best an indirect measure of expressed proteomes. Here we describe a novel approach, MetaNovo, that combines existing open-source software tools to perform scalable de novo sequence tag matching with a novel algorithm for probabilistic optimization of the entire UniProt knowledgebase to create tailored sequence databases for target-decoy searches directly at the proteome level, enabling metaproteomic analyses without prior expectation of sample composition or metagenomic data generation and compatible with standard downstream analysis pipelines. Results We compared MetaNovo to published results from the MetaPro-IQ pipeline on 8 human mucosal-luminal interface samples, with comparable numbers of peptide and protein identifications, many shared peptide sequences and a similar bacterial taxonomic distribution compared to that found using a matched metagenome sequence database—but simultaneously identified many more non-bacterial peptides than the previous approaches. MetaNovo was also benchmarked on samples of known microbial composition against matched metagenomic and whole genomic sequence database workflows, yielding many more MS/MS identifications for the expected taxa, with improved taxonomic representation, while also highlighting previously described genome sequencing quality concerns for one of the organisms, and identifying an experimental sample contaminant without prior expectation. Conclusions By estimating taxonomic and peptide level information directly on microbiome samples from tandem mass spectrometry data, MetaNovo enables the simultaneous identification of peptides from all domains of life in metaproteome samples, bypassing the need for curated sequence databases to search. We show that the MetaNovo approach to mass spectrometry metaproteomics is more accurate than current gold standard approaches of tailored or matched genomic sequence database searches, can identify sample contaminants without prior expectation and yields insights into previously unidentified metaproteomic signals, building on the potential for complex mass spectrometry metaproteomic data to speak for itself.},

We demonstrated the use of the proposed method in detection of biologically relevant DEGs in glioblastoma (GBM), the most aggressive brain cancer. Our approach notably enabled the identification of over-expressed tumour suppressor gene RAD51 in GBM compared to healthy controls, which has recently been shown to be a target for inhibition to enhance radiosensitivity of GBM cells during treatment.

 abstract = {Drought hinders growth, development, and productivity of higher plants. While the physiological and molecular background of plant responses to drought has been extensively studied, the role of post-translational modifications of histones or DNA methylation in response to dehydration remains largely elusive. In this study, we deciphered genome-wide changes in transcriptome and histone modifications in response to dehydration in rapeseed (Brassica napus L.). High-throughput transcript profiling (RNA-seq) and ChIP followed by sequencing (ChIP-seq) of polyethylene glycol (PEG)-treated rapeseed plants revealed genome-scale changes in transcription and histone methylation patterns, specifically in histone H3 lysine 4 trimethylation (H3K4me3) and histone H3 tri-methylated lysine 27 (H3K27me3) sites. We have identified gene sets with altered transcript profiles as well as histone methylation marks in response to osmotic stress. Several proline biosynthesis regulatory genes coding for Delta 1-Pyrroline-5-Carboxylate Synthetases (P5CS) displayed changes in H3K4me3 and/or H3K36me3 enrichment post-PEG treatment. Targeted bisulfite sequencing further identified stress-dependent gene body DNA methylation in one of the BnP5CSA gene copies that correlates with its stress-induced activation. By integrating physiological, transcriptional, and epigenomic data, our study contributes to a better understanding of the drought response control in crop plants.},

 abstract = {Pine Wilt Disease (PWD) is caused by \textit{Bursaphelenchus xylophilus}, the pinewood nematode, and affects several species of pine trees worldwide. The ecosystem of the \textit{Pinus pinaster} trees was investigated as a source of bacteria producing metabolites affecting this ecosystem: \textit{P. pinaster} trees as target-plant, nematode as disease effector and its insect-vector as shuttle. For example, metals and metal-carrying compounds contribute to the complex tree-ecosystems. This work aimed to detect novel secondary metabolites like metallophores and related molecules produced under iron limitation by PWD-associated bacteria and to test their activity on nematodes. After screening 357 bacterial strains from Portugal and United States, two promising metallophore-producing strains \textit{Erwinia} sp. A41C3 and \textit{Rouxiella} sp. Arv20\#4.1 were chosen and investigated in more detail. The genomes of these strains were sequenced, analyzed, and used to detect genetic potential for secondary metabolite production. A combinatorial approach of liquid chromatography-coupled tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS) linked to molecular networking was used to describe these compounds. Two major metabolites were detected by HPLC analyses and described. One HPLC fraction of strain Arv20\#4.1 showed to be a hydroxamate-type siderophore with higher affinity for chelation of Cu. The HPLC fraction of strain A41C3 with highest metal affinity showed to be a catecholate-type siderophore with higher affinity for chelation of Fe. LC-MS allowed the identification of several desferrioxamines from strain Arv20\#4.1, in special desferrioxamine E, but no hit was obtained in case of strain A41C3 which might indicate that it is something new. Bacteria and their culture supernatants showed ability to attract \textit{C. elegans}. HPLC fractions of those supernatant-extracts of \textit{Erwinia} strain A41C3, enriched with secondary metabolites such as siderophores, were able to kill pinewood nematode. These results suggest that metabolites secreted under iron limitation have potential to biocontrol \textit{B. xylophilus} and for management of Pine Wilt Disease.},

 abstract = {While prostaglandin E2 (PGE2) is produced in human tumor microenvironment (TME), its role therein remains poorly understood. Here, we examine this issue by comparative single-cell RNA sequencing of immune cells infiltrating human cancers and syngeneic tumors in female mice. PGE receptors EP4 and EP2 are expressed in lymphocytes and myeloid cells, and their expression is associated with the downregulation of oxidative phosphorylation (OXPHOS) and MYC targets, glycolysis and ribosomal proteins (RPs). Mechanistically, CD8+ T cells express EP4 and EP2 upon TCR activation, and PGE2 blocks IL-2-STAT5 signaling by downregulating Il2ra, which downregulates c-Myc and PGC-1 to decrease OXPHOS, glycolysis, and RPs, impairing migration, expansion, survival, and antitumor activity. Similarly, EP4 and EP2 are induced upon macrophage activation, and PGE2 downregulates c-Myc and OXPHOS in M1-like macrophages. These results suggest that PGE2-EP4/EP2 signaling impairs both adaptive and innate immunity in TME by hampering bioenergetics and ribosome biogenesis of tumor-infiltrating immune cells.},

Herein, this study utilized Illumina sequencing to characterize the whole genomes of nine clinical K. pneumoniae and one K. quasipneumoniae isolate obtained from patients of 3 major hospitals in Trinidad, West Indies. Reconstruction of the assembled genomes and implementation of several bioinformatic tools revealed unique features such as high pathogenicity islands associated with the isolates. The K. pneumoniae isolates were categorized as classical (n = 3), uropathogenic (n = 5), or hypervirulent (n = 1) strains. In silico multilocus sequence typing, and phylogenetic analysis showed that isolates were related to several international high-risk genotypes, including sequence types ST11, ST15, ST86, and ST307. Analysis of the virulome and mobilome of these pathogens showed unique and clinically important features including the presence of genes associated with Type 1 and Type 3 fimbriae, the aerobactin and yersiniabactin siderophore systems, the K2 and O1/2, and the O3 and O5 serotypes. These genes were either on or in close proximity to insertion sequence elements, phage sequences, and plasmids. Several secretion systems including the Type VI system and relevant effector proteins were prevalent in the local isolates. This is the first comprehensive study investigating the genomes of clinical K. pneumoniae and K. quasipneumoniae isolates from Trinidad, West Indies. The data presented illustrate the diversity of Trinidadian clinical K. pneumoniae isolates as well as significant virulence biomarkers and mobile elements associated with these isolates. Additionally, the genomes of the local isolates will add to global databases and thus can be used in future surveillance or genomic studies in this country and the wider Caribbean region.},

 abstract = {Objectives
Antibiotic-resistant Klebsiella pneumoniae is a human pathogen of major global concern due to its ability to cause multiple severe diseases that are often difficult to treat therapeutically. This study aimed to investigate the resistome of local clinical K. pneumoniae isolates.
Methods
Herein, we used a whole genome sequencing approach and bioinformatics tools to reconstruct the resistome of ten clinical K. pneumoniae isolates and one clinical isolate of the closely related Klebsiella quasipneumoniae obtained from patients from three major hospitals in Trinidad, West Indies.
Results
The results of the study revealed the presence of a complex antibiotic-resistant armory among the local isolates with multiple resistance mechanisms involving (i) inactivation of antibiotics, (ii) efflux pumps, (iii) antibiotic target alteration, protection, and replacement against antibiotics, and (iv) altered porin protein that reduced the permeability to antibiotics. Several resistance genes such as blaCTX-M-15, blaTEM-1B, blaSHV-28, blaKPC-2, oqxA, sul1, tetD, aac(6′)-Ib-cr5, aph(6)-Id, and fosA6, which are known to confer resistance to antibiotics used to treat K. pneumoniae infections. In most cases, the resistance genes were flanked by mobile elements, including insertion sequences and transposons, which facilitate the spread of these genetic features among related organisms.
Conclusion
This is the first comprehensive study to thoroughly investigate the resistome of clinical K. pneumoniae isolates and K. quasipneumoniae from Trinidad, West Indies. These findings suggest that monitoring K. pneumoniae and its genome-wide antibiotic resistance features in clinical strains would be of critical importance for guiding antibiotic stewardship programs and improving regional disease management systems for this pathogen.},

 abstract = {The viral intra-host genetic diversities and interactions with the human genome during decades of persistence remain poorly characterized. In this study, we analyzed the variability and integration sites of persisting viruses in nine organs from thirteen individuals who died suddenly from non-viral causes. The viruses studied included parvovirus B19, six herpesviruses, Merkel cell (MCPyV) and JC polyomaviruses, totaling 127 genomes. The viral sequences across organs were remarkably conserved within each individual, suggesting that persistence stems from single dominant strains. This indicates that intra-host viral evolution, thus far inferred primarily from immunocompromised patients, is likely overestimated in healthy subjects. Indeed, we detected increased viral subpopulations in two individuals with putative reactivations, suggesting that replication status influences diversity. Furthermore, we identified asymmetrical mutation patterns reflecting selective pressures exerted by the host. Strikingly, our analysis revealed non-clonal viral integrations even in individuals without cancer. These included MCPyV integrations and truncations resembling clonally expanded variants in Merkel cell carcinomas, as well as novel junctions between herpesvirus 6B and mitochondrial sequences, the significance of which remains to be evaluated. Our work systematically characterizes the genomic landscape of the tissue-resident virome, highlighting potential deviations occurring during disease.},

Tanshinone I and tanshinone IIB with anti-inflammatory, anti-bacterial, anti-oxidative, anti-neoplastic, neuron protective, and heart protective properties are valuable active components in it. However, the biosynthetic pathway of tanshinone IIB and tanshinone I has not been completely elucidated. Here, we identified a tanshinone IIA 19-hydroxylase from S. miltiorrhiza. In vitro and in vivo analyses showed that SmCYP71D373 could hydroxylate tanshinone IIA at C-19 position to produce tanshinone IIB. Reaction conditions optimization demonstrated that the catalytic efficiency of SmCYP71D373 was the highest using the substrate-feeding method under the following conditions, fed the tanshinone IIA into the Saccharomyces cerevisiae expressing codon-optimized SmCYP71D373 at 28℃ for 24 hours. And the yield of tanshinone IIB was up to 6.38\%. Furthermore, N121 and S210 of SmCYP71D373 were verified as the key amino acid residues responsible for its catalytic activity for tanshinone IIA by molecular docking and site-directed mutagenesis. The results not only lay a foundation for the elucidation of tanshinone I synthesis pathway, but also provide the theoretical support to improve the catalytic efficiency of SmCYP71D373 for tanshinone IIB production.},

 abstract = {Background/Objectives: Streptococcus uberis is a Gram-positive bacterium and a major cause of bovine mastitis. The use of antimicrobial treatments raises concerns about resistance. This study aimed to characterize S. uberis isolates from one of the ten largest milk-producing regions in Europe. Methods: Thirty-six isolates from 36 cows with mastitis were identified using MALDI-TOF and VITEK®MS. Susceptibility to 9 antibiotics (penicillin G, ampicillin, tetracycline, erythromycin, clindamycin, cefotaxime, ceftriaxone, levofloxacin, and moxifloxacin) was determined with VITEK®2. Whole-genome sequencing was performed using MinION Mk1C. Results: Alleles were identified for 7 loci: arcC, ddl, gki, recP, tdk, tpi, and yqiL. Only 10 isolates had alleles for all the loci. The loci with the highest number of alleles were ddl and tdk (33/36 strains), while arcC had the fewest (19/36). Four isolates were assigned to known sequence types (ST6, ST307, and ST184), and novel alleles were detected in 32 of the 36 isolates. Twelve isolates showed phenotypic resistance to one or more of the following antibiotics: tetracycline, erythromycin, clindamycin, and ceftriaxone. The lnu was the most frequently detected resistance gene (27 out of 102 total gene appearances). A total of 19 virulence factors were identified. All strains were predicted to be capable of infecting human hosts. Conclusions: Streptococcus uberis is a potential reservoir of antimicrobial resistance genes. The use of antimicrobials to treat bovine mastitis has reduced the susceptibility of this microorganism to several antibiotics, underscoring the importance of monitoring antimicrobial use in veterinary practice. The results also highlight the high genetic diversity of the isolates, suggesting a strong capacity to adapt to different environmental conditions.},

 abstract = {The discovery of antibiotics has radically changed the treatment of bacterial infections, making the increasing antibiotic resistance one of the top ten greatest threats to the global health. The main focus of antibiotic resistance research has, until recently, been focused on clinical settings and human and veterinary aspects. It has become more evident that the environment plays a vital role in the evolution, dissemination and prevalence of antibiotic resistant bacteria and genes. Aquatic ecosystems are a known mixing ground for clinical and environmental bacteria and can be a source and reservoir for resistance genes. The transfer of resistance between environmental and clinically important bacteria occurs, and surveillance of the environment is therefore important to better understand this flow of resistance.

The purpose of this thesis was to investigate the occurrence of antibiotic resistant bacteria and genes in aquatic environments in Ås and Nordre Follo municipalities in Norway. Water samples were collected from three different locations was filtered and plated out on Brilliance™ ESBL and CRE chromogenic agar plates selecting for Extended spectrum β-lactamase (ESBL) producing and carbapenem resistant bacteria. Bacterial colonies were isolated, and DNA was extracted, followed by 16S PCR and identification by Sanger sequencing. Multiplex and Singelplex PCR with ESBL-specific primers were utilized to screen for specific ESBL-genes, which were confirmed by sequencing. Selected bacterial strains were chosen for antimicrobial susceptibility testing using five different classes of antibiotics. Illumina MiSeq was utilized for whole genome sequencing (WGS) for three selected bacteria, followed by screening for antibiotic resistance and virulence genes, multidrug efflux pumps and metal resistance genes. Several bacteria genera were detected by selective agar plates and identified by 16S rRNA, including the genera Pseudomonas, Serratia, Herbaspirillum, Aeromonas, Shewanella, Chitinophaga and Pandoraea. The susceptibility testing revealed a high amount of resistance to Penicillins and four different Multidrug resistant (MDR) isolates. The bacteria showing the highest amount of resistance was Pandoraea sp., which demonstrated clinical resistance to five out of seven antibiotics tested. The screening for resistance in the three WGS bacteria, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Chitinophaga silvatica and Pandoraea sp., revealed several β-lactamases. This included the class D β-lactamases blaOXA-50, blaOXA-158 and two bla genes, and the class C β-lactamases blaPDC-202 and blaPAO. Several genes conferring metal resistance and genes for multidrug efflux pumps were also discovered. Together, the results obtained in this work indicate an occurrence of antibiotic resistant bacteria and resistance genes, including several blaOXA-variants, in the aquatic environments in Ås and Nordre-Follo municipalities.},

Detection and quantitation of peptides using targeted mass spectrometry-based strategies has been proposed as an alternative diagnostic tool due to direct detection of molecular indicators from non-invasively collected samples as well as the potential for high-throughput analysis in a clinical setting; many studies have revealed the presence of viral peptides within easily accessed patient samples. However, evidence suggests that some viral peptides could serve as better indicators of COVID-19 infection status than others, due to potential misidentification of peptides derived from human host proteins, poor spectral quality, high limits of detection etc. In this study we have compiled a list of 639 peptides identified from Sudden Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) samples, including from in vitro and clinical sources. These datasets were rigorously analyzed using automated, Galaxy-based workflows containing tools such as PepQuery, BLAST-P, and the Multi-omic Visualization Platform as well as the open-source tools MetaTryp and Proteomics Data Viewer (PDV). Using PepQuery for confirming peptide spectrum matches, we were able to narrow down the 639 peptide possibilities to 87 peptides which were most robustly detected and specific to the SARS-CoV-2 virus. The specificity of these sequences to coronavirus taxa was confirmed using Unipept and BLAST-P. Applying stringent statistical scoring thresholds, combined with manual verification of peptide spectrum match quality, 4 peptides derived from the nucleocapsid phosphoprotein and membrane protein were found to be most robustly detected across all cell culture and clinical samples, including those collected non-invasively. We propose that these peptides would be of the most value for clinical proteomics applications seeking to detect COVID-19 from a variety of sample types. We also contend that samples taken from the upper respiratory tract and oral cavity have the highest potential for diagnosis of SARS-CoV-2 infection from easily collected patient samples using mass spectrometry-based proteomics assays.},

@article{ramos_mobilome_2024,
 abstract = {Staphylococcus aureus thrives at animal-human-environment interfaces. A large-scale work from our group indicated that antimicrobial resistance (AMR) in commensal S. aureus strains from wild ungulates is associated with agricultural land cover and livestock farming, raising the hypothesis that AMR genes in wildlife strains may originate from different hosts, namely via exchange of mobile genetic elements (MGE). In this work, we generate the largest available dataset of S. aureus draft genomes from wild ungulates in Portugal and explore their mobilome, which can determine important traits such as AMR, virulence, and host specificity, to understand MGE exchange. Core genome multi-locus sequence typing based on 98 newly generated draft genomes and 101 publicly available genomes from Portugal demonstrated that the genomic relatedness of S. aureus from wild ungulates assigned to livestock-associated sequence types (ST) is greater compared to wild ungulate isolates assigned to human-associated STs. Screening of host specificity determinants disclosed the unexpected presence in wildlife of the immune evasion cluster encoded in φSa3 prophage, described as a human-specific virulence determinant. Additionally, two plasmids, pAVX and pETB, previously associated with avian species and humans, respectively, and the Tn553 transposon were detected. Both pETB and Tn553 encode penicillin resistance through blaZ. Pangenome analysis of wild ungulate isolates shows a core genome fraction of 2133 genes, with isolates assigned to ST72 and ST3224 being distinguished from the remaining by MGEs, although there is no reported role of these in adaptation to wildlife. AMR related gene clusters found in the shell genome are directly linked to resistance against penicillin, macrolides, fosfomycin, and aminoglycosides, and they represent mobile ARGs. Altogether, our findings support epidemiological interactions of human and non-human hosts at interfaces, with MGE exchange, including AMR determinants, associated with putative indirect movements of S. aureus among human and wildlife hosts that might be bridged by livestock.},

Each mitogenome contained the typical 37 genes (13 PCGs, 22 tRNAs, and 2 rRNAs), with most tRNAs forming clover structures (except trnK, trnH, trnN, trnS1, trnS2, and trnR). Comparative analysis with nine existing Camaenidae mitogenomes revealed: (1) The nucleotide composition of mitochondrial genes was significantly skewed toward A and T; (2) Most protein genes used ATN start codons and TAA/T- stop codons; (3) Synonymous codons ending with T/A were dominant. Analyses (PR2-plot, neutrality plot) indicated codon usage was influenced by both mutation pressure and natural selection. Phylogenetically, the three newly sequenced species clustered within Bradybaeninae of Camaenidae, consistent with previous classifications. The results support Hygromiidae and Geomitridae as sister groups and identify Polygyridae as the sister clade to Camaenidae. Additionally, they also partially support elevating Satsuma and its subgenus to subfamily status. This study enriches mitogenomic resources for Camaenidae and provides foundational data for future research on codon usage, adaptive evolution, and phylogenetics within this family.},

 abstract = {Custos is open source software that provides user, group, and resource credential management services for science gateways. This paper describes the resource credential, or secrets, management service in Custos that allows science gateways to safely manage security tokens, SSH keys, and passwords on behalf of users. Science gateways such as Galaxy are well-established mechanisms for researchers to access cyberinfrastructure and, increasingly, couple it with other online services, such as user-provided storage or compute resources. To support this use case, science gateways need to operate on behalf of the users to connect, acquire, and release these resources, which are protected by a variety of authentication and access mechanisms. Storing and managing the credentials associated with these access mechanisms must be done using “best of breed” software and established security protocols. The Custos Secrets Service allows science gateways to store and retrieve these credentials using secure protocols and APIs while the data is protected at rest. Here, we provide implementation details for the service, describe the available APIs and SDKs, and discuss integration with Galaxy as a use case.},

@article{ranchou-peyruse_microbial_2021,
 abstract = {Deep aquifers (up to 2km deep) contain massive volumes of water harboring large and diverse microbial communities at high pressure. Aquifers are home to microbial ecosystems that participate in physicochemical balances. These microorganisms can positively or negatively interfere with subsurface (i) energy storage (CH$_{\textrm{4}}$ and H$_{\textrm{2}}$), (ii) CO$_{\textrm{2}}$ sequestration; and (iii) resource (water, rare metals) exploitation. The aquifer studied here (720m deep, 37°C, 88bar) is naturally oligotrophic, with a total organic carbon content of {\textless}1mg.L$^{\textrm{-1}}$ and a phosphate content of 0.02mg.L$^{\textrm{-1}}$. The influence of natural gas storage locally generates different pressures and formation water displacements, but it also releases organic molecules such as monoaromatic hydrocarbons at the gas/water interface. The hydrocarbon biodegradation ability of the indigenous microbial community was evaluated in this work. The \textit{in situ} microbial community was dominated by sulfate-reducing (e.g., Sva0485 lineage, Thermodesulfovibriona, \textit{Desulfotomaculum}, \textit{Desulfomonile}, and \textit{Desulfovibrio}), fermentative (e.g., \textit{Peptococcaceae} SCADC1\_2\_3, Anaerolineae lineage and \textit{Pelotomaculum}), and homoacetogenic bacteria ("\textit{Candidatus} Acetothermia") with a few archaeal representatives (e.g., \textit{Methanomassiliicoccaceae}, \textit{Methanobacteriaceae}, and members of the Bathyarcheia class), suggesting a role of H$_{\textrm{2}}$ in microenvironment functioning. Monoaromatic hydrocarbon biodegradation is carried out by sulfate reducers and favored by concentrated biomass and slightly acidic conditions, which suggests that biodegradation should preferably occur in biofilms present on the surfaces of aquifer rock, rather than by planktonic bacteria. A simplified bacterial community, which was able to degrade monoaromatic hydrocarbons at atmospheric pressure over several months, was selected for incubation experiments at \textit{in situ} pressure (i.e., 90bar). These showed that the abundance of various bacterial genera was altered, while taxonomic diversity was mostly unchanged. The candidate phylum Acetothermia was characteristic of the community incubated at 90bar. This work suggests that even if pressures on the order of 90bar do not seem to select for obligate piezophilic organisms, modifications of the thermodynamic equilibria could favor different microbial assemblages from those observed at atmospheric pressure.},

Mutations in the homeodomain transcription factor SIX1 and its co-factor EYA1 have been identified in about 50\% of individuals with BOS or BOR, while causative mutations are unknown in the other half. We hypothesise that SIX1 target genes represent new BOS and BOR candidates. Using published transcriptomic and epigenomic data from chick ear progenitors, we first identify putative Six1 targets. Next, we provide evidence that Six1 directly regulates some of these candidates: Six1 binds to their enhancers, and functional experiments in Xenopus and chick confirm that Six1 controls their expression. Finally, we show that most putative chick Six1 targets are also expressed in the human developing ear and are associated with known deafness loci. Together, our results not only characterise the molecular mechanisms that mediate Six1 function in the developing ear, but also provide new candidates for human congenital deafness.},

 abstract = {Continuous vision loss due to vasoproliferative eye disease still represents an unsolved issue despite anti-vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) therapy. The impact of signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 (STAT3) signaling on retinal angiogenesis and its potential use as a therapeutic target remain controversial. In vitro, oncostatin M (OSM), as a strong STAT3 activator, possesses robust proangiogenic activity. This study investigated to what extent the proangiogenic effects of OSM translate to the in vivo setting of vasoproliferative eye disease.    The in vitro effect of OSM on endothelial cells was investigated in the spheroid sprouting assay and through RNA sequencing. The mouse model for oxygen-induced retinopathy (OIR) was used to evaluate the impact of OSM in vivo. Signaling patterns were measured by western blot and retinal cryosections. Primary Müller cell cultures were used to evaluate the effect of OSM on the Müller cell secretome. Murine retinal vascular endothelial cells were isolated from OIR retinas using fluorescence-activated cell sorting (FACS) and were used for RNA sequencing.    Although OSM induced pro-angiogenic responses in vitro, in the OIR model intravitreal injection of OSM reduced retinal neovascularization by 65.2\% and vaso-obliteration by 45.5\% in Müller cells. Injecting OSM into the vitreous activated the STAT3 signaling pathway in multiple retinal cell types, including Müller cells. In vitro, OSM treatment increased CXCL10 secretion. RNA sequencing of sorted vascular endothelial cells at OIR P17 following OSM treatment indicated downregulation of angiogenesis- and mitosis-associated genes.    In vivo, OSM reveals a beneficial angiomodulatory effect by activating Müller cells and changing their secretome. The data highlight contradictions between cytokine-induced effects in vitro and in vivo depending on the cell types mediating the effect.},

@article{rapp_stat3_2023,
 abstract = {Aberrant angiogenesis is a hallmark of cardiovascular and retinal neovascular disease. The STAT3 signaling pathway represents a potential pharmacological target for these diseases due to its impact on angiogenesis. Surprisingly, some STAT3 activators, such as the IL-6 cytokine family member oncostatin M (OSM), enhance angiogenesis, whereas others, such as ciliary neurotropic factor (CNTF), reduce it. This study aimed to clarify these conflicting effects. In contrast to the anti-angiogenic cytokine CNTF, the pro-angiogenic cytokine OSM was able to activate intracellular signaling pathways beyond the STAT3 pathway, including the ERK and AKT pathways. These differences translated into transcriptomic and metabolic shifts. siRNA-mediated STAT3 knockdown experiments showed a decrease in VEGF-induced endothelial migration and sprouting, enhancing the pro-angiogenic drive of OSM and switching the CNTF response from anti-angiogenic to pro-angiogenic. These effects correlated with a transcriptomic shift representing enhanced STAT1 and ERK activity following STAT3 knockdown, including a compensatory prolonged phosphorylated STAT1 activity. In conclusion, the angiogenic effect of STAT3 appears to be determined by cytokine-induced STAT3 specificity and simultaneous activity of other intracellular signaling pathways, whereas the STAT3 pathway, predominantly recognized for its pro-angiogenic phenotypes, reveals novel anti-angiogenic potential.},

@article{rasche_training_2020,
 abstract = {{\textless}p{\textgreater}Background: Hands-on training, whether it is in Bioinformatics or other scientific domains, requires significant resources and knowledge to setup and run. Trainers must have access to infrastructure that can support the sudden spike in usage, with classes of 30 or more trainees simultaneously running resource-intensive tools. For efficient classes, the jobs must run quickly, without queuing delays, lest they disrupt the timetable set out for the class. Often times this is achieved via running on a private server where there is no contention for the queue, and therefore no or minimal waiting time. However, this requires the teacher or trainer to have the technical knowledge to manage compute infrastructure, in addition to their didactic responsibilities. This presents significant burdens to potential training events, in terms of infrastructure cost, person-hours of preparation, technical knowledge, and available staff to manage such events. Findings: Galaxy Europe has developed Training Infrastructure as a Service (TIaaS) which we provide to the scientific commnuity as a service built on top of the Galaxy Platform. Training event organisers request a training and Galaxy administrators can allocate private queues specifically for the training. Trainees are transparently placed in a private queue where their jobs run without delay. Trainers access the dashboard of the TIaaS Service and can remotely follow the progress of their trainees without in-person interactions. Conclusions: TIaaS on Galaxy Europe provides reusable and fast infrastructure for Galaxy training. The instructor dashboard provides visibility into class progress, making in-person trainings more efficient and remote training possible. In the past 24 months, \$\&gt;110\$ trainings with over 3000 trainees have used this infrastructure for training, across scientific domains, all enjoying the accessibility and reproducibility of Galaxy for training the next generation of bioinformaticians. TIaaS itself is an extension to Galaxy which can be deployed by any Galaxy administrator to provide similar benefits for their users. https://galaxyproject.eu/tiaas{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

Advancements in the field of metagenomic analysis of the human gut microbiota, shedding light on its potential implications for human health. the study of the human gut microbiota through metagenomics has unveiled an astounding diversity of microbial species, encompassing bacteria, archaea, viruses, and eukaryotic microorganisms. The gut microbiota's composition varies significantly between individuals, influenced by factors such as diet, age, genetics, geographical location, and overall health status. Advances in sequencing technologies and bioinformatics tools have facilitated comprehensive profiling of the gut microbiome, enabling researchers to explore the intricate relationships between specific microbial taxa and their functions. The gut microbiota's influence extends beyond the gastrointestinal tract, impacting various physiological processes, including metabolism, neurodevelopment, and even mental health. Dysbiosis, an imbalance in the gut microbiota composition, has been associated with various health conditions such as inflammatory bowel diseases, obesity, diabetes, and allergies. In conclusion, metagenomic analysis of the human gut microbiota has revolutionized our understanding of the microbial world residing within us. This research has paved the way for personalized approaches to healthcare, such as targeted dietary interventions, fecal microbiota transplantation, and the development of novel therapeutics aimed at modulating the gut microbiota to promote health and combat disease. Continued research in this field promises to unlock new frontiers in microbiology, advancing our knowledge of the intricate relationship between humans and their gut microbial companions.},

We aimed to use shotgun metagenomic sequencing to investigate the associations between potentially unidentified pathogens and SCE. Uterine cytobrush samples from multiparous Holstein cows (n = 23) were taken at 21 days in milk (DIM) and sequenced via the Illumina shotgun platform. At 36 DIM, the cows were diagnosed as CE (n = 7), SCE (n = 7), or healthy (n = 9). We did not find differences in the alpha and beta diversity of bacteria and eukaryotes among the health groups. Relative abundance of typical pathogens i.e. Fusobacterium, Peptoniphilus, Peptostreptococcus, and Trueperella was greater in CE than healthy controls. We did not find evidence of eukaryotic or viral association in infection, yet, distinct patterns of bacterial co-occurrence were observed among pathogenic and non-pathogenic bacteria. In CE cows, Wnt/catenin pathway had lower abundance than SCE or healthy cows. Our findings support that CE is characterized by domination of pathogenic bacteria that intercorrelate, whereas SCE is not associated with bacterial colonization.},

Given their vital function of unwinding double-stranded nucleic acids, inhibiting them blocks the viral replication cycle. Previous studies have elucidated key structural details of these helicases, including the location of substrate binding sites, flexible domains, and the discovery of potential inhibitors. Here we present a series of new Galaxy tools and workflows for performing and analyzing molecular dynamics simulations of viral helicases. We first validate them by demonstrating recapitulation of data from previous simulations of Zika (NS3) and SARS-CoV-2 (NSP13) helicases in apo and complex with inhibitors. We further demonstrate the utility and generalizability of these Galaxy workflows by applying them to new cases, proving their usefulness as a widely accessible method for exploring antiviral activity.},

 abstract = {Abstract Tissues in multicellular organisms are populated by resident macrophages, which perform both generic and tissue-specific functions. The latter are induced by signals from the microenvironment and rely on unique tissue-specific molecular programs requiring the combinatorial action of tissue-specific and broadly expressed transcriptional regulators. Here, we identify the transcription factors Bhlhe40 and Bhlhe41 as novel regulators of alveolar macrophages (AMs)?a population that provides the first line of immune defense and executes homeostatic functions in lung alveoli. In the absence of these factors, AMs exhibited decreased proliferation that resulted in a severe disadvantage of knockout AMs in a competitive setting. Gene expression analyses revealed a broad cell-intrinsic footprint of Bhlhe40/Bhlhe41 deficiency manifested by a downregulation of AM signature genes and induction of signature genes of other macrophage lineages. Genome-wide characterization of Bhlhe40 DNA binding suggested that these transcription factors directly repress the expression of lineage-inappropriate genes in AMs. Taken together, these results identify Bhlhe40 and Bhlhe41 as key regulators of AM self-renewal and guardians of their identity.},

Despite its known effects on cholesterol metabolism, the role of PCSK9 in cardiac function, especially post-myocardial infarction (MI), remains unclear. This study investigates the impact of PCSK9 on heart function post-MI and evaluates the effects of PCSK9 inhibition via Alirocumab.{\textless}h4{\textgreater}Methods{\textless}/h4{\textgreater}We used PCSK9 knockout (KO) mice and wildtype (WT) mice and \textit{in vivo} treatment with Alirocumab to analyze cardiac function and survival post-MI induced by permanent ligation of the left anterior descending artery.

Alirocumab treatment, while effective in lowering plasma cholesterol, did not replicate the survival benefits seen in PCSK9 KO mice and even worsened cardiac function post-MI. \textit{In vitro}, PCSK9 induced significant inflammatory responses in macrophages, which were not mitigated by Alirocumab.{\textless}h4{\textgreater}Conclusion{\textless}/h4{\textgreater}PCSK9 accumulation in the heart post-MI contributes to adverse cardiac remodeling and inflammation. Genetic deletion of PCSK9 confers protection against post-infarct mortality, whereas pharmacological inhibition with Alirocumab fails to reproduce these benefits and may exacerbate cardiac dysfunction.

Despite efforts in reducing the risk factors, and enhancing pharmacotherapeutic strategies, challenges persist in early identification of disease progression and functional recovery of damaged hearts. Targeting mitochondrial dysfunction, a key player in the pathogenesis of CVD has been less successful due to its role in other coexisting diseases. Additionally, it is the only organelle with an agathokakological function that is a remedy and a poison for the cell. In this review, we describe the origins of cardiac mitochondria and the role of heteroplasmy and mitochondrial subpopulations namely the interfibrillar, subsarcolemmal, perinuclear, and intranuclear mitochondria in maintaining cardiac function and in disease-associated remodeling. The cumulative evidence of mitochondrial retrograde communication with the nucleus is addressed, highlighting the need to study the genotype-phenotype relationships of specific organelle functions with CVD by using approaches like genome-wide association study (GWAS). Finally, we discuss the practicality of computational methods combined with single-cell sequencing technologies to address the challenges of genetic screening in the identification of heteroplasmy and contributory genes towards CVD.},

 abstract = {Sex inequalities in cancer are well documented, but the current limited understanding is hindering advances in precision medicine and therapies1. Consideration of ethnicity, age and sex is essential for the management of cancer patients because they underlie important differences in both incidence and response to treatment2,3. Age-related hormone production, which is a consistent divergence between the sexes, is underestimated in cancers that are not recognized as being hormone dependent4–6. Here, we show that premenopausal women have increased vulnerability to cancers, and we identify the cell–cell adhesion molecule E-cadherin as a crucial component in the oestrogen response in various cancers, including melanoma. In a mouse model of melanoma, we discovered an oestrogen-sensitizing pathway connecting E-cadherin, β-catenin, oestrogen receptor-α and GRPR that promotes melanoma aggressiveness in women. Inhibiting this pathway by targeting GRPR or oestrogen receptor-α reduces metastasis in mice, indicating its therapeutic potential. Our study introduces a concept linking hormone sensitivity and tumour phenotype in which hormones affect cell phenotype and aggressiveness. We have identified an integrated pro-tumour pathway in women and propose that targeting a G-protein-coupled receptor with drugs not commonly used for cancer treatment could be more effective in treating E-cadherin-dependent cancers in women. This study emphasizes the importance of sex-specific factors in cancer management and offers hope of improving outcomes in various cancers.},

 abstract = {Humane Papillomviren (HPV) infizieren Keratinozyten der Haut- und Schleimhaut. Die Hochrisiko-Typen (HR) der alpha-Gattung verursachen dadurch anogenitalen- und oropharyngalen-Krebs. Vorherrschend dabei ist das Zervixkarzinom, welches zu 70 \% von HPV16 und HPV18 ausgelöst wird. Im Gegensatz dazu sind die onkogenen Eigenschaften der beta-HPV Gattung weniger gut erforscht. Bei Patienten mit der seltenen Erbkrankheit Epidermodysplasia Verruciformis (EV) und Organtransplantatempfängern (OTRs) wird ein Zusammenhang zwischen beta-HPV-Infektionen und der Entstehung von kutanen Plattenepithelkarzinomen vermutet. Bisher wurden die Eigenschaften von beta-HPV vor allem durch retrovirale Expression der E6 und E7 Onkogene in Keratinozyten, durch Transfektion der Osteosarkomzelllinie U2OS mit beta-HPV Genomen und in transgenen Mausmodellen untersucht, aber nicht mit vollständigen viralen Genomen in normalen humanen Keratinozyten (NHK), den natürlichen Zielzellen. Im Rahmen meiner Dissertation konnte ich zeigen, dass HPV8-, 38- und 49-Genome in humanen Keratinozyten mindestens neun Tage lang transkriptionell aktiv sind und replizieren. Durch Inaktivierung des viralen E8{\textasciicircum}E2 Repressors (E8-/E8{\textasciicircum}E2-) erhält das HPV49 Genom die Fähigkeit NHK zu immortalisieren. Die immortalisierten HPV49 E8- Zelllinien enthalten große Mengen an episomalen Virusgenomen und viralen Transkripten und behalten diese in Kultur über einen langen Zeitraum. Nicht nur der Verlust der E6 und E7 Onkogene, sondern auch eine Inaktivierung der E1 oder E2 Replikationsgene verhindern die Immortalisierung. Die E8-/E1- und E8-/E2- Genome zeigen deutlich niedrigere E6 und E7 Transkriptmengen in transienten Experimenten. Dies legt nahe, dass für die Immortalisierung eine starke E6 und E7 Expression von extrachromosomalen Virusgenomen erforderlich ist. Die Notwendigkeit für eine Inaktivierung von E8 im Kontext von intakten E1 und E2 Genen für die Immortalisierung von NHK zeigt, dass E8{\textasciicircum}E2 eine wichtige Rolle bei der Kontrolle der Onkogenität von beta-HPV spielen könnte, und weist auf grundlegende Unterschiede zwischen HPV49 und HR-HPV Genomen hin. 
Durch RNA-Sequenzierung der HPV49 E8- positiven Zelllinien konnten bekannte Spleißverknüpfungen bestätigt, das frühe Polyadenylierungssignal lokalisiert und Hinweise auf unterschiedliche virale Promotoren erhalten werden. Außerdem wurden neue Spleißverbindungen kartiert und ein neuer Spleißdonor im E6 Gen funktionell untersucht. Dieser beeinflusst die Menge an E6 Protein und vermutlich dadurch die Immortalisierung durch das HPV49 E8- Genom. 
Bei HPV8 und 38 konnten auch durch Inaktivierung von E8{\textasciicircum}E2 keine immortalisierten Zelllinien erzeugt werden, obwohl ähnliche Mengen an Transkripten für die E6 und E7 Onkogene wie bei HPV49 E8- Genomen transkribiert wurden. Dies legt nahe, dass beta-HPV Genome unterschiedliche onkogene Eigenschaften besitzen. Die Inaktivierung der Replikationsgene E1 und E2 reduzierte die Transkription aller untersuchten beta-HPV in NHK, was nahelegt, dass auch WT Genome aktiv replizieren. Die Kultivierung von HPV8- oder 38-transfizierten NHKs in organotypischen Modellen, die die Analyse des produktiven Replikationszyklus von HR-HPV ermöglichen, induziert Transkripte für das L1 Kapsidgen, was nahelegt, dass der produktive Lebenszyklus eingeleitet wurde. Außerdem ähnelt das HPV8-Transkriptionsmuster in organotypischen Kulturen dem einer HPV8-positiven EV-Läsion. 
Zusammengefasst bedeutet dies, dass NHK ein physiologisch relevantes System sind, um die Replikation und onkogenen Eigenschaften von beta-HPV zu untersuchen.},

 abstract = {Vitamin D nimmt nicht nur eine wichtige Funktion im Knochenstoffwechsel ein, es spielt darüber hinaus eine bedeutende Rolle bei der angeborenen und adaptiven Immunabwehr 3 und auch bei malignen Neoplasien ist der Vitamin D Serumspiegel der Patienten von prognostischer Relevanz 7, 37. Bei B Zell Lymphomen konnte gezeigt werden, dass ein höherer Vitamin D Spiegel mit einem besseren Überleben assoziiert ist, vor allem wenn die Patienten mit dem monoklonalen Antikörper Rituximab behandelt wurden 6. Die Wirkung monoklonaler Antikörper, die heute in der Tumortherapie routinemäßig eingesetzt werden, ist von der antikörperabhängigen zellvermittelten Zytotoxizität der natürlichen Killerzellen abhängig 60, 75. Basierend auf den Ergebnissen der Ricover 60 Studie konnten Bittenbring et al. bei sieben Probanden nach Supplementation von Vitamin D und Normalisierung des 25 Hydroxyvitamin D-Spiegels eine signifikant höhere antikörperabhängige zellvermittelte Zytotoxizität nachweisen 6. 
Für die vorliegende Arbeit wurden zehn Probanden (fünf Frauen und fünf Männer) mit einem Vitamin D-Mangel beziehungsweise einer Vitamin D-Insuffizienz rekrutiert. Nach erfolgter Vitamin D-Supplementation lag der Vitamin D-Serumspiegel aller zehn Probanden im suffizienten Bereich (71,48 ng/ml ± 9,47 ng/ml). Die Aktivität der antikörperabhängigen zellvermittelten Zytotoxizität stieg bei allen Probanden nach Supplementation an, ein signifikanter Anstieg konnte bei acht von zehn Probanden nachgewiesen werden. 
Es muss folglich angenommen werden, dass die Supplementation von Vitamin D Einfluss auf die Transkription von Genen der natürlichen Killerzellen nimmt, die für die Abwehrfunktion ausschlaggebend sind. Deshalb wurde in dieser Studie die Genexpression an Target-Zellen aktivierter und nicht aktivierter (passiver) natürlicher Killerzellen vor und nach in vivo Vitamin D Supplementation mittels RNA Sequenzierung untersucht.  
Diese Arbeit konnte sowohl bei passiven als auch bei aktivierten natürlichen Killerzellen nach im Vergleich zu vor in vivo Vitamin D Supplementation Veränderungen im Transkriptom nachweisen, insbesondere aber bei aktivierten natürlichen Killerzellen. Auch bei den zusätzlich durchgeführten Vergleichen aktivierter versus passiver natürlicher Killerzellen jeweils vor und nach Vitamin D Supplementation zeigten sich zahlreiche Gene differentiell exprimiert. Wobei bei diesen beiden Vergleichen viele der hoch- und runterregulierten Gene unabhängig vom Vitamin D Status übereinstimmen und somit auf die Aktivierung der natürlichen Killerzellen zurückzuführen sind. 2.440 Gene wiesen jedoch eine signifikante Änderung der Expression nach Aktivierung der natürlichen Killerzellen nur nach Vitamin D Supplementation auf, diese Gene könnten von besonderem Interesse sein.  
Da nicht einzelne differenziell exprimierte Gene die Funktion einer Zelle ausmachen, sondern das Zusammenspiel vieler Transkripte, die sich innerhalb einer Zelle unter verschiedenen Bedingungen zu biologischen Pfaden (engl. Pathways) organisieren, erfolgte zudem eine Genmengen Anreicherungsanalyse. Damit konnte nachgewiesen werden, dass zentrale Pfade der Immunabwehr und der Signaltransduktion bei den verschiedenen Vergleichen angereichert werden. Hervorzuheben ist, dass sowohl bei passiven als auch bei aktivierten natürlichen Killerzellen nach Vitamin D Supplementation der “Cytokine-cytokine receptor interaction“ Pathway signifikant stärker exprimiert wird. Dieser Pathway ist entscheidend für die intrazelluläre Regulation von Zellen, die an der angeborenen und der adaptiven Immunabwehr beteiligt sind 17. Bereits bei peripheren mononukleären Zellen konnte eine Anreicherung des “Cytokine-cytokine receptor interaction“ Pathways nach ex vivo Vitamin D Supplementation nachgewiesen werden 24. 
Darüber hinaus konnte in der vorliegenden Arbeit gezeigt werden, dass der Pathway “natural killer cell mediated cytotoxicity“ bei passiven und aktivierten natürlichen Killerzellen nach Vitamin D Supplementation angereichert wird. Dieser biologische Pfad beinhaltet sowohl die Kaskaden der aktivierenden und inhibierenden Rezeptoren von natürlichen Killerzellen im Allgemeinen, als auch die der antikörperabhängigen zellvermittelten Zytotoxizität im Speziellen 47.},

@article{reimann_specificities_2020,
 abstract = {Many bacteria and archaea possess an RNA-guided adaptive and inheritable immune system that consists of clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats (CRISPRs) and CRISPR-associated (Cas) proteins. In most CRISPR-Cas systems, the maturation of CRISPR-derived small RNAs (crRNAs) is essential for functionality. Cas6 endonucleases function as the most frequent CRISPR RNA maturation enzymes. In the cyanobacterium \textit{Anabaena} sp. PCC 7120, ten CRISPR loci are present, but only two \textit{cas} gene cassettes plus a Tn7-associated eleventh array. In this study, we deleted the two \textit{cas6} genes \textit{alr1482} (Type III-D) or \textit{alr1566} (Type I-D) and tested the specificities of the two corresponding enzymes in the resulting mutant strains, as recombinant proteins and in a cell-free transcription-translation system. The results assign the direct repeats (DRs) to three different groups. While Alr1566 is specific for one group, Alr1482 has a higher preference for the DRs of the second group but can also cleave those of the first group. We found that this cross-recognition limits crRNA accumulation for the Type I-D system \textit{in vivo}. We also show that the DR of the \textit{cas} gene-free CRISPR array of cyanophage N-1 is processed by these enzymes, suggesting that it is fully competent in association with host-encoded Cas proteins. The data support the functionality of CRISPR arrays that frequently appear fragmented to multiple genomic loci in multicellular cyanobacteria and disfavour other possibilities, such as the nonfunctionality of these orphan repeat-spacer arrays. Our results show the functional coordination of Cas6 endonucleases with both neighbouring and remote repeat-spacer arrays in the CRISPR-Cas system of cyanobacteria.},

 abstract = {IntroductionTheobroma cacao, the cocoa tree, is a target for pathogens, such as fungi from the genera Phytophthora, Moniliophthora, Colletotrichum, Ceratocystis, among others. Some cacao pathogens are restricted to specific regions of the world, such as the Cacao swollen shoot virus (CSSV) in West African countries, while others are expanding geographically, such as Moniliophthora roreri in the Americas. M. roreri is one of the most threatening cacao pathogens since it directly attacks the cacao pods driving a significant reduction in production, and therefore economic losses. Despite its importance, the knowledge about the microenvironment of this pathogen and the cocoa pods is still poorly characterized.MethodsHerein we performed RNA sequencing of spores in differential stages of culture in a medium supplemented with cacao pod extract and mycelium collected of the susceptible variety ICT 7121 naturally infected by the pathogen to evaluate the diversity and transcriptional activity of microorganisms associated with the in vitro sporulation of M. roreri.ResultsOur data revealed a great variety of fungi and bacteria associated with M. roreri, with an exceptional diversity of individuals from the genus Trichoderma sp. Interestingly, the dynamics of microorganisms from different kingdoms varied proportionally, suggesting they are somehow affected by M. roreri culture time. We also identified three sequences similar to viral genomes from the Narnaviridae family, posteriorly confirmed by phylogenetic analysis as members of the genus Narnavirus. Screening of M. roreri public datasets indicated the virus sequences circulating in samples from Ecuador, suggesting a wide spread of these elements. Of note, we did not identify traces of the viral sequences in the M. roreri genome or DNA sequencing, restricting the possibility of these sequences representing endogenized elements.DiscussionTo the best of our knowledge, this is the first report of viruses infecting the fungus of the genus Moniliophthora and only the third description of viruses that are able to parasite elements from the Marasmiaceae family.},

It indicates fecal contamination in water and food and serves as a marker of antimicrobial resistance. In this context, 61 extended-spectrum β-lactamase (ESBL)-producing E. coli from irrigation water and fresh produce from previous studies were characterized using whole genome sequencing (Illumina MiSeq). The Center for Genomic Epidemiology and Galaxy platforms were used to determine antimicrobial resistance genes, virulence genes, plasmid typing, mobile genetic elements, multilocus sequence typing (MLST), and pathogenicity prediction. In total, 19 known MLST groups were detected among the 61 isolates. Phylogroup B1 (ST58) and Phylogroup E (ST9583) were the most common sequence types. The six ST10 (serotype O101:H9) isolates carried the most resistance genes, spanning eight antibiotic classes. Overall, 95.1\% of the isolates carried resistance genes from three or more classes. The blaCTX-M-1, blaCTX-M-14, and blaCTX-M-15 ESBL genes were associated with mobile genetic elements, and all of the E. coli isolates showed a {\textgreater}90\% predicted probability of being a human pathogen. This study provided novel genomic information on environmental multidrug-resistant ESBL-producing E. coli from fresh produce and irrigation water, highlighting the environment as a reservoir for multidrug-resistant strains and emphasizing the need for ongoing pathogen surveillance within a One Health context.},

Here, we analyzed the full complement of cellular RNAs and proteins using gradient profiling by sequencing (Grad-seq) in Synechocystis 6803. Complexes with overlapping subunits such as the CpcG1-type versus the CpcL-type phycobilisomes or the PsaK1 versus PsaK2 photosystem I pre(complexes) could be distinguished, supporting the high quality of this approach. Clustering of the in-gradient distribution profiles followed by several additional criteria yielded a short list of potential RNA chaperones that include an YlxR homolog and a cyanobacterial homolog of the KhpA/B complex. The data suggest previously undetected complexes between accessory proteins and CRISPR-Cas systems, such as a Csx1-Csm6 ribonucleolytic defense complex. Moreover, the exclusive association of either RpoZ or 6S RNA with the core RNA polymerase complex and the existence of a reservoir of inactive sigma-antisigma complexes is suggested. The Synechocystis Grad-seq resource is available online at https://sunshine.biologie.uni-freiburg.de/GradSeqExplorer/ providing a comprehensive resource for the functional assignment of RNA-protein complexes and multisubunit protein complexes in a photosynthetic organism.},

@article{riesle_activator-blocker_2023,
 abstract = {Zygotic genome activation (ZGA) in the development of flies, fish, frogs and mammals depends on pioneer-like transcription factors (TFs). Those TFs create open chromatin regions, promote histone acetylation on enhancers, and activate transcription. Here, we use the panel of single, double and triple mutants for zebrafish genome activators Pou5f3, Sox19b and Nanog, multi-omics and mathematical modeling to investigate the combinatorial mechanisms of genome activation. We show that Pou5f3 and Nanog act differently on synergistic and antagonistic enhancer types. Pou5f3 and Nanog both bind as pioneer-like TFs on synergistic enhancers, promote histone acetylation and activate transcription. Antagonistic enhancers are activated by binding of one of these factors. The other TF binds as non-pioneer-like TF, competes with the activator and blocks all its effects, partially or completely. This activator-blocker mechanism mutually restricts widespread transcriptional activation by Pou5f3 and Nanog and prevents premature expression of late developmental regulators in the early embryo.},

Nevertheless, bark decomposes in nature, though by which species and mechanisms remains unknown. Here, we have followed the development of microbial enrichments growing on spruce bark over six months, by monitoring both chemical changes in the material and performing community and metagenomic analyses. Carbohydrate metabolism was unexpectedly limited, and instead a key activity was metabolism of extractives. Resin acid degradation was principally linked to community diversification with specific bacteria revealed to dominate the process. Metagenome-guided isolation facilitated the recovery of the dominant enrichment strain in pure culture, which represents a new species (Pseudomonas abieticivorans sp. nov.), that can grow on resin acids as a sole carbon source. Our results illuminate key stages in degradation of an abundant renewable resource, and how defensive extractive compounds have major roles in shaping microbiomes.},

@article{ritson_repeated_2025,
 abstract = {The mechanism by which chronic systemic inflammation contributes to cerebral endothelial dysfunction and neurological disorders is unclear, although endothelial inflammatory signalling is considered a cornerstone of this process. Here, we have performed transcriptomic analysis of published RNASeq datasets and identified consistent upregulation of the Tumour Necrosis Factor—C-X-C Motif Chemokine Ligand 10 (TNF-CXCL10) signalling pathway in mouse cerebral endothelial cells following a single inflammatory challenge. We subsequently investigated the effects of repeated low-level inflammation on the modulation of this pathway in a mouse cerebral endothelial cell line, analysing the effect on markers of endothelial cell activation and changes in cellular function, as a potential mechanism underlying the cerebrovascular response to low-level systemic inflammation. Mouse cerebral endothelial cells (bEnd.3) were exposed to hour-long treatments with phosphate buffered saline (PBS), a single low concentration of TNF (0.5 ng/mL), repeated low-concentration TNF (0.5 ng/mL, 1 h × 4 days) or a single cumulative concentration of TNF (2.0 ng/mL). RNA and protein were extracted 4 and 24 h after the final treatment for analysis of gene/protein expression using qRT-PCR and western blotting. Repeated inflammatory challenge significantly upregulated both Intercellular Adhesion Molecule 1 (ICAM1) and CXCL10 at the mRNA and protein levels. Signal transducer and activator of transcription 1 (STAT1) and phosphorylated-STAT1 (pSTAT1) protein levels were also increased at 4 and 24 h. Differentially, tumor necrosis factor receptor-associated factor 2 (TRAF2) and Interferon gamma (IFNγ) gene expression were decreased at 4 h, returning to control levels at 24 h. Functional analysis revealed significant increases in endothelial cell proliferation and apoptosis in the presence of repeated TNF exposure. CXCL10 knockdown with small interfering RNA (siRNA) reduced mean caspase 3/7 activity induced by the repeated inflammatory paradigm. These data suggest an upregulation of the TNF-CXCL10 pathway in response to low-level repetitive inflammation in mouse cerebral endothelial cells. Modulation of this pathway may represent a broad therapeutic target for neurovascular disease.},

 abstract = {For 25 years, analysis of the \textit{gp60} gene has been the cornerstone of \textit{Cryptosporidium} subtyping, particularly for \textit{Cryptosporidium hominis} and \textit{Cryptosporidium parvum}, during population-based and epidemiological studies. This gene, which encodes a 60 kDa glycoprotein, is highly polymorphic with several variable features that make it particularly useful for differentiating within \textit{Cryptosporidium} species. However, while this variability has proven useful for subtyping, it has on occasion resulted in alternative interpretations, and descriptions of novel and unusual features have been added to the nomenclature system, resulting in inconsistency and confusion. The components of the \textit{gp60} gene sequence used in the nomenclature that are discussed here include "R" repeats, "r" repeats, alphabetical suffixes, "variant" designations, and the use of the Greek alphabet as a family designation. As the subtyping scheme has expanded over the years, its application to different \textit{Cryptosporidium} species has also made the scheme more complex. For example, key features may be absent, such as the typical TCA/TCG/TCT serine microsatellite that forms a major part of the nomenclature in \textit{C. hominis} and \textit{C. parvum}. As is to be expected in such a variable gene, different primer sets have been developed for the amplification of the \textit{gp60} in various species and these have been collated. Here we bring together all the current components of \textit{gp60}, including a guide to the nomenclature in various species, software to assist in analysing sequences, and links to useful reference resources with an aim to promote standardisation of this subtyping tool.},

Combinations of the double and triple bHLH10,89,91 mutants were analysed under normal (200 μmol m–2 s–1) and low (50 μmol m–2 s–1) light conditions to determine the impact on fertility. Transcriptomic analysis of a new conditionally sterile bhlh89,91 double mutant shows differential regulation of genes related to sexual reproduction, hormone signal transduction, and lipid storage and metabolism under low light. Here we have shown that bHLH89 and bHLH91 play a role in regulating fertility in response to light, suggesting that they function in mitigating environmental variation to ensure fertility is maintained under environmental stress.},

 abstract = {Essential genes are deemed crucial for survival and/or reproductive success, hence, their loss of function leads to lethality. However, gene essentiality is not static, but dependent on multiple factors, including the genetic background. The genetic background affects gene essentiality through genetic modifiers, second-site variants capable of interacting with the primary variant and altering phenotype. Genetic modifiers can act as suppressors, alleviating the phenotype, or enhancers, exacerbating the phenotype. The plasticity (modification) of gene essentiality caused by genetic modifiers has been shown in multiple species. In Caenorhabditis elegans, recent evidence shows phenotypic variability for knock-down of essential genes in two natural isolates: N2 and CB4856. N2 represents the laboratory-cultivated strain, while CB4856 is one of the strains with most diverse genome in comparison to N2. Much has been explored for these two genetic backgrounds, but little is known about the plasticity of gene essentiality in other C. elegans wild isolates. Thus, I here explore the effect of the genetic background on the plasticity of two genes, known as essential in the N2 background, but potentially dispensable in CB4856: the Metaphase-to-Anaphase Transition Defect gene (mat-1), and the Conserved Germline Helicase (cgh-1). These are involved in cell division and posttranscriptional regulation, respectively. Here, I further investigate the plasticity of mat-1 and cgh-1 in N2 and CB4856 backgrounds, and also include four other wild isolate backgrounds from diverse geographical locations (GXW1, KR314, JU1400, and AB1). Using hatch rate and propagation assays, I explored the phenotype of mat-1 and cgh-1 knockdowns across the six natural isolates using temperature-sensitive alleles and uncovered phenotypic variability for the embryonic lethal phenotype, suggestively due to influence of each genetic background. Next, bioinformatics and genomics tools were utilized for identification of candidate genetic modifiers for mat-1 and cgh-1 and led to prioritization of eight extragenic variants. Out of these, none showed notable modifying activity when studied in isolation. Importantly, this work shows the challenges associated with identifying true genetic modifiers in genomes with substantial variation. Undeniably, understanding more about a gene and its phenotype under different conditions and genetic backgrounds may be fundamental for elucidating fixed and plastic genetic interactions.},

composite microbial community associated with Culicoides reevesi biting 
midges from Buenaventura municipality in the state of Chihuahua, Mexico, 
using a Sanger sequencing 16s rRNA metagenomics approach. Adult 
females of Culicoides reevesi were collected by human landing catches 
in the rainy season of 2023 and morphologically identified. They were 
grouped into pools of 25 individuals from which genomic DNA (gDNA) was 
extracted. Sanger sequencing of 16S rRNA was performed for a total of 
4 pools, and the amplicon sequencing of the V3-V4 hypervariable region 
was done on Illumina Mseq platform to detect bacterial communities. The 
bioinformatic analysis included quality assessment, taxonomic classification, 
and visualization. The evaluation of the microbial community involved 
assessing taxa abundance and diversity using Mothur and QIIME2 software 
included in Galaxy Tool Shed (https://usegalaxy.eu/). Our study presents, 
for the first time in México and worldwide, an in-depth analysis of the 
bacteriome composition in C. reevesi, utilizing a 16S rRNA metagenomic 
approach. We emphasize the prevalence of dominant bacterial phyla, 
particularly Proteobacteria, alongside varying abundances of Actinobacteria, 
Firmicutes, Acidobacteria, and Bacteroidota, with a notable occurrence 
of Tenericutes. We identified intriguing species of both human and animal 
pathogenic bacteria. Moreover, we observed the absence of unidentified 
bacterial sequences, alongside the presence of other bacterial groups 
associated with the environment or plants. This has implications for both 
healthcare and ecological management, potentially simplifying control 
measures but also posing risks if the dominant species are harmful. This 
research enhances our understanding of the microbiome associated with 
Culicoides species, such as Culicoides reevesi, underscoring the need for 
further investigation to fully grasp their ecological importance and impact on 
public health.},

SC behavior is related to endogenous expression of the myogenic transcription factor MYF5 and the propensity to enter into the cell cycle. Here, we report a role for miR-106b reinforcing MYF5 inhibition and blocking cell proliferation in a subset of highly quiescent SC population. miR-106b down-regulation occurs during SC activation and is required for proper muscle repair. In addition, miR-106b is increased in dystrophic mice, and intramuscular injection of antimiR in injured mdx mice enhances muscle regeneration promoting transcriptional changes involved in skeletal muscle differentiation. miR-106b inhibition promotes the engraftment of human muscle stem cells. Furthermore, miR-106b is also high in human dystrophic muscle stem cells and its inhibition improves intrinsic proliferative defects and increases their myogenic potential. This study demonstrates that miR-106b is an important modulator of SC quiescence, and that miR-106b may be a new target to develop therapeutic strategies to promote muscle regeneration improving the regenerative capabilities of injured dystrophic muscle.},

We identify elongation of primary cilia in distal renal tubules in the context of glomerular nephropathy. In renal biopsies and mouse models, tubular injury correlates with ciliary elongation, tubule dilation, and disruption of the cortical actin cytoskeleton. In vitro studies implicate biophysical cues of the glomerular filtrate and subsequent dysregulation of the actin cytoskeleton as contributing factors, confirmed by conditional deletion of N-WASP and Arp2/3 in vivo and in vitro. Electron and fluorescence microscopy revealed enlarged ciliary pockets, basal body mislocalization, and intracellular cilia formation in

Transcriptome analysis identifies the essential role of cilia in maintaining adaptive tubular cell states, while persistent activation leads to disease progression through extracellular matrix remodeling, exemplified by Tenascin-C. Our findings establish cilia as central mediators of tubular adaptation to injury and identify the Arp2/3-dependent actin cytoskeleton as a critical regulator, providing essential insights into the pathogenesis of chronic kidney disease.

Identification of podocyte-specific signaling pathways is therefore a prerequisite to characterizing relevant disease pathways and developing novel treatment approaches. Here, we employed loss of function studies for EPB41L5 (Yurt) as a central podocyte gene to generate a cell type-specific disease model. Loss of Yurt in fly nephrocytes caused protein uptake and slit diaphragm defects. Transcriptomic and proteomic analysis of human EPB41L5 knockout podocytes demonstrated impaired mechanotransduction via the YAP/TAZ signaling pathway. Further analysis of specific inhibition of the YAP/TAZ-TEAD transcription factor complex by TEADi led to the identification of ARGHAP29 as an EPB41L5 and YAP/TAZ-dependently expressed podocyte RhoGAP. Knockdown of ARHGAP29 caused increased RhoA activation, defective lamellipodia formation, and increased maturation of integrin adhesion complexes, explaining similar phenotypes caused by loss of EPB41L5 and TEADi expression in podocytes. Detection of increased levels of ARHGAP29 in early disease stages of human glomerular disease implies a novel negative feedback loop for mechanotransductive RhoA—YAP/TAZ signaling in podocyte physiology and disease.},

 abstract = {Unmanaged plastic waste in Sub-Saharan Africa pollutes large areas and degrades into microplastics (MPs). Surfaces of MP are colonized by bacteria and fungi, resulting in the plastisphere. Plastispheres from high population hotspots on the African continent enrich pathogenic fungi, posing a potential threat to human health. Prokaryotes in such plastispheres are unknown to date. Thus, we analysed the prokaryotic microbiome of native plastisphere and soil by 16S rRNA gene amplicon sequencing, with a focus on community assembly mechanisms and putative pathogenic bacteria. A strong plastic-dependent depletion of archaeal ammonia oxidizing Nitrososphaeraceae was observed. Prokaryotic but not archaeal beta diversity significantly differed between plastisphere and soil microbiomes. The prokaryotic pathogenic potential in the plastisphere was marginally increased relative to soil, suggesting that MP is a driver for fungal rather than bacterial pathogens. Null model comparisons revealed a moderately stronger effect of deterministic selection events in the plastisphere than in soil. We observed a severe disruption of cooccurrence network connectivity in plastisphere communities in contrast to bulk soil communities. This study closes the knowledge gap on plastic debris in Sub-Saharan terrestrial environments, and the observed effects on archaea and cooccurrence networks suggest negative impacts on nitrification and stability of microbial communities.},

 abstract = {The genome of
Arabidopsis thaliana
consists of 10 chromosomes. By inducing CRISPR-Cas–mediated breaks at subcentromeric and subtelomeric sequences, we fused entire chromosome arms, obtaining two eight-chromosome lines. In one line, both arms of chromosome 3 were fused to chromosome 1. In another line, the arms were transferred to chromosomes 1 and 5. Both chromosome number–reduced lines were fertile. Phenotypic and transcriptional analyses revealed no differences compared with wild-type plants. After crossing with the wild type, the progeny showed reduced fertility. The meiotic recombination patterns of the transferred chromosome arms were substantially changed. Directed chromosome number changes in plants may enable new breeding strategies, redefining linkage groups and establishing genetic barriers. Moreover, our data indicate that plants are highly robust to engineered karyotype changes.

Editor’s summary

Restructuring chromosomes alters inheritance patterns of genetic information. In plants, chromosomal rearrangements can reproductively isolate engineered plants from wild relatives or can change the inheritance of desirable agronomic traits. Rönspies
et al
. used the model plant
Arabidopsis thaliana
as a testbed to implement CRISPR-Cas technology to fuse chromosomes together (see the Perspective by Zhang and Dawe). The researchers generated plants with eight chromosomes instead of 10, which appeared to be phenotypically normal and were self-fertile. Altered recombination patterns illustrated the changes to genetic inheritance rules. This work opens avenues for large-scale chromosomal changes in plants and provides insights into the plasticity of plant genomes. —Madeleine Seale},

Stress-induced TE mobilization is of particular interest because it may result in novel gene regulatory pathways responding to stresses and thereby contribute to stress adaptation. Here, we investigated the genomic impacts of stress induced TE mobilization in wild type Arabidopsis plants. We find that the heat-stress responsive ONSEN TE displays an insertion site preference that is associated with specific chromatin states, especially those rich in H2A.Z histone variant and H3K27me3 histone mark. In order to better understand how novel ONSEN insertions affect the plant's response to heat stress, we carried out an in-depth transcriptomic analysis. We find that in addition to simple gene knockouts, ONSEN can produce a plethora of gene expression changes such as: constitutive activation of gene expression, alternative splicing, acquisition of heat-responsiveness, exonisation and genesis of novel non-coding and antisense RNAs. This report shows how the mobilization of a single TE-family can lead to a rapid rise of its copy number increasing the host's genome size and contribute to a broad range of transcriptomic novelty on which natural selection can then act.},

In the mouse ovary, oestrogen receptors and FOXL2 protect ovarian granulosa cells from transdifferentiation into Sertoli cells, their testicular counterpart. However, the mechanism underlying their protective effect is unknown. Here, we show that TRIM28 is required to prevent female-to-male sex reversal of the mouse ovary after birth. We found that upon loss of Trim28, ovarian granulosa cells transdifferentiate to Sertoli cells through an intermediate cell type, different from gonadal embryonic progenitors. TRIM28 is recruited on chromatin in the proximity of FOXL2 to maintain the ovarian pathway and to repress testicular-specific genes. The role of TRIM28 in ovarian maintenance depends on its E3-SUMO ligase activity that regulates the sex-specific SUMOylation profile of ovarian-specific genes. Our study identifies TRIM28 as a key factor in protecting the adult ovary from the testicular pathway.},

Despite increasing documentation of Klebsiella-targeting phages, clinical applications remain limited, with key phage–bacteria interactions still poorly understood. A major obstacle is fragmented access to well-characterised phage–bacteria pairings, restricting the collective advancement of therapeutic and mechanistic insights. To address this gap, we created the Klebsiella Phage Collection (KlebPhaCol), an open resource comprising 52 phages and 74 Klebsiella isolates, characterised at phenotypic and genomic levels. These phages span six families—including a novel family, Felixviridae, associated with the human gut—and target 20 sequence types (including ST258, ST11, and ST14) and 19 capsular-locus types (including KL1 and KL2), across 6 Klebsiella species. Freely accessible at www.klebphacol.org, KlebPhaCol invites the scientific community to both use and contribute to this resource, fostering collaborative research and a deeper understanding of Klebsiella-phage interactions beyond therapeutic use.Multidrug-resistant Klebsiella pneumoniae is a critical global health challenge. Bacteriophages (phages) could offer new therapies, but progress has been slowed by fragmented resources. KlebPhaCol addresses this gap as the first open, community-driven Klebsiella phage collection. It brings together physical samples (52 phages and 74 Klebsiella isolates) alongside extensive genomic, phenotypic, and host-range data, all freely accessible via www.klebphacol.org. The collection includes globally relevant clones, spans six phage families, and revealed a new gut-associated phage family, Felixviridae. Crucially, KlebPhaCol is designed to grow: researchers worldwide can deposit new strains and phages or add fresh analyses to existing ones, creating a sustainable platform for therapeutic development and fundamental microbiology.},

 abstract = {Unintegrated HIV DNA represents between 20\% and 35\% of the total viral DNA in infected patients. Only the linear forms (unintegrated linear DNAs [ULDs]) can be substrates for integration and for the completion of a full viral cycle. In quiescent cells, these ULDs may be responsible for pre-integrative latency. However, their detection remains difficult due to the lack of specificity and sensitivity of existing techniques. We developed an ultra-sensitive, specific, and high-throughput technology for ULD quantification called DUSQ (DNA ultra-sensitive quantification) combining linker-mediated PCR and next-generation sequencing (NGS) using molecular barcodes. Studying cells with different activity levels, we determined that the ULD half-life goes up to 11 days in resting CD4+ T cells. Finally, we were able to quantify ULDs in samples from patients infected with HIV-1, providing a proof of concept for the use of DUSQ in vivo to track pre-integrative latency. DUSQ can be adapted to the detection of other rare DNA molecules.},

These enzymes are collectively known as carbohydrate-active enzymes (CAZymes), crucial for growth, colonization and pathogenesis. Therefore, the present study was aimed to identify and annotate pathogen CAZymes in the xylem sap of a susceptible tomato variety using downstream proteomics and meta servers. Further, structural elucidation and conformational stability analysis of the selected CAZyme families were done through homology modeling and molecular dynamics simulation. Among all the fungal proteins identified, the carbohydrate metabolic process was found to be enriched. Most of the annotated CAZymes belonged to the hydrolase and oxidoreductase families, and 90\% were soluble and extracellular. Moreover, using a publically available interactome database, interactions were observed between the families acting on chitin, hemicellulose and pectin. Subsequently, important catalytic residues were identified in the candidate CAZymes belonging to carbohydrate esterase (CE8) and glycosyl hydrolase (GH18 and GH28). Further, essential dynamics after molecular simulation of 100 ns revealed the overall behavior of these CAZymes with distinct global minima and transition states in CE8. Thus, our study identified some of the CAZyme families that assist in pathogenesis and growth through host cell wall deconstruction with further structural insight into the selected CAZyme families.

The 12 populations from the Plaine des Lacs, which show remarkable genetic diversity among themselves, were identified as B. spinogibbaDefaye, 1998, the only species of its genus known from New Caledonia until now. The sole exception, the population from Mont-Dore 22 km further east, appeared genetically and morphologically distinct from the others and is described herein as a new species. The two species are distinguished from each other by the shapes of the male and female P5, female Th5, and body colour. A previously published key is amended to separate the species. Our concatenated COI+28S phylogeny places the two New Caledonia species as a new branch within Boeckella, distinct from the branches consisting of South American, Antarctic and Australasian species. All 13 Boeckella populations inhabit the extreme south of New Caledonia, an area known for endemism and high heavy metal concentrations in the soil. Extensive mining activity in this metal-rich area, begun in 1873, is now leading to conflict with conservation goals. By using aerial photographs to trace the fate of the pond that is the type locality of B. spinogibba, we confirmed that it disappeared between 2007 and 2014 as a result of the expansion of the Goro nickel mine.},

However, organoids grown in droplets typically display only a spherical geometry and lack the intricate structural complexity found in native tissue. By incorporating singularized pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma cells into collagen droplets, we achieve the growth of branched structures, indicating a more complex interaction with the surrounding hydrogel. A comparison of organoid growth in droplets of different diameters showed that while geometrical confinement improves organoid homogeneity, it also impairs the formation of more complex organoid morphologies. Thus, only in 750 µm diameter collagen droplets did we achieve the consistent growth of highly branched structures with a morphology closely resembling the structural complexity achieved in traditional bulk organoid culture. Moreover, our analysis of organoid morphology and transcriptomic data suggests an accelerated maturation of organoids cultured in collagen droplets, highlighting a shift in developmental timing compared to traditional systems.},

A phylogenetic analysis using the protein-coding gene sequences from available Dolichoderinae mitogenomes supports the monophyletic nature of the genus \textit{Tapinoma}, with the \textit{T. nigerrimum} complex forming a well-supported clade. Key findings include genetic traits unique to the \textit{T. nigerrimum} complex, such as a start codon in the \textit{atp8} gene and a complete stop codon in \textit{cox1}, distinguishing them from other \textit{Tapinoma} species. Additionally, a gene rearrangement involving \textit{tRNA-Trp}, \textit{tRNA-Cys}, and \textit{tRNA-Tyr} was found exclusively in the \textit{Tapinoma} species, suggesting a potential phylogenetic marker for the genus.},

Yet, for many ubiquitous microbes, there is limited knowledge regarding the identity and function of secreted proteins. Here, we introduce EXCRETE (enhanced exoproteome characterization by mass spectrometry), a workflow that enables comprehensive description of microbial exoproteomes from minimal starting material. Using cyanobacteria as a case study, we benchmark EXCRETE and show a significant increase over current methods in the identification of extracellular proteins. Subsequently, we show that EXCRETE can be miniaturized and adapted to a 96-well high-throughput format. Application of EXCRETE to cyanobacteria from different habitats (Synechocystis sp. PCC 6803, Synechococcus sp. PCC 11901, and Nostoc punctiforme PCC 73102), and in different cultivation conditions, identified up to 85\% of all potentially secreted proteins. Finally, functional analysis reveals that cell envelope maintenance and nutrient acquisition are central functions of the predicted cyanobacterial secretome. Collectively, these findings challenge the general belief that cyanobacteria lack secretory proteins and suggest that multiple functions of the secretome are conserved across freshwater, marine, and terrestrial species.},

@article{sabala_carbapenem_2024,
 abstract = {Background
Carbapenem-resistant Klebsiella pneumoniae (CRKP) is a great public health problem and is associated with many disease outbreaks and high mortality rates. Alarmingly, K. pneumoniae has been isolated from food in several recent studies. This study aimed to investigate the prevalence and characteristics of CRKP in food samples from Egypt.
Methods
A total of 311 food samples (including 116 minced meat, 92 chicken meat, 75 diced meat, and 28 mutton) were collected from local markets in Egypt and were screened for CRKP with the determination of their antimicrobial resistance profiles. The whole genome sequence was done for 23 CRKP isolates to clarify the relationship between CRKP from food and human cases in Egypt using the SNP core genome. The conjugation probability of the blaNDM-5 harboring plasmid was identified using oriTfinder
Results
CRKP was isolated from 11\% (35/311) of the samples, with 45.71\% (16/35) of them showing resistance to colistin, one of the last-resort options for treating CRKP-mediated infections. In addition to the carbapenem and colistin resistance, the CRKP isolates frequently exhibited resistance to multiple antimicrobials including β-lactams, fluoroquinolones, aminoglycosides, tetracyclines, and chloramphenicol. In addition, most of the CRKP were potentially hypervirulent K. pneumoniae (HvKP) identified as phylogroup Kp1 and of high-risk groups as detected in STs reported in many human outbreaks globally, such as ST383 and ST147. The core-genome phylogeny showed similarities between the isolates from this study and those previously isolated from clinical human samples in Egypt. In addition, analysis of the plasmid on which blaNDM is encoded revealed that several antimicrobial resistance genes such as blaOXA-9, blaCTX-M-15, aac(6′)-Ib, qnrS1, and several virulence genes are encoded on the same plasmid.
Conclusions
This study is significant for food safety and public health and is important to further identify the change in the epidemiology of CRKP infections, especially the consumption of contaminated food products.},

 abstract = {Introduction: MicroRNAs have a significant role in the regulation of the transcriptome. Several miRNAs have been proposed as potential biomarkers in different malignancies. However, contradictory results have been reported on the capability of miRNA biomarkers in cancer detection. The human biological clock involves molecular mechanisms that regulate several genes over time. Therefore, the sampling time becomes one of the significant factors in gene expression studies.Method: In the present study, we have tried to find miRNAs with minimum fluctuation in expression levels at different time points that could be more accurate candidates as diagnostic biomarkers. The small RNA-seq raw data of ten healthy individuals across nine-time points were analyzed to identify miRNAs with stable expression.Results: We have found five oscillation patterns. The stable miRNAs were investigated in 779 small-RNA-seq datasets of eleven cancer types. All miRNAs with the highest differential expression were selected for further analysis. The selected miRNAs were explored for functional pathways. The predominantly enriched pathways were miRNA in cancer and the P53-signaling pathway. Finally, we have found seven miRNAs, including miR-142-3p, miR-199a-5p, miR-223-5p, let-7d-5p, miR-148b-3p, miR-340-5p, and miR-421. These miRNAs showed minimum fluctuation in healthy blood and were dysregulated in the blood of eleven cancer types. Conclusion: We have found a signature of seven stable miRNAs which dysregulate in several cancer types and may serve as potential pan-cancer biomarkers.},

We further demonstrated a requirement of the metabolite for the activity of \textit{B. hordei} transketolase, an enzyme of central carbon metabolism known to be thiamine-dependent in other organisms. Taken together, our data suggest that thiamine is a vitamin for \textit{B. hordei} and, thus, likely all powdery mildew fungi.},

@phdthesis{sabrina_statistical_2020,
 abstract = {Protein-RNA interactions play an important role in all post-transcriptional regulatory processes. High throughput detection of protein-RNA interactions has been facilitated by the emerging CLIP-seq (crosslinking and immunoprecipitation combined with high-throughput sequencing) techniques. Enrichments in mapped reads as well as base transitions or deletions at crosslink sites can be used to infer binding regions. Single-nucleotide resolution techniques (iCLIP and eCLIP) have been achieved by capturing high fractions of cDNAs which are truncated at protein-RNA crosslink sites. Increasing numbers of datasets and derivatives of these protocols have been published in recent years, requiring tailored computational analyses. Existing methods unfortunately do not explicitly model the specifics of truncation patterns and possible biases caused by background binding or crosslinking sequence preferences. 
We present PureCLIP, a hidden Markov model based approach, which simultaneously performs peak calling and individual crosslink site detection. It is capable of incorporating external data to correct for non-specific background signals and, for the first time, for the crosslinking biases. We devised a comprehensive evaluation based on three strategies. Firstly, we developed a workflow to simulate iCLIP data, which starts from real RNA-seq data and known binding regions and then mimics the experimental steps of the iCLIP protocol, including the generation of background signals. Secondly, we used experimental iCLIP and eCLIP datasets, using the proteins’ known predominant binding regions. And thirdly, we assessed the agreement of called sites between replicates, assuming target-specific signals are reproducible between replicates. 
On both simulated and real data, PureCLIP is consistently more precise in calling crosslink sites than other state-of-the-art methods. In particular when incorporating input control data and crosslink associated motifs (CL-motifs) PureCLIP is up to 13\% more precise than other methods and we show that it has an up to 20\% higher agreement across replicates. Moreover, our method can optionally merge called crosslink sites to binding regions based on their distance and we show that the resulting regions reflect the known binding regions with high-resolution. 
Additionally, we demonstrate that our method achieves a high precision robustly over a range of different settings and performs well for proteins with different binding characteristics. Lastly, we extended the method to include individual CLIP replicates and show that this can boost the precision even further. PureCLIP and its documenta- tion are publicly available at https://github.com/skrakau/PureCLIP.},

An IncC plasmid carrying the blaNDM-1 gene also carried the rare rmtC gene, encoding for 16S rRNA methyltransferases (16RMTases), conferring resistance to all aminoglycosides. The global spread of New Delhi metallo (NDM) variants and their association with the 16RMTases among K. pneumoniae complete genomes available in GenBank was studied, and a complete overview of the association of 16RMTases and NDM in K. pneumoniae genomics was produced. NDM is often associated with16RMTases, and both are spreading in K. pneumoniae, conferring resistance to all beta-lactams and aminoglycosides. This analysis suggests that aminoglycosides have a limited future as a second-line treatment against NDM-producing K. pneumoniae.},

Early detection of ER+ and TNBC is crucial in the choice of diagnosis and appropriate treatment strategy. Here we report the key genes associated to ER+ and TNBC using RNA-Seq analysis and machine learning models. Three ER+ and TNBC RNA seq datasets comprising 164 patients in-toto were selected for standard NGS hierarchical data processing and data analyses protocols. Enrichment pathway analysis and network analysis was done and finally top hub genes were identified. To come with a reliable classifier which could distinguish the distinct transcriptome patterns associated to ER+ and TNBC, ML models were built employing Naïve Bayes, SVM and kNN. 1730 common DEG’s exhibiting significant logFC values with 0.05 p-value threshold were identified. A list of top ten hub genes were screened on the basis of maximal clique centrality (MCC) which included CDC20, CDK1, BUB1, AURKA, CDCA8, RRM2, TTK, CENPF, CEP55 and NDC80.These genes were found to be involved in crucial cell cycle pathways. k-Nearest Neighbor (kNN) model was observed to be best classifier with accuracy 84\%, specificity 66\% and sensitivity 95\% to differentiate between ER+ and TNBC RNA-Seq transcriptomes. Our screened list of 10 hub genes can thus help unearth novel molecular signatures implicated in ER+ and TNBC onset, prognosis and design of novel protocols for breast cancer diagnostics and therapeutics.},

 abstract = {Shoot growth directly impacts plant productivity. Plants adjust their shoot growth in response to varying environments to maximize resource capture and stress resilience. While several factors controlling shoot growth are known, the complexity of the regulation and the input of the environment are not fully understood. We have investigated shoot growth repression induced by low ambient temperatures in hybrids of Arabidopsis thaliana Kro-0 and BG-5 accessions. To continue our previous studies, we confirmed that the Kro-0 allele of DYNAMIN-RELATED PROTEIN 3B causes stunted shoot growth in the BG-5 background. We also found that shoot growth repression was most pronounced near the apex at a lower temperature and that the cells in the hybrid stem failed to elongate correctly. Furthermore, we observed that shoot growth repression in hybrids depended on light availability. Global gene expression analysis indicated the involvement of hormones, especially strigolactone, associated with the dwarf phenotype. Altogether, this study enhances our knowledge on the genetic, physiological and environmental factors associated with shoot growth regulation.},

 abstract = {Little is known about virome changes in raw and drinking water over time, and differences between raw water sources and treatment technologies. This study used metagenomics to assess viruses prevalent in raw and drinking water samples over 1 year from six Swedish drinking water treatment plants (DWTPs) with varying treatment barriers and with different raw water sources. Sequences homologous to known viruses in the raw water samples were detected by amplification and next-generation sequencing and classified into 152 different virus species belonging to 76 virus families/orders. The majority were small bacteriophages. Other viral genomes were homologous to viruses infecting plants, invertebrates, vertebrates, mammals and giant viruses infecting amoeba or algae. Several virus species were simultaneously found in both raw and drinking water, indicating passage through the purification barriers, although reduced by 1-3 log10 after treatment. Most viruses detected in water samples after ultrafiltration were small viruses, and other barriers appeared more effective at removing smaller viruses. To avoid detecting viruses possibly replicating within DWTPs, viruses were separated according to the possibility that the host could be found in the water sources or not. These results underscore the importance of monitoring both raw and drinking water for small viruses, especially when viral contamination of the source water is at risk, to ensure drinking water quality.},

@article{sajulga_survey_2020,
 abstract = {To gain a thorough appreciation of microbiome dynamics, researchers characterize the functional relevance of expressed microbial genes or proteins. This can be accomplished through metaproteomics, which characterizes the protein expression of microbiomes. Several software tools exist for analyzing microbiomes at the functional level by measuring their combined proteome-level response to environmental perturbations. In this survey, we explore the performance of six available tools, to enable researchers to make informed decisions regarding software choice based on their research goals. Tandem mass spectrometry-based proteomic data obtained from dental caries plaque samples grown with and without sucrose in paired biofilm reactors were used as representative data for this evaluation. Microbial peptides from one sample pair were identified by the X! tandem search algorithm via SearchGUI and subjected to functional analysis using software tools including eggNOG-mapper, MEGAN5, MetaGOmics, MetaProteomeAnalyzer (MPA), ProPHAnE, and Unipept to generate functional annotation through Gene Ontology (GO) terms. Among these software tools, notable differences in functional annotation were detected after comparing differentially expressed protein functional groups. Based on the generated GO terms of these tools we performed a peptide-level comparison to evaluate the quality of their functional annotations. A BLAST analysis against the NCBI non-redundant database revealed that the sensitivity and specificity of functional annotation varied between tools. For example, eggNOG-mapper mapped to the most number of GO terms, while Unipept generated more accurate GO terms. Based on our evaluation, metaproteomics researchers can choose the software according to their analytical needs and developers can use the resulting feedback to further optimize their algorithms. To make more of these tools accessible via scalable metaproteomics workflows, eggNOG-mapper and Unipept 4.0 were incorporated into the Galaxy platform.},

Herein, we establish that dysfunction of the RNA binding protein heterogeneous nuclear ribonucleoprotein A1 (hnRNP A1) results in differential of binding to RNA targets causing alternative RNA splicing, which contributes to neurodegeneration in MS and its models. Using RNAseq of MS brains, we discovered differential expression and aberrant splicing of hnRNP A1 target RNAs involved in neuronal function and RNA homeostasis. We confirmed this in vivo in experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis employing CLIPseq specific for hnRNP A1, where hnRNP A1 differentially binds and regulates RNA, including aberrantly spliced targets identified in human samples. Additionally, dysfunctional hnRNP A1 expression in neurons caused neurite loss and identical changes in splicing, corroborating hnRNP A1 dysfunction as a cause of neurodegeneration. Collectively, these data indicate hnRNP A1 dysfunction causes altered neuronal RNA splicing, resulting in neurodegeneration in MS.},

Using a combination of Illumina-based whole genome sequencing, de novo assembly, and a multi-tool bioinformatics pipeline, we annotated antimicrobial resistance genes (ARGs), insertion sequences (ISs), and plasmid replicon types. Clinically significant resistance markers such as blaKPC, blaTEM, aacA4, tetA, and folP were identified, frequently co-localised with mobile genetic elements including IS110, IS4, and IS1182. The plasmid-associated contigs were assigned to MOBP and MOBQ types and contained replicon markers (IncP6, IncA/C2) characteristic of broad-host-range plasmids. Our findings provide valuable insight into the plasmidome of environmental Enterobacterales, emphasising the role of coastal pollution in shaping the distribution and potential mobility of antimicrobial resistance genes. This supports the One Health framework by linking environmental reservoirs to clinically relevant resistance mechanisms.},

@article{sanchez-leon_heteroresistance_2023,
 abstract = {Heteroresistance to colistin can be defined as the presence of resistant subpopulations in an isolate that is susceptible to this antibiotic. Colistin resistance in Gram-negative bacteria is more frequently related to chromosomal mutations and insertions. This work aimed to study heteroresistance in nine clinical isolates of Klebsiella pneumoniae producing OXA-48 and to describe genomic changes in mutants with acquired resistance in vitro. Antimicrobial susceptibility was determined by broth microdilution (BMD) and heteroresistance by population analysis profiling (PAP). The proteins related to colistin resistance were analyzed for the presence of mutations. Additionally, PCR of the mgrB gene was performed to identify the presence of insertions. In the nine parental isolates, the PAP method showed colistin heteroresistance of colonies growing on plates with concentrations of up to 64 mg/L, corresponding to stable mutant subpopulations. The MICs of some mutants from the PAP plate containing 4×MIC of colistin had absolute values of ≤2 mg/L that were higher than the parental MICs and were defined as persistent variants. PCR of the mgrB gene identified an insertion sequence that inactivated the gene in 21 mutants. Other substitutions in the investigated mutants were found in PhoP, PhoQ, PmrB, PmrC, CrrA and CrrB proteins. Colistin heteroresistance in K. pneumoniae isolates was attributed mainly to insertions in the mgrB gene and point mutations in colistin resistance proteins. The results of this study will improve understanding regarding the mechanisms of colistin resistance in mutants of K. pneumoniae producing OXA-48.},

En este trabajo se evalúa la HR a colistina en diversas cepas de Klebsiella pneumoniae con fenotipo silvestre (Kp-WT) y productoras de la carbapenemasa OXA-48 (Kp-OXA48). Para ello, la sensibilidad a colistina se determinó mediante microdilución en caldo (BMD) y la HR mediante análisis de perfil de población (PAP). Los mutantes resistentes se caracterizaron a nivel molecular mediante el análisis del genoma completo y PCR del gen mgrB para identificar la presencia de mutaciones en genes relacionados con la síntesis del lipopolisacárido. La BMD determino que todas las cepas estudiadas fueron sensibles a colistina y el método PAP mostro que las CMIs de algunos mutantes de la placa PAP que contenía 4×MIC de colistina tenían valores absolutos similares a las CMIs parentales y se definieron como variantes persistentes mientras que la HR a colistina de las colonias que crecían en placas con concentraciones de hasta 32-64 mg/L, correspondieron a subpoblaciones mutantes estables. La PCR del gen mgrB identifico diversas secuencias de inserción que inactivaba el gen en 14 mutantes de Kp-WT y en 21 mutantes de Kp-OXA48 pertenecientes principalmente a la familia IS1 (ISKpn14) and IS5 (ISKpn74). En los mutantes de Kp- WT se identificaron mutaciones puntuales en proteínas relacionadas con la síntesis del lipopolisacárido (MgrB, PhoP, PhoQ, PmrB, CrrA y CrrB). En los mutantes de Kp- OXA48 se identificaron también mutaciones puntuales en estas proteínas; la HR a colistina en estos aislados se atribuyó fundamentalmente a las inserciones y mutaciones puntuales detectadas. Los resultados de este estudio podrían mejorar la comprensión de los mecanismos de resistencia a colistina en mutantes de Kp-WT y Kp-OXA48.},

Here, we aim to understand a complex system, that is, segmentation timing in mouse embryos, without a reference to these detailed interactions. To this end, we develop a coarse-grained approach, in which theory guides the experimental identification of the segmentation clock entrainment responses. We demonstrate period- and phase-locking of the segmentation clock across a wide range of entrainment parameters, including higher-order coupling. These quantifications allow to derive the phase response curve (PRC) and Arnold tongues of the segmentation clock, revealing its essential dynamical properties. Our results indicate that the somite segmentation clock has characteristics reminiscent of a highly non-linear oscillator close to an infinite period bifurcation and suggests the presence of long-term feedbacks. Combined, this coarse-grained theoretical-experimental approach reveals how we can derive simple, essential features of a highly complex dynamical system, providing precise experimental control over the pace and rhythm of the somite segmentation clock.},

 abstract = {This research presents an innovative smart community interactive art therapy platform that integrates multimodal computer graphics with resilient artificial intelligence adaptation mechanisms to address the growing challenges of home-based elderly care. The platform employs a four-layered hierarchical architecture encompassing perception, network, platform, and application layers to deliver personalized therapeutic interventions. The system utilizes multimodal data fusion algorithms to process visual, auditory, and haptic inputs while implementing adaptive learning mechanisms that continuously optimize user experiences based on individual preferences and capabilities. Experimental validation demonstrates superior performance with response times averaging 387 ms under 100 concurrent users, therapeutic recommendation accuracy of 87.3\%, and user satisfaction scores of 4.2/5.0 across multiple evaluation dimensions. The resilient adaptation mechanisms achieved 99.7\% service availability and 34\% improvement in CPU utilization compared to conventional systems. Long-term usage tracking revealed sustained engagement patterns with minimal dropout rates over 6-month evaluation periods. The platform successfully addresses key limitations of traditional elderly care models by providing comprehensive support that encompasses cognitive stimulation, emotional well-being, and social connection while maintaining cost-effectiveness and scalability for large-scale deployment in smart community environments.},

@article{santos_wastewater_2025,
 abstract = {This study investigates viral composition in wastewater through metagenomic analysis, evaluating the performance of four bioinformatic tools—Genome Detective, CZ.ID, INSaFLU-TELEVIR and Trimmomatic + Kraken2—on samples collected from four sites in each of two wastewater treatment plants (WWTPs) in Lisbon, Portugal in April 2019. From each site, we collected and processed separately three replicates and one pool of nucleic acids extracted from the replicates. A total of 32 samples were processed using sequence-independent single-primer amplification (SISPA) and sequenced on an Illumina MiSeq platform. Across the 128 sample–tool combinations, viral read counts varied widely, from 3 to 288,464. There was a lack of consistency between replicates and their pools in terms of viral abundance and diversity, revealing the heterogeneity of the wastewater matrix and the variability in sequencing effort. There was also a difference between software tools highlighting the impact of tool selection on community profiling. A positive correlation between crAssphage and human pathogens was found, supporting crAssphage as a proxy for public health surveillance. A custom Python pipeline automated viral identification report processing, taxonomic assignments and diversity calculations, streamlining analysis and ensuring reproducibility. These findings emphasize the importance of sequencing depth, software tool selection and standardized pipelines in advancing wastewater-based epidemiology.},

 abstract = {Bacterial key species (BKS) is unique and found only in peat secondary forest, but not in converted peat areas. Its presence helps in biomonitoring of peatland quality. BKS candidates were detected based on the 16S rRNA gene sequence using the Next Generation Sequencing method. The 16S rRNA gene sequencing data were obtained from DNA isolated from peat soil of the secondary forest (SF), acacia plantations (AP), and rubber plantations (RP) in the Giam Siak Kecil - Bukit Batu (GSK-BB) Biosphere Reserve, Riau. The natural vegetation of peat swamp forest dominates the SF, which was relatively heterogeneous with anaerobic conditions and water level at 60-120 cm. The RP locations were planted with 6-7 year old rubber, water level was 20 cm, and the garden was not maintained. The AP locations were planted with A. crassicarpa and peat thickness was 9 m. The peat soil was sampled in August 2019. BKS candidates were selected based on a phylogenetic tree using MEGA 6.06 by observing the grouping of DNA sequences obtained only from secondary forests. Furthermore, the selection was also conducted using BLASTn: Align Two or More Sequence analysis to determine the similarity between selected BKS candidates. Based on the detected BKS candidate, a specific primer was designed to amplify the BKS sequence, and the specificity was tested in silico with FastPCR to detect that the primer was only for the amplification of the BKS target. Two BKS candidates with the same sequence length of 455 bp were discovered in the secondary forests and there were successfully amplified by 2 pairs of specific primers. The 16S rRNA gene sequences of the two BKS candidates could be used to monitor the peat quality that has been converted into plantation areas molecularly.},

 abstract = {Basic-leucine zipper transcription factor ATF-like (BATF) and interferon regulatory factor 4 (IRF4) are crucial transcription factors for generation of cytotoxic effector and memory CD8+ T cells. JunB is required for expression of genes controlled by BATF and IRF4 in CD4+ T cell responses, but the role of JunB in CD8+ T cells remains unknown. Here, we demonstrate that JunB is essential for cytotoxic CD8+ T cell responses. JunB expression is transiently induced, depending on T cell receptor (TCR) signal strength. JunB deficiency severely impairs clonal expansion of effector CD8+ T cells in response to acute infection with Listeria monocytogenes. Junb-deficient CD8+ T cells fail to control transcription and chromatin accessibility of a specific set of genes regulated by BATF and IRF4, resulting in impaired cell survival, glycolysis, and cytotoxic CD8+ T cell differentiation. Furthermore, JunB deficiency enhances expression of coinhibitory receptors, including programmed death receptor 1 (PD-1) and T-cell immunoglobulin mucin-3 (TIM3) upon activation of naïve CD8+ T cells. These results indicate that JunB, in collaboration with BATF and IRF4, promotes multiple key events in the early stage of cytotoxic CD8+ T cell responses.},

Between July 2022 and June 2024, 213 human and 191 animal samples, including nasal, pus, and wound swabs, were collected from two veterinary hospitals. Staphylococcus aureus was isolated using selective media and confirmed by Gram staining, biochemical tests, and PCR for the nuc gene. Methicillin resistance was verified by cefoxitin disk diffusion and PCR detection of the mecA gene. Antimicrobial susceptibility was tested against 15 antibiotics, and whole genome sequencing (WGS) identified Staphylococcal Cassette Chromosome mec (SCCmec) types. The prevalence of S. aureus was 31.92\% in humans, 18.18\% in cats, and 32.43\% in dogs, with MRSA detected in 15.02\% of humans, 5.84\% of cats, and 13.51\% of dogs. All MRSA isolates were resistant to cefoxitin, with high resistance to penicillin (94.87\%), azithromycin (82.00\%), and ciprofloxacin (53.85\%) but were sensitive to amikacin, clindamycin, linezolid, and vancomycin. Genetic analysis revealed four sequence types (ST), predominantly ST6 (66.67\%), and clonal relationships between pet-owner MRSA pairs. Virulence profiling showed the presence of hemolysins, Panton-Valentine Leukocidin, and toxic shock syndrome toxin genes in select isolates. Detection of diverse MRSA lineages, including ST88 and ST6-t304, highlights the need for targeted MRSA surveillance and effective infection control. Collaboration between veterinary and human healthcare sectors through a One Health approach is crucial to managing MRSA spread and associated risks.},

 abstract = {This study investigated the prevalence of methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA), their antimicrobial resistance, virulence determinants, and potential zoonotic potential between pets, owners, and veterinary professionals. From July 2022 to June 2024, 213 human and 191 animal samples (nasal, pus, and wound swabs) were collected from two veterinary hospitals. Staphylococcus aureus was isolated using conventional cultural method and subsequently confirmed through Gram staining, biochemical tests, and PCR targeting the nuc gene. Methicillin resistance was confirmed using the cefoxitin disk diffusion method and PCR for the mecA gene. Antimicrobial susceptibility testing was performed using the disc diffusion method against 15 antibiotics. Additionally, whole genome sequencing (WGS) was conducted on selected MRSA isolates from pets and their owners to study clonal transmission and virulence factors. The prevalence of MRSA in humans was 15.0\%, in cats was 5.8\% and in dogs was 13.5\%. The MRSA isolates exhibited resistance to penicillin (94.9\%), azithromycin (82\%), and ciprofloxacin (53.9\%), in addition to their intrinsic resistance to cefoxitin. Multidrug resistance was observed in 94.9\% of MRSA isolates, though all were sensitive to amikacin, clindamycin, linezolid, and vancomycin. Notably, six dogs and cats, along with their respective owners, tested positive for MRSA. WGS analysis of these six pairs (12 isolates) showed four sequence types (ST), with ST6 being the most common (66.7\%). There were also four spa types identified, with t304 being the predominant (58.3\%). Within four pairs, identical ST-spa patterns were observed, except for the pair C52-P52 and D88-P88. Two pairs of isolates, C134-P134 and C185-P185, showed clonality based on whole genome and core genome SNP analysis, and other genetic parameters, suggesting clonal transmission between the pets and their respective owners. Virulence profiling revealed the presence of hemolysins, Panton-Valentine Leukocidin, and toxic shock syndrome toxin genes in selected isolates. The detection of diverse MRSA lineages, including human lineages ST80, ST88 and ST6-t304 in pets, indicates their zoonotic potential, and emphasizes the necessity for targeted MRSA surveillance and effective infection control measures. A collaborative One Health approach is therefore imperative to address the spread of MRSA between pets and their owners, thereby mitigating associated risks.

 abstract = {Cancer cell lines are amongst the most important pre-clinical models. In the context of epithelial ovarian cancer, a highly heterogeneous disease with diverse subtypes, it is paramount to study a wide panel of models in order to draw a representative picture of the disease. As this lethal gynaecological malignancy has seen little improvement in overall survival in the last decade, it is all the more pressing to support future research with robust and diverse study models. Here, we describe ten novel spontaneously immortalized patient-derived ovarian cancer cell lines, detailing their respective mutational profiles and gene/biomarker expression patterns, as well as their in vitro and in vivo growth characteristics. Eight of the cell lines were classified as high-grade serous, while two were determined to be of the rarer mucinous and clear cell subtypes, respectively. Each of the ten cell lines presents a panel of characteristics reflective of diverse clinically relevant phenomena, including chemotherapeutic resistance, metastatic potential, and subtype-associated mutations and gene/protein expression profiles. Importantly, four cell lines formed subcutaneous tumors in mice, a key characteristic for pre-clinical drug testing. Our work thus contributes significantly to the available models for the study of ovarian cancer, supplying additional tools to better understand this complex disease.},

@phdthesis{schafer_algorithms_2024,
 abstract = {RNA-RNA intra- and intermolecular interactions are fundamental for numerous biological processes. While there are reasonable approaches to map RNA secondary structures genome-wide, understanding how different RNAs interact to carry out their regulatory functions requires mapping of intermolecular base pairs. RNA-RNA interaction prediction algorithms alone are not capable to consider all biological factors, thus, they suffer from low accuracy. Recently, different strategies to detect RNA-RNA duplexes in living cells, so called direct duplex detection (DDD) methods, have been developed. Common to all is the psoralen-mediated in vivo RNA crosslinking followed by RNA Proximity Ligation to join the two interacting RNA strands. Sequencing of the RNA via classical RNA-Seq and subsequent specialised bioinformatic analyses, which results in the prediction of intra- and intermolecular RNA-RNA interactions. Existing approaches adapt standard RNA-seq analysis pipelines but often neglect inherent features of RNA-RNA interactions that are useful for filtering and statistical assessment. In this work, RNAnue is presented, a general pipeline for the inference of RNA-RNA interactions from DDD experiments that takes into account hybridisation potential and statistical significance to improve prediction accuracy. RNAnue was applied to data from different DDD studies, and the results were compared to those of the original methods. This showed that RNAnue performs better in terms of prediction quantity and quality.},

 abstract = {Generating complete, high-quality genome assemblies is key for any downstream analysis, such as comparative genomics. For bacterial genome assembly, various algorithms and fully automated pipelines exist, which are free-of-charge and easily accessible. However, these assembly tools often cannot unambiguously resolve a bacterial genome, for example due to the presence of sequence repeat structures on the chromosome or on plasmids. Then, a more sophisticated approach and/or manual curation is needed. Such modifications can be challenging, especially for non-bioinformaticians, because they are generally not considered as a straightforward process. In this study, we propose a standardized approach for manual genome completion focusing on the popular hybrid assembly pipeline Unicycler. The provided Galaxy workflow addresses two weaknesses in Unicycler’s hybrid assemblies: (i) collapse of inter-plasmidic repeats and (ii) false loss of single-copy sequences. To demonstrate and validate how to detect and resolve these assembly errors, we use two genomes from the Bacillus cereus group. By applying the proposed pipeline following an automated assembly, the genome sequence quality can be significantly improved.},

@article{schildhauer_glycation_2023,
 abstract = {Glioblastoma (GBM) is a highly aggressive brain tumor that often utilizes aerobic glycolysis for energy production (Warburg effect), resulting in increased methylglyoxal (MGO) production. MGO, a reactive dicarbonyl compound, causes protein alterations and cellular dysfunction via glycation. In this study, we investigated the effect of glycation on sialylation, a common post-translational modification implicated in cancer. Our experiments using glioma cell lines, human astrocytes (hA), and primary glioma samples revealed different gene expressions of sialyltransferases among cells, highlighting the complexity of the system. Glycation has a differential effect on sialyltransferase expression, upregulating ST8SIA4 in the LN229 and U251 cell lines and decreasing the expression in normal hA. Subsequently, polysialylation increased in the LN229 and U251 cell lines and decreased in hA. This increase in polysialylation could lead to a more aggressive phenotype due to its involvement in cancer hallmark processes such as immune evasion, resistance to apoptosis, and enhancing invasion. Our findings provide insights into the mechanisms underlying GBM aggressiveness and suggest that targeting glycation and sialylation could be a potential therapeutic strategy.},

In this study, \textit{Cx3cr1}-positive MCs were isolated by fluorescence-activated cell sorting from six-week (young) and two-year-old (old) \textit{Cx3cr1$^{\textrm{GFP}}$}$^{\textrm{/+}}$ mice, both during physiological aging and laser-induced CNV development. High-throughput RNA-sequencing was performed to define the age-dependent transcriptional differences in MCs during physiological aging and CNV development, complemented by immunohistochemical characterization and the quantification of MCs, as well as CNV size measurements. These analyses revealed that myeloid cells change their transcriptional profile during both aging and CNV development. In the steady state, senescent MCs demonstrated an upregulation of factors contributing to cell proliferation and chemotaxis, such as \textit{Cxcl13 and Cxcl14}, as well as the downregulation of microglial signature genes. During CNV formation, aged myeloid cells revealed a significant upregulation of angiogenic factors such as \textit{Arg1} and \textit{Lrg1} concomitant with significantly enlarged CNV and an increased accumulation of MCs in aged mice in comparison to young mice. Future studies need to clarify whether this observation is an epiphenomenon or a causal relationship to determine the role of immunosenescence in CNV formation.},

 abstract = {Age-related macular degeneration (AMD) represents the most common cause of blindness in the elderly in the Western world. An impairment of the outer blood-retina barrier and a localized inflammatory microenvironment cause sprouting of choroidal neovascular membranes (CNV) in neovascular AMD that are in intimate contact with surrounding myeloid cells, such as retinal microglia, and ultimately lead to visual impairment. The discovery of novel target molecules to interfere with angiogenesis and inflammation is vital for future treatment approaches in AMD patients. To explore the transcriptional profile and the function of retinal microglia at sites of CNV, we performed a comprehensive RNA-seq analysis of retinal microglia in the mouse model of laser-induced choroidal neovascularization (mCNV). Here, we identified the angiogenic factor Osteopontin (\textit{Opn}), also known as "secreted phosphoprotein 1" (\textit{Spp1}), as one of the most highly expressed genes in retinal microglia in the course of CNV formation. We confirmed the presence of SPP1 at the lesion site in recruited retinal microglia in \textit{Cx3cr1} $^{\textrm{CreER}}$:\textit{Rosa26-tdTomato} reporter mice by confocal microscopy and in whole retinal tissue lysates by ELISA highlighting a massive local production of SPP1. Inhibition of SPP1 by intravitreal injection of an anti-SPP1 antibody significantly increased the lesion size compared to IgG-treated control eyes. In line with our results in rodents, we found an increased \textit{SPP1} mRNA expression in surgically extracted human choroidal neovascular (hCNV) membranes by the quantitative RNA-seq approach of massive analysis of cDNA ends (MACE). Numerous IBA1$^{\textrm{+}}$SPP1$^{\textrm{+}}$ myeloid cells were detected in human CNV membranes. Taken together, these results highlight the importance of SPP1 in the formation of CNV and potentially offer new opportunities for therapeutic intervention by modulating the SPP1 pathway.},

However, the contribution of MG and MAC to the myeloid cell pool at RAP sites and their exact functions remain unknown. In this study, we combined a microglia-specific reporter mouse line with a mouse model for RAP to identify the contribution of MG and MAC to myeloid cell accumulation at RAP and determined the transcriptional profile of MG using RNA sequencing. We found that MG are the most abundant myeloid cell population around RAP, whereas MAC are rarely, if ever, associated with late stages of RAP. RNA sequencing of RAP-associated MG showed that differentially expressed genes mainly contribute to immune-associated processes, including chemotaxis and migration in early RAP and proliferative capacity in late RAP, which was confirmed by immunohistochemistry. Interestingly, MG upregulated only a few angiomodulatory factors, suggesting a rather low angiogenic potential. In summary, we showed that MG are the dominant myeloid cell population at RAP sites. Moreover, MG significantly altered their transcriptional profile during RAP formation, activating immune-associated processes and exhibiting enhanced proliferation, however, without showing substantial upregulation of angiomodulatory factors.},

 abstract = {Recent studies have deciphered the transcriptional profile of choroidal neovascularisation (CNV) in body donor eyes with neovascular age-related macular degeneration (nAMD) and were thus limited by the time span from death to preservation and the associated 5'-RNA degradation. Therefore, this study used CNV and control specimens which had been formalin-fixed and paraffin-embedded immediately after surgical extraction and analyzed them using a 3’ RNA sequencing approach. Transcriptome profiles were analyzed and used to estimate content of immune and stromal cells and to define disease-associated gene signatures using statistical and bioinformatic methods. We identified 158 differentially-expressed genes (DEG) that were significantly increased in CNV compared to control tissue. Cell type enrichment analysis revealed a diverse cellular landscape with an enrichment of immune and stroma cell types in CNV including endothelial cells, macrophages, T cells and NKT cells. Gene ontology enrichment analysis demonstrated that DEG contributed to Blood Vessel Development, Extracellular Structure Organization, Response to Wounding and several immune-related terms. The S100 calcium-binding protein A8 (S100A8) and S100A9 emerged among the top DEG, as confirmed by immunohistochemistry on CNV tissue and protein analysis of vitreous samples. This study provides a high-resolution RNA-sequencing-based transcriptional signature of human CNV, characterizes its compositional pattern of immune and stromal cells and reveals S100A8/A9 as a novel biomarker and promising target for AMD-directed therapeutics and diagnostics.},

Its potential for advancing scientific progress via modern, data-driven discovery approaches reaches beyond disciplinary borders. To fully exploit this potential, it is necessary to make bioimaging data, in general, multidimensional microscopy images and image series, FAIR, that is, findable, accessible, interoperable and reusable. These FAIR principles for research data management are now widely accepted in the scientific community and have been adopted by funding agencies, policymakers and publishers. To remain competitive and at the forefront of research, implementing the FAIR principles into daily routines is an essential but challenging task for researchers and research infrastructures. Imaging core facilities, well-established providers of access to imaging equipment and expertise, are in an excellent position to lead this transformation in bioimaging research data management. They are positioned at the intersection of research groups, IT infrastructure providers, the institution´s administration, and microscope vendors. In the frame of German BioImaging – Society for Microscopy and Image Analysis (GerBI-GMB), cross-institutional working groups and third-party funded projects were initiated in recent years to advance the bioimaging community's capability and capacity for FAIR bioimage data management. Here, we provide an imaging-core-facility-centric perspective outlining the experience and current strategies in Germany to facilitate the practical adoption of the FAIR principles closely aligned with the international bioimaging community. We highlight which tools and services are ready to be implemented and what the future directions for FAIR bioimage data have to offer.},

 abstract = {In acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL), chromosomal translocations involving the KMT2A gene represent highly unfavorable prognostic factors and most commonly occur in patients less than 1 year of age. Rearrangements of the KMT2A gene drive epigenetic changes that lead to aberrant gene expression profiles that strongly favor leukemia development. Apart from this genetic lesion, the mutational landscape of KMT2A-rearranged ALL is remarkably silent, providing limited insights for the development of targeted therapy. Consequently, identifying potential therapeutic targets often relies on differential gene expression, yet the inhibition of these genes has rarely translated into successful therapeutic strategies. Therefore, we performed CRISPR-Cas9 knock-out screens to search for genetic dependencies in KMT2A-rearranged ALL. We utilized small-guide RNA libraries directed against the entire human epigenome and kinome in various KMT2A-rearranged ALL, as well as wild-type KMT2A ALL cell line models. This screening approach led to the discovery of the epigenetic regulators ARID4B and MBD3, as well as the receptor kinase BMPR2 as novel molecular vulnerabilities and attractive therapeutic targets in KMT2A-rearranged ALL.},

 abstract = {PMT is a protein toxin produced by Pasteurella multocida serotypes A and D. As causative agent of atrophic rhinitis in swine, it leads to rapid degradation of the nasal turbinate bone. The toxin acts as a deamidase to modify a crucial glutamine in heterotrimeric G proteins, which results in constitutive activation of the G proteins and permanent stimulation of numerous downstream signaling pathways. Using a lentiviral based genome wide CRISPR knockout screen in combination with a lethal toxin chimera, consisting of full length inactive PMT and the catalytic domain of diphtheria toxin, we identified the LRP1 gene encoding the Low-Density Lipoprotein Receptor-related protein 1 as a critical host factor for PMT function. Loss of LRP1 reduced PMT binding and abolished the cellular response and deamidation of heterotrimeric G proteins, confirming LRP1 to be crucial for PMT uptake. Expression of LRP1 or cluster 4 of LRP1 restored intoxication of the knockout cells. In summary our data demonstrate LRP1 as crucial host entry factor for PMT intoxication by acting as its primary cell surface receptor.},

To gain insights into tumorigenesis and molecular profiles of these tumors, and to ultimately suggest alternative treatment options, we generated a genetically engineered mouse model by breeding hGFAP-cre::Trp53Fl/Fl::lsl-MYCN mice. All mice developed aggressive forebrain tumors early in their lifetime that mimic human HGG-MYCN regarding histology, DNA methylation, and gene expression. Single-cell RNA sequencing revealed a high intratumoral heterogeneity with neuronal and oligodendroglial lineage signatures. High-throughput drug screening using both mouse and human tumor cells finally indicated high efficacy of Doxorubicin, Irinotecan, and Etoposide as possible therapy options that children with HGG-MYCN might benefit from.},

Because of their critical roles, G4s are potential antiviral targets, yet their function remains largely unknown. Here, we characterize the formation and functions of a conserved G4 within the polymerase coding region of orthoflaviviruses of the Flaviviridae family. Using yellow fever virus, we determine that this G4 promotes viral replication and suppresses host stress responses via interactions with hnRNPH1, a host nuclear protein involved in RNA processing. G4 binding to hnRNPH1 causes its cytoplasmic retention with subsequent impacts on G4-containing tRNA fragments (tiRNAs) involved in stress-mediated reductions in translation. As a result, these host stress responses and associated antiviral effects are impaired. These data reveal that the interplay between hnRNPH1 and both host and viral G4 targets controls the integrated stress response and viral replication.},

@phdthesis{schulze_identification_2023,
 abstract = {The ”virosphere” refers to the entire realm of viruses that exist on Earth. It includes all types of viruses, but up until recently, research has been mainly focused on those that directly affect humans and other animal or plant species of economic relevance.Yet, the virosphere is estimated to be incredibly vast, with millions of different viral species, and it is believed that many more viruses are yet to be discovered. The study of the virosphere is crucial for understanding the diversity, evolution, and ecology of viruses and their interactions with their hosts. It is also important for identifying potential threats to human and animal health, such as emerging infectious diseases, and for developing strategies to prevent and control viral infections. One part of the virosphere are arboviruses, or arthropod-borne viruses, a group of viruses that are transmitted by arthropods such as mosquitoes, ticks, and sandflies. Arboviral diseases, including dengue fever, chikungunya, Zika fever, West Nile fever, and yellow fever, have a significant impact on global public health. The emergence and re-emergence of arboviral diseases have become a major concern worldwide due to their increasing incidence and geographic spread. While discovery and description of arboviruses primarily emanated from ’classical’ virological research, the discovery of new virus species, and even whole families, is now often due to the proliferation of advanced sequencing technologies and bioinformatics tools. Another part of the virosphere, that is of some relevance to arboviruses, are insect- or mosquito-specific viruses. These are a group of viruses that have co-evolved with their insect hosts, particularly mosquitoes, and do not infect vertebrates. These viruses have recently received increasing attention due to their potential as a tool for controlling mosquito-borne diseases. Research on insect- or mosquitospecific viruses is essential to understand their biology, evolution, and ecology as well as characterizing their potential to reduce the transmission of mosquito-borne diseases. The presented study is a combined approach, using both sequencing and bioinformatical analysis as well as ’classical’ virological and molecular techniques, to investigate the relationships of mosquito-specific viruses, arboviruses and the mosquito immune-system. Next-generation sequencing techniques were used to identify viral species from field samples. Small RNA sequencing was used to further analyse the interactions of the discovered viruses with the mosquito antiviral RNA interference machinery. Further, experiments were performed to analyse the influence of key effector proteins, Dicer and Argonaute, on the replication of these viruses. Finally, experiments on the interactions of mosquito-specific viruses with arboviruses, focused on viral replication and regulation of the host RNA interference system, were performed. In conclusion, the aggregated data expands our knowledge on the complex virus-virus-host interactions and supplements further approaches in studying mosquito-specific viruses as tools for arbovirus transmission control.},

When we mimicked an early systemic viral infection or applied murine cytomegalovirus (MCMV) systemically in neonatal female and male mice, only male adolescent mice presented behavioral deficits, including reduced social behavior and cognition. This was paralleled by an increased amount of infiltrating T cells in the brain parenchyma, enhanced interferon-γ (IFNγ) signaling, and epigenetic reprogramming of microglial cells. These microglial cells showed increased phagocytic activity, which resulted in abnormal loss of excitatory synapses within the hippocampal brain region. None of these alterations were seen in female adolescent mice. Our findings underscore the early postnatal period’s susceptibility to cause sex-dependent long-term CNS deficiencies following infections.},

Several members such as PRDM1, PRDM14 and PRDM9, have been implicated in germ cell specification and homoeostasis and are essential to fertility-related processes. Others, such as PRDM14, PRDM15 and PRDM10 play a role in early embryogenesis and embryonic stem cell maintenance. Here, we describe the first PRDM family member with a maternal effect. Absence of maternal Prdm10 results in catastrophic failure of oocyte-to-embryo transition and complete arrest at the 2-cell stage. We describe multiple defects in oocytes, zygotes and 2-cell stage embryos relating to the failure to accumulate PRDM10 target gene transcripts in the egg. Transcriptomic analysis and integration of genome-wide chromatin-binding data reveals new and essential PRDM10 targets, including the cytoskeletal protein encoding gene Septin11. We demonstrate that the failure to express maternal Septin11, in the absence of maternal PRDM10, disrupts Septin-complex assembly at the polar body extrusion site in MII oocytes. Our study sheds light into the essentiality of maternal PRDM10, the requirement of the maternal Septin-complex and the likely evolutionary conservation of this regulatory axis in human female germ cells.},

 abstract = {Plant hormones and antioxidant system changes occur during plants' exposure to stress conditions. Although the interactions of some plant hormones (abscisic acid, salicylic acid, jasmonic acid, nitric oxide, and ethylene) with the glutathione s-transferase (GST) enzyme, which is one of the antioxidant enzymes, have already been reported, the influence of gibberellic acid (GA3) on this enzyme under saline conditions has not yet been reported. Plant material for the experiments was obtained from M14G144 cultivar of maize (Zea mays L.) plants grown as a soil culture in growth chambers at 22 °C, 65–70\% moisture, 16-h light/8-h dark conditions, and with full strength Hoagland solution for 8 days under controlled growth conditions. Then, the plants were exposed to salt stress (350 mM NaCl and 100, 300, and 500 ppm GA3) simultaneously. In maize leaves, GA3 treatment alleviated the physiological parameters under salt stress. Specifically, the treatments with 100 and 500 ppm of GA3 were able to trigger GST enzyme and isoenzyme activities as well as hydrogen sulfide accumulation and anthocyanin content, although the lowest malondialdehyde, hydrogen peroxide, and superoxide radical content were under the treatment of 300 ppm of GA3. Besides this, GST gene expression levels were found to be upregulated between 1.5 and fourfold higher in all the plants treated with GA3 at different concentrations in proportion to salt stress. These results first indicated that the reason for the changes in GA3-treated plants was the stimulating role of this hormone to maintain GST regulation in maize plants.},

 abstract = {Burkholderia pseudomallei is a highly infectious bacterium responsible for melioidosis, a systemic disease prevalent in Northern Australia and Southeast Asia. Melioidosis is a community-acquired infectious disease caused by B. pseudomallei, which thrives in tropical regions. This study presents the complete genome sequences of 18 B. pseudomallei isolates from clinical and environmental settings in Kelantan, Malaysia. Clinical isolates were characterized based on patient outcomes: recovery (n=6), relapse (n=4), and death due to melioidosis (n=6), with two environmental isolates that were obtained from soil samples. Draft genome sequences of the isolates were generated using Illumina HiSeq sequencing technology. The 18 B. pseudomallei genomes have an average length of 7,823, 977 bp (7,587,408-8,243,305 bp), an average GC content of 67.4\%, with a mean N50 length and contigs of 47,798 bp and 2,882, respectively. RAST identified an average of 9,671 CDS and 64 RNAs per genome. A total of 144 virulence genes were identified across the dataset, including bimA, bipD, bopA, hcp, and vgrG genes. Antimicrobial resistance gene detection revealed a predicted resistance profile involving the blaOXA-59 gene, conferring resistance to beta-lactam antibiotics, present in all 18 genomes. MLST profiles revealed ST54 as the most common sequence type, corresponding to isolates USM003, USM010, USM011, USM013, and USM014. The 18 draft genomes also showed a close phylogenetic relationship with other genomes from Southeast Asia. In summary, the complete genome sequences of 18 B. pseudomallei isolates have been elucidated and provide a valuable resource to investigate the genetic diversity and virulence profiles of B. pseudomallei.},

It might be hypothesized that medicinal and aromatic plants could use the seeds as vectors to vertically transfer beneficial endophytes, providing plants with metabolic pathways that could influence phytochemicals production. Here, we investigated the localization, the structure and the composition of the bacterial endophytic population that resides in \textit{Origanum heracleoticum} L. seeds. Endocellular bacteria, surrounded by a wall, were localized close to the aleurone layer when using light and transmission electron microscopy. From surface-sterilized seeds, cultivable endophytes were isolated and characterized through RAPD analysis and 16S RNA gene sequencing, which revealed the existence of a high degree of biodiversity at the strain level and the predominance of the genus \textit{Pseudomonas}. Most of the isolates grew in the presence of six selected antibiotics and were able to inhibit the growth of clinical and environmental strains that belong to the \textit{Burkholderia cepacia} complex. The endophytes production of antimicrobial compounds could suggest their involvement in plant secondary metabolites production and might pave the way to endophytes exploitation in the pharmaceutical field.},

The inefficacy of traditional antibiotic drugs could be surmounted through the exploitation of natural bioactive compounds of which medicinal plants are a great reservoir. The finding that bacteria living inside plant tissues, (i.e., the endophytic bacterial microbiome) can influence the synthesis of the aforementioned compounds leads to the necessity of unraveling the mechanisms involved in the determination of this symbiotic relationship. Here, we report the genome sequence of four endophytic bacterial strains isolated from the medicinal plant Origanum vulgare L. and able to antagonize the growth of opportunistic pathogens of cystic fibrosis patients. The in silico analysis revealed the presence of gene clusters involved in the production of antimicrobial compounds, such as paeninodin, paenilarvins, polymyxin, and paenicidin A. Endophytes’ adaptation to the plant microenvironment was evaluated through the analysis of the presence of antibiotic resistance genes in the four genomes. The diesel fuel degrading potential was also tested. Strains grew in minimum media supplemented with diesel fuel, but no n-alkanes degradation genes were found in their genomes, suggesting that diesel fuel degradation might occur through other steps involving enzymes catalyzing the oxidation of aromatic compounds.},

 abstract = {Transcription factors of the CYCLING DOF FACTOR (CDF) family activate in potato the SP6A FT tuberization signal in leaves. In modern cultivars, truncated StCDF1.2 alleles override strict SD control by stabilizing the StCDF1 protein, which leads to StCOL1 suppression and impaired activation of the antagonic SP5G paralog. By using DAP-seq and RNA-seq studies, we here show that StCDF1 not only acts as an upstream regulator of the day length pathway but also directly regulates several N assimilation and transport genes. StCDF1 directly represses expression of NITRATE REDUCTASE (NR/NIA), which catalyses the first reduction step in nitrate assimilation, and is encoded by a single potato locus. StCDF1 knock-down lines performed better in N-limiting conditions, and this phenotype correlated with derepressed StNR expression. Also, deletion of the StNR DAP-seq region abolished repression by StCDF1, while it did not affect NLP7-dependent activation of the StNR promoter. We identified multiple nucleotide polymorphisms in the DAP-seq region in potato cultivars with early StCDF1 alleles, suggesting that this genetic variation was selected as compensatory mechanism to the negative impact of StCDF1 stabilization. Thereby, directed modification of the StCDF1-recognition elements emerges as a promising strategy to enhance limiting StNR activity in potato.},

The objective of this study is to analyze how the food dye BBY interacts with serum protein, bovine serum albumin (BSA). This study investigated the BBY-BSA interaction at the molecular level. Fluorescence spectroscopy results showed that the quenching of BSA by BBY is carried out by dynamic quenching mechanism. The displacement assay and molecular docking studies revealed that BBY binds at the flavanone binding site of BSA with hydrophobic interactions. Circular Dichroism results indicate the structural stability of the protein upon BBY binding. Molecular dynamics simulations demonstrated the stability of the complex in a dynamic solvent system, and quantum mechanics calculations showed slight conformational changes of the diaminophenyl ring due to increased hydrophobic interaction. The energetics of gas phase optimized and stable MD structures of BBY indicated similar values which further confirmed that the conformational changes were minor, and it also exhibited a moderate binding with BSA as shown by the MM/PBSA results. This study enhances our understanding of the molecular-level interactions between BBY and BSA, emphasizing the critical role of hydrophobic interactions.},

 abstract = {BackgroundLeishmaniasis is a major public health concern, with a high annual incidence and extensive geographical distribution. This parasitic disease is transmitted through the bite of specific species of sand flies and is caused by flagellated protozoa. Leishmania major is one of the main causes of cutaneous leishmaniasis (CL) in Iran, with diverse clinical manifestations. This research seeks to explore the impact of genetic diversity on clinical differences by investigating variations in chromosomal count and analyzing single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) and insertions/deletions (Indels).Materials and methodsThe whole genome of the Iranian Leishmania major strain MRHO/IR/75/ER has been sequenced using next-generation sequencing. Data alignment to the reference genome, variant calling, and SNP, Indel, and chromosomal variation identification were carried out using bioinformatics tools.ResultsThe findings indicated notable karyotypic variations in the Iranian Leishmania major strain, specifically demonstrating monosomy on chromosome 2 and trisomy on chromosomes 5, 13, 28, and 31. The analysis of SNPs and INDELs revealed 144,509 genetic variants, with 99\% situated within coding regions. Significant changes were observed in MRPA, HSP70.4, GP63, and CPA, which may affect drug resistance and pathogenicity.ConclusionThis research clarifies the genetic diversity of L. major and its consequences for disease development and resistance to treatment. Further functional studies are essential to validate these genetic discoveries and their implications for clinical practice.},

@article{sharma_cytokinesis_2025,
 abstract = {The polarized architecture of neurons is intricately associated with modulation of microtubule dynamics. Over the years several microtubule-associated-factors that modulate neuronal polarity have been identified. However, the precise details of how microtubule arrangement and stability is established in axon and dendrites is not clearly understood. To uncover relevant factors involved in the biological pathways governing microtubule regulation in neuron, we conducted a suppressor screen using the neuronal ectopic extension phenotype caused due to loss of kinesin-13 family microtubule depolymerizing protein KLP-7 in C. elegans . Interestingly, apart from eleven variants of α ( mec-12 ) and β ( mec-7 ) tubulins, we isolated a variant of cytokinesis associated protein, W02B8.2/citk-1, the kinase-less worm orthologue of mammalian citron-rho interacting kinase (CIT). Little is known about the role of CITK in microtubule regulation in post-mitotic neurons. In this study, we found that the kinase-less worm orthologues of CIT, citk-1 and citk-2 redundantly modulate microtubule stability in the axon-like anterior process and maintain the population of plus-end-out microtubules in the dendrite-like posterior process of the PLM mechanosensory neurons in a cell autonomous manner. In the absence of citk-1 , PLM neurons exhibit variable morphological defects including defects in migration, growth, and guidance. Moreover, the neuronal and microtubule phenotypes of loss of both citk-1 and citk-2 were phenocopied by the mutant animals of aspm-1, the worm homolog of abnormal spindle-like microcephaly-associated protein (ASPM), suggesting a genetic association, similar to their association in dividing mammalian cells. These observations suggest that the cytokinesis associated citron kinase and ASPM-1 have non-mitotic roles in C. elegans mechanosensory neurons in the regulation of microtubules.},

 abstract = {Sperm DNA methylation changes have been implicated in the increased adverse pregnancy and offspring disease risks associated with advanced paternal age. Here, an analysis of diverse, publicly available human multi-omic data is presented that assesses the mechanistic plausibility for these changes to exert cross-generational developmental and health effects. First, differentially methylated CpGs in aging sperm DNA were found to specifically overrepresent differentially methylated CpGs in aging and disease soma. Next, sperm and soma common CpGs, compared to sperm and soma unique CpGs, showed higher enrichment for regulatory regions of developmental genes. Further, genes associated with the common CpGs, compared to the unique CpGs, showed higher enrichment for genes differentially expressed during both preimplantation and postimplantation development, and most crucially for epigenetic inheritance amenability, in early embryos known to undergo paternal methylation-associated gene regulation and in epigenetically reprogrammed primordial germ cells. Higher enrichment is likewise also observed for aging- and disease-associated genes. These results suggest that aging sperm methylation marks may possibly affect early embryonic gene expression, with downstream somatic and germline gene regulatory consequences leading to reestablishment of methylation marks, developmental anomalies, and inheritance of disease phenotypes. This data-grounded mechanistic possibility could be relevant in epigenetic inheritance in general.},

Nonetheless, recent studies suggest their significant impact on splicing, RNA stability, RNA folding, translation or co-translational protein folding. Hence, we compile 659194 synonymous mutations found in human cancer and characterize their properties. We provide the user-friendly, comprehensive resource for synonymous mutations in cancer, SynMICdb (http://SynMICdb.dkfz.de), which also contains orthogonal information about gene annotation, recurrence, mutation loads, cancer association, conservation, alternative events, impact on mRNA structure and a SynMICdb score. Notably, synonymous and missense mutations are depleted at the 5'-end of the coding sequence as well as at the ends of internal exons independent of mutational signatures. For patient-derived synonymous mutations in the oncogene KRAS, we indicate that single point mutations can have a relevant impact on expression as well as on mRNA secondary structure., Synonymous mutations do not alter amino acid sequence but may exert oncogenic effects in other ways.

 abstract = {The oomycete Pythium oligandrum is a potential biocontrol agent to control a wide range of fungal and oomycete-caused diseases, such as Pythium myriotylum-caused rhizome rot in ginger, leading to reduced yields and compromised quality. Previously, P. oligandrum has been studied for its plant growth-promoting potential by auxin production and induction of disease resistance by elicitors such as oligandrin. Volatile organic compounds (VOCs) play beneficial roles in sustainable agriculture by enhancing plant growth and resistance. We investigated the contribution of P. oligandrum-produced VOCs on plant growth and disease suppression by initially using Nicotiana benthamiana plants for screening. P. oligandrum VOCs significantly enhanced tobacco seedling and plant biomass contents. Screening of the individual VOCs showed that 3-octanone and hexadecane promoted the growth of tobacco seedlings. The total VOCs from P. oligandrum also enhanced the shoot and root growth of ginger plants. Transcriptomic analysis showed a higher expression of genes related to plant growth hormones and stress responses in the leaves of ginger plants exposed to P. oligandrum VOCs. The concentrations of plant growth hormones such as auxin, zeatin, and gibberellic acid were higher in the leaves of ginger plants exposed to P. oligandrum VOCs. In a ginger disease biocontrol assay, the VOC-exposed ginger plants infected with P. myriotylum had lower levels of disease severity. We conclude that this study contributes to understanding the growth-promoting mechanisms of P. oligandrum on ginger and tobacco, priming of ginger plants against various stresses, and the mechanisms of action of P. oligandrum as a biocontrol agent.
IMPORTANCE Plant growth promotion plays a vital role in enhancing production of agricultural crops, and Pythium oligandrum is known for its plant growth-promoting potential through production of auxins and induction of resistance by elicitors. This study highlights the significance of P. oligandrum-produced VOCs in plant growth promotion and disease resistance. Transcriptomic analyses of leaves of ginger plants exposed to P. oligandrum VOCs revealed the upregulation of genes involved in plant growth hormone signaling and stress responses. Moreover, the concentration of growth hormones significantly increased in P. oligandrum VOC-exposed ginger plants. Additionally, the disease severity was reduced in P. myriotylum-infected ginger plants exposed to P. oligandrum VOCs. In ginger, P. myriotylum-caused rhizome rot disease results in severe losses, and biocontrol has a role as part of an integrated pest management strategy for rhizome rot disease. Overall, growth enhancement and disease reduction in plants exposed to P. oligandrum-produced VOCs contribute to its role as a biocontrol agent.},

 abstract = {The frequency of extreme precipitation events is predicted to increase owing to climate change, leading to soil waterlogging and crop yield losses, particularly in the case of susceptible species, such as barley (Hordeum vulgare). Aerenchyma formation is a key morphological adaptation to waterlogging stress and hypoxic conditions; however, its genetic regulation in barley remains largely unresolved. The aim of this study was to address this knowledge gap and characterize the transcriptional signatures associated with the waterlogging stress response and aerenchyma formation in barley roots.Two barley cultivars (Franklin and Yerong) were subjected to waterlogging stress, followed by analysis of phenotypic traits, including root aerenchyma formation, and transcriptomic profiling of root tissue. Differential gene expression analysis and gene regulatory network construction were carried out using generated RNA-sequencing datasets.Performed analyses identified genes transcriptionally responsive to 24 and 72 h of waterlogging in both cultivars and highlighted metabolic adaptations, regulation of reactive oxygen species signalling and management of stress responses as key elements of the waterlogging response in barley roots. Large intra-individual variation was observed for root aerenchyma formation. This variation was exploited to identify 81 candidate aerenchyma-associated genes and ascertain pathways involved in aerenchyma formation. Furthermore, network analyses suggested that the DNA damage response gene DRT100 and the cell wall-modifying genes XTH16 and XTH15 are regulatory hub genes in aerenchyma formation.This study provides new insights into transcriptional signatures associated with waterlogging responses and aerenchyma formation in barley roots. The identified candidate aerenchyma-associated genes offer new targets for future research and breeding efforts aimed at enhancing waterlogging tolerance in this crop species.},

 abstract = {Background
Ischemia of the bile duct is a common feature in liver disease and transplantation, which represents a major cause of morbidity and mortality, especially after liver transplantation. Detailed knowledge of its pathogenesis remains incomplete due to the lack of appropriate in vitro models.
Methods
To recapitulate biliary damage induced by ischemia and reperfusion in vitro, human intrahepatic cholangiocyte organoids (ICOs) were grown at low oxygen levels of 1\% up to 72 h, followed by re-oxygenation at normal levels.
Findings
ICOs stressed by ischemia and subsequent re-oxygenation represented the dynamic change in biliary cell proliferation, upregulation of epithelial–mesenchymal transition (EMT)-associated markers, and the evocation of phase-dependent cell death programs similar to what is described in patients. Clinical-grade alpha-1 antitrypsin was identified as a potent inhibitor of both ischemia-induced apoptosis and necroptosis.
Interpretation
These findings demonstrate that ICOs recapitulate ischemic cholangiopathy in vitro and enable drug assessment studies for the discovery of new therapeutics for ischemic cholangiopathies.

So, to identify the target the phytochemicals were scrutinized by employing in silico methodologies namely molecular docking, molecular dynamics simulation, and ADMET prediction. Molecular docking revealed that Amentoflavone occupied the active site of the NMDA, and established interactions with Gln110, Glu236, Ile133, and Asp136 with an excellent docking score of −8.535 kcal/mol. Amentoflavone with the best docking score was selected for molecular dynamics which revealed that Amentoflavone maintained stability in the active site of the NMDA receptor with three hydrogen bond interactions in 100 ns time scale of the trajectory. Amentoflavone demonstrated an encouraging ADMET profile as compared to other phytochemicals. In the nut shell Amentoflavone displayed excellent in silico results and further may demonstrate an excellent in vitro NMDA inhibitory potential.},

 abstract = {Fusarium wilt of banana, caused by Fusarium oxysporum f. sp. cubense (Foc), is a serious disease that threatens banana production worldwide. It is a long-standing problem in Hawaii, but previously, there was little knowledge of the causal pathogen. We isolated a strain of Foc, named Foc-UH, from a field experiencing the disease epidemic in Hawaii. Infection assays of a diverse panel of 26 banana clones, including varieties used for differentiating pathogen races and fruit production, revealed that Foc-UH has a race 1 pathogenic phenotype with an intermediate race 2 virulence and revealed the differential resistance of varieties to infection. Separate phylogenetic analyses using the barcoding regions of three nuclear genes, seven complete nuclear genes, and single-nucleotide polymorphisms within conserved whole-genome protein coding sequences placed Foc-UH into recently proposed taxonomic frameworks relevant to Foc and the F. oxysporum species complex. Screening of the 99.7\% complete draft genome identified five secreted in xylem (SIX) gene homologs: SIX1d, SIX1f, SIX9a, SIX9b, and SIX13a. This profile is similar to that of several race 1 isolates except for the absence of SIX4 and SIX6. Foc-UH was morphologically dissimilar to the nearest related isolates. Altogether, this study identified a unique isolate that causes banana Fusarium wilt, which represents the first characterization of the causal pathogen in Hawaii. The findings and genomic resources generated in this study are expected to guide banana breeding and cultivar deployment in Hawaii and beyond and contribute to further understanding of the pathogenicity and evolutionary systematics of Foc.},

@article{showers_scuba_2024,
 abstract = {While robust tools exist for the analysis of single-cell datasets in both Python and R, interoperability is limited, and analysis tools generally only accept one object class. Considerable programming expertise is required to integrate tools across package ecosystems into a comprehensive analysis, due to their differing languages and internal data structures. This complicates validation of results and leads to inconsistent visualizations between analysis suites. Conversion between object formats is the most common solution, but this is difficult and error-prone due to the rapid pace of development of the analysis suites and their underlying data structures. To address this, we created SCUBA (Single-Cell Unified Backend API), an R package that implements a unified data access API for all common R and Python single-cell object formats. SCUBA extends the data access approach from the widely used Seurat package to SingleCellExperiment and anndata objects. SCUBA also implements new data-specific access functions for all supported object types. Performance scales well across all SCUBA-supported formats. In addition to performance, SCUBA offers several advantages over object conversion for the visualization and further analysis of pre-processed single-cell data. First, SCUBA extracts only data required for the operation at hand, leaving the original object unmodified. This process is simpler, less error prone, and less memory intensive than object conversion, which operates on the entire dataset. Second, code written with SCUBA can use any supported object class as input, with simple and consistent syntax across object formats. This allows a single analysis script or package (like our interactive single-cell browser, scExploreR) to work seamlessly with multiple object types, reducing the complexity of the code and improving both readability and reproducibility. Adoption of SCUBA will ultimately improve collaboration and reproducible research in single-cell analysis by lowering the barriers between package ecosystems.},

 abstract = {The single curative measure for heart failure patients is a heart transplantation, which is limited due to a shortage of donors, the need for immunosuppression and economic costs. Therefore, there is an urgent unmet need for identifying cell populations capable of cardiac regeneration that we will be able to trace and monitor. Injury to the adult mammalian cardiac muscle, often leads to a heart attack through the irreversible loss of a large number of cardiomyocytes, due to an idle regenerative capability. Recent reports in zebrafish indicate that Tbx5a is a vital transcription factor for cardiomyocyte regeneration. Preclinical data underscore the cardioprotective role of Tbx5 upon heart failure. Data from our earlier murine developmental studies have identified a prominent unipotent Tbx5-expressing embryonic cardiac precursor cell population able to form cardiomyocytes, in vivo, in vitro and ex vivo. Using a developmental approach to an adult heart injury model and by employing a lineage-tracing mouse model as well as the use of single-cell RNA-seq technology, we identify a Tbx5-expressing ventricular cardiomyocyte-like precursor population, in the injured adult mammalian heart. The transcriptional profile of that precursor cell population is closer to that of neonatal than embryonic cardiomyocyte precursors. Tbx5, a cardinal cardiac development transcription factor, lies in the center of a ventricular adult precursor cell population, which seems to be affected by neurohormonal spatiotemporal cues. The identification of a Tbx5-specific cardiomyocyte precursor-like cell population, which is capable of dedifferentiating and potentially deploying a cardiomyocyte regenerative program, provides a clear target cell population for translationally-relevant heart interventional studies.},

 abstract = {We explored the metabolic integration of Blattella germanica and its obligate endosymbiont Blattabacterium cuenoti by the transcriptomic analysis of the fat body of quasi-aposymbiotic cockroaches, where the endosymbionts were almost entirely removed with rifampicin. Fat bodies from quasi-aposymbiotic insects displayed large differences in gene expression compared to controls. In quasi-aposymbionts, the metabolism of phenylalanine and tyrosine involved in cuticle sclerotization and pigmentation increased drastically to compensate for the deficiency in the biosynthesis of these amino acids by the endosymbionts. On the other hand, the uricolytic pathway and the biosynthesis of uric acid were severely decreased, probably because the reduced population of endosymbionts was unable to metabolize urea to ammonia. Metabolite transporters that could be involved in the endosymbiosis process were identified. Immune system and antimicrobial peptide (AMP) gene expression was also reduced in quasi-aposymbionts, genes encoding peptidoglycan-recognition proteins, which may provide clues for the maintenance of the symbiotic relationship, as well as three AMP genes whose involvement in the symbiotic relationship will require additional analysis. Finally, a search for AMP-like factors that could be involved in controlling the endosymbiont identified two orphan genes encoding proteins smaller than 200 amino acids underexpressed in quasi-aposymbionts, suggesting a role in the host–endosymbiont relationship.},

 abstract = {Compelling evidence supports the potential application of wild crop relatives in Solanum breeding. Efforts have been made to generate genomic data from wild Solanum plants to assess the insertion of advantageous traits into crop species. South America hosts a broad range of plants that have not been widely evaluated at the molecular level. Solanum sessiliflorum is a wild species that shows tolerance to Ralstonia solanacearum and nematode infections. The Illumina platform was used to construct the transcriptome of S. sessiliflorum. The data were analyzed using bioinformatics tools for both phylogenetic comparison and bioprospecting of disease-related genes. Our leaf transcriptome assembly of S. sessiliflorum enables phylogenetic comparisons and stress-tolerant gene bioprospecting. De novo assembly generated 114,184 unigenes. A comparison of the S. sessiliflorum unigene dataset with other Solanum nucleotide genomic resources revealed greater similarity with Solanum tuberosum than with Solanum melongena. Additionally, S. sessiliflorum within the Leptostemonum group, along with S. melongena, possesses features related to Solanum clade evolution. Bioprospection of disease response targets identified 122 potential candidate unigenes retrieved from the S. sessiliflorum dataset. The abundant expression of fragments of disease-related and hormonal defense genes appears to constitute a housekeeping mechanism to avoid pathogen attacks on leaves. In total, 1091 unigenes were classified as transcription factors (TFs), with a large number of TFs associated with biotic resilience. These results highlight the potential for exploring the genomic diversity of S. sessiliflorum, which will be useful for applications in breeding programs.},

Here, we characterise passive and active electrophysiological properties of murine cardiac resident MΦ, and model their potential electrophysiological relevance for CM.We combined classic electrophysiological approaches with 3 D florescence imaging, RNA-sequencing, pharmacological interventions and computer simulations. We used Cx3cr1eYFP/+ mice wherein cardiac MΦ were fluorescently labelled. FACS-purified fluorescent MΦ from mouse hearts were studied by whole-cell patch-clamp. MΦ electrophysiological properties include: membrane resistance 2.2 ± 0.1 GΩ (all data mean±SEM), capacitance 18.3 ± 0.1 pF, resting membrane potential -39.6 ± 0.3 mV, and several voltage-activated, outward or inwardly-rectifying potassium currents. Using ion channel blockers (barium, TEA, 4-AP, margatoxin, XEN-D0103, DIDS), flow cytometry, immuno-staining and RNA-sequencing, we identified Kv1.3, Kv1.5 and Kir2.1 as channels contributing to observed ion currents. MΦ displayed four patterns for outward and two for inward-rectifier potassium currents. Additionally, MΦ showed surface expression of Cx43, a prerequisite for homo- and/or heterotypic electrotonic coupling. Experimental results fed into development of an original computational model to describe cardiac MΦ electrophysiology. Computer simulations to quantitatively assess plausible effects of MΦ on electrotonically coupled CM showed that MΦ can depolarise resting CM, shorten early and prolong late action potential duration, with effects depending on coupling strength and individual MΦ electrophysiological properties, in particular resting membrane potential and presence/absence of Kir2.1.Our results provide a first electrophysiological characterisation of cardiac resident MΦ, and a computational model to quantitatively explore their relevance in the heterocellular heart. Future work will be focussed at distinguishing electrophysiological effects of MΦ–CM coupling on both cell types during steady-state and in patho-physiological remodelling, when immune cells change their phenotype, proliferate, and/or invade from external sources.Cardiac tissue contains resident macrophages (MΦ) which, beyond immunological and housekeeping roles, have been found to electrotonically couple via connexins to cardiomyocytes (CM), stabilising atrio-ventricular conduction at high excitation rates. Here, we characterise structure and electrophysiological function of murine cardiac MΦ and provide a computational model to quantitatively probe the potential relevance of MΦ-CM coupling for cardiac electrophysiology. We find that MΦ are unlikely to have major electrophysiological effects in normal tissue, where they would hasten early and slow late CM-repolarisation. Further work will address potential arrhythmogenicity of MΦ in patho-physiologically remodelled tissue containing elevated MΦ-numbers, incl. non-resident recruited cells.},

How precisely mRNA vaccines train innate immune cells to shape protective host defense mechanisms remains unknown. Here we show that SARS-CoV-2 mRNA vaccination significantly establishes histone H3 lysine 27 acetylation (H3K27ac) at promoters of human monocyte-derived macrophages, suggesting epigenetic memory. However, we found that two consecutive vaccinations were required for the persistence of H3K27ac, which matched with pro-inflammatory innate immune-associated transcriptional changes and antigen-mediated cytokine secretion. H3K27ac at promoter regions were preserved for six months and a single mRNA booster vaccine potently restored their levels and release of macrophage-derived cytokines. Interestingly, we found that H3K27ac at promoters is enriched for G-quadruplex DNA secondary structure-forming sequences in macrophage-derived nucleosome-depleted regions, linking epigenetic memory to nucleic acid structure. Collectively, these findings reveal that mRNA vaccines induce a highly dynamic and persistent training of innate immune cells enabling a sustained pro-inflammatory immune response.},

The binding mechanism and toxicological implications of TMT to human serum albumin (HSA) were examined in this study employing a combination of biophysical and computational methods indicating moderate binding affinity and potential hepato and renal toxicity. Fluorescence quenching experiments showed that TMT binds to HSA with a moderate affinity, and the binding process was spontaneous and predominantly enthalpy-driven. Circular dichroism spectroscopy revealed that TMT binding did not induce any significant conformational changes in HSA, resulting in no changes in its alpha-helix content. The binding site and modalities of TMT interactions with HSA as computed by molecular docking and molecular dynamics simulations revealed that it binds to Sudlow site II of HSA via hydrophobic interactions through its dimethylcyclopropane carboxylate methyl propanyl group. The structural dynamics of TMT induce proper fit into the binding site creating increased and stabilizing interactions. Additionally, molecular mechanics–Poisson Boltzmann surface area calculations also indicated that non-polar and van der Waals were found to be the major contributors to the high binding free energy of the complex. Quantum mechanics (QM) revealed the conformational energies of the binding confirmation and the degree of deviation from the global minimum energy conformation of TMT. The results of this study provide a comprehensive understanding of the binding mechanism of TMT with HSA, which is important for evaluating the toxicity of this insecticide in humans.},

 abstract = {Aminocarb (AMC), a carbamate pesticide, due to its prevalent usage exhibits increased accumulation in the environment affecting both insects and humans. It enters the human body via food grains and be transported through bloodstream. AMC's chemical structure, containing specific molecular frameworks and functional groups, enables it to bind with proteins like albumin and hemoglobin. Given that molecules with similar architecture are known to bind with hemoglobin, we aimed to explore Aminocarb's binding capability and the potential mechanism or mode of its interaction with hemoglobin. Hb being a tetramer with a profound interface between amino acid chains offers multiple binding sites. It is therefore important to investigate the structural aspects of binding of AMC by employing various spectroscopic and in-silico methods. The surface of the α1 chain near the α1β2 interface emerges as the preferred binding site for AMC, primarily due to its conformational restrictions. In its bound state, AMC tends to maintain a relaxed conformation, closely resembling its globally optimized geometry, and resides in close proximity to the α1 chain via multiple hydrophobic contacts and water bridge as observed in molecular dynamics (MD) simulations. Fluorescence quenching experiments showed moderate binding strength (7.7×10⁴ L M⁻1 at 288 K, 7.8×10⁴ L M⁻1 at 298 K, 7.9×10⁴ L M⁻1 at 308 K) and spontaneous binding, driven by hydrophobic and van der Waals interactions, as indicated by enthalpy (0.80 – 0.91 kJ mol⁻1), entropy (0.0970 – 0.0974 kJ mol⁻1), and Gibbs free energy (-27.13 to - 29.08 kJ mol⁻1). Circular dichroism experiments reveal no major structural changes in Hb. Quantum chemical calculations and MD simulations reveal conformation-dependent energy differences, enhancing our understanding of AMC's binding mechanism to Hb.},

Approximately, 10\% of the world population is facing the challenge of food allergy in direct or indirect way. In this study, a genome-wide identification and annotation of the novel putative allergen from Almond is performed. Initially, the whole proteome of Almond (31,000 proteins) was scanned by Allergenonline, a publically available database of already reported allergens from different sources. The detailed analysis suggests that there are 430 putative allergens which reduced to 45 on motif-based screening using AllFam database. These predicted allergens are annotated for their function by using PFAM, GO databases and orthology analysis. To validate our prediction, we have used structural insights of allergen and antibody interactions for one of the predicted putative allergen protein, homologous to Pru ar 3.0101allergen from Apricot. The structure of putative allergen was modeled and molecular docking studies were performed against the antibody. The best docked conformation was subjected to molecular simulation studies to confirm the stable binding of these two molecules. This detailed analysis suggests that the identified allergen will show cross reactivity similar to Pru ar 3.0101 allergen from Apricot. This is one of the first report of identifying and annotating the homologous of Pru ar 3.0101 allergen in Almond.},

 abstract = {Nuclear degradation of aberrant mRNAs in Saccharomyces cerevisiae is accomplished by the nuclear exosome and its cofactors TRAMP/CTEXT. Evidence from this investigation establishes a universal role of the Nrd1p-Nab3p-Sen1p (NNS) complex in the nuclear decay of all categories of aberrant mRNAs. In agreement with this, both nrd1-1 and nrd1-2 mutations impaired the decay of all classes of aberrant messages. This phenotype is similar to that displayed by GAL::RRP41 and rrp6-Δ mutant yeast strains. Remarkably, however, nrd1ΔCID mutation (lacking the C-terminal domain required for interaction of Nrd1p with RNAPII) only diminished the decay of aberrant messages with defects occurring during the early stage of mRNP biogenesis, without affecting other messages with defects generated later in the process. Co-transcriptional recruitment of Nrd1p on the aberrant mRNAs was vital for their concomitant decay. Strikingly, this recruitment on to mRNAs defective in the early phases of biogenesis is solely dependent upon RNAPII. In contrast, Nrd1p recruitment onto export-defective transcripts with defects occurring in the later stage of biogenesis is independent of RNAPII and dependent on the CF1A component, Pcf11p, which explains the observed characteristic phenotype of nrd1ΔCID mutation. Consistently, pcf11-2 mutation displayed a selective impairment in the degradation of only the export-defective messages.},

 abstract = {Background: Transposable elements (TEs) are major components of eukaryotic genomes. The extensive body of evidence suggests that although they were once considered “genomic parasites”, transposons and their transcripts perform specific functions, such as regulation of early embryo development. Understanding the role of TEs in such parasites as trematodes is becoming critically important. Fasciola hepatica, a parasite affecting humans and livestock, undergoes a complex life cycle in diverse environments and hosts, and knowledge about its life cycle regulation is scarce so far. Methods: We summarized the data regarding the repetitive elements in F. hepatica and conducted bulk RNA-seq analysis across its life cycle stages. TE expression profiles were analyzed, focusing on differential expression and potential homology with previously described long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs). Results: Differential expression analysis revealed stage-specific TE transcription patterns, notably peaking during egg and metacercariae stages. Some TEs showed homology with known lncRNAs and contained putative transcription factor binding sites. Interestingly, TE transcription levels were highest in eggs and metacercariae compared to adults, suggesting regulatory roles in trematode life cycle transitions. Conclusions: These findings suggest that TEs may play roles in regulating trematode life cycle transitions. Moreover, TE homology with lncRNAs underscores their significance in gene regulation.},

 abstract = {Lacticaseibacillus paracasei is widely used as a probiotic supplement and food additive in the medicinal and food industries. However, its application requires careful evaluation of safety traits associated with probiotic pathogenesis, including the transfer of antibiotic-resistance genes, the presence of virulence and pathogenicity factors, and the potential disruptions of the gut microbiome and immune system. In this study, we conducted whole genome sequencing (WGS) of L. paracasei FMT2 isolated from fecal microbiota transplantation (FMT) capsules and performed genome annotation to assess its probiotic and safety attributes. Our comparative genomic analysis assessed this novel strain's genetic attributes and functional diversity and unraveled its evolutionary relationships with other L. paracasei strains. The assembly yielded three contigs: one corresponding to the chromosome and two corresponding to plasmids. Genome annotation revealed the presence of 2,838 DNA-coding sequences (CDS), 78 ribosomal RNAs (rRNAs), 60 transfer RNAs (tRNAs), three non-coding RNAs (ncRNAs), and 126 pseudogenes. The strain lacked antibiotic resistance genes and pathogenicity factors. Two intact prophages, one Clustered Regularly Interspaced Short Palindromic Repeats (CRISPR) region, and three antimicrobial peptide gene clusters were identified, highlighting the genomic stability and antimicrobial potential of the strain. Furthermore, genes linked to probiotic functions, such as mucosal colonization, stress resistance, and biofilm formation, were characterized. The pan-genome analysis identified 3,358 orthologous clusters, including 1,775 single-copy clusters, across all L. paracasei strains. Notably, L. paracasei FMT2 contained many unique singleton genes, potentially contributing to its distinctive probiotic properties. Our findings confirm the potential of L. paracasei FMT2 for food and therapeutic applications based on its probiotic profile and safety.},

 abstract = {Travertines, which precipitate from high temperature water saturated with calcium carbonate, are generally considered to be dominated by physico-chemical and microbial precipitates. Here, as an additional influence on organomineral formation, metagenomic data and microscopic analyses clearly demonstrate that highly diverse viral, bacterial and archaeal communities occur in the biofilms associated with several modern classic travertine sites in Europe and Asia, along with virus-like particles. Metagenomic analysis reveals that bacteriophages (bacterial viruses) containing icosahedral capsids and belonging to the Siphoviridae, Myoviridae and Podoviridae families are the most abundant of all viral strains, although the bacteriophage distribution does vary across the sampling sites. Icosahedral shapes of capsids are also the most frequently observed under the microscope, occurring as non-mineralized through to mineralized viruses and virus-like particles. Viruses are initially mineralized by Ca-Si amorphous precipitates with subordinate Mg and Al contents; these then alter to nanospheroids composed of Ca carbonate with minor silicate 80–300 nm in diameter. Understanding the roles of bacteriophages in modern carbonate-saturated settings and related organomineralization processes is critical for their broader inclusion in the geological record and ecosystem models.},

@article{smith_autocrine_2020,
 abstract = {Although accumulation of myeloid-derived suppressor cells (MDSC) is a hallmark of cancer, the underlying mechanism of this accumulation within the tumor microenvironment remains incompletely understood. We report here that TNFα-RIP1-mediated necroptosis regulates accumulation of MDSCs. In tumor-bearing mice, pharmacologic inhibition of DNMT with the DNA methyltransferease inhibitor decitabine (DAC) decreased MDSC accumulation and increased activation of antigen-specific cytotoxic T lymphocytes. DAC-induced decreases in MDSC accumulation correlated with increased expression of the myeloid cell lineage-specific transcription factor IRF8 in MDSCs. However, DAC also suppressed MDSC-like cell accumulation in IRF8-deficient mice, indicating that DNA methylation may regulate MDSC survival through an IRF8-independent mechanism. Instead, DAC decreased MDSC accumulation by increasing cell death via disrupting DNA methylation of RIP1-dependent targets of necroptosis. Genome-wide DNA bisulfite sequencing revealed that the \textit{Tnf} promoter was hypermethylated in tumor-induced MDSCs \textit{in vivo}. DAC treatment dramatically increased TNFα levels in MDSC \textit{in vitro}, and neutralizing TNFα significantly increased MDSC accumulation and tumor growth in tumor-bearing mice \textit{in vivo}. Recombinant TNFα induced MDSC cell death in a dose- and RIP1-dependent manner. IL6 was abundantly expressed in MDSCs in tumor-bearing mice and patients with human colorectal cancer. \textit{In vitro}, IL6 treatment of MDSC-like cells activated STAT3, increased expression of DNMT1 and DNMT3b, and enhanced survival. Overall, our findings reveal that MDSCs establish a STAT3-DNMT epigenetic axis, regulated by autocrine IL6, to silence TNFα expression. This results in decreased TNFα-induced and RIP1-dependent necroptosis to sustain survival and accumulation. SIGNIFICANCE: These findings demonstrate that targeting IL6 expression or function represent potentially effective approaches to suppress MDSC survival and accumulation in the tumor microenvironment.},

 abstract = {During mitosis, chromatin condensation is accompanied by a global arrest of transcription. Recent studies suggest transcriptional reactivation upon mitotic exit occurs in temporally coordinated waves, but the underlying regulatory principles have yet to be elucidated. In particular, the contribution of sequence-specific transcription factors (TFs) remains poorly understood. Here we report that Brn2, an important regulator of neural stem cell identity, associates with condensed chromatin throughout cell division, as assessed by live-cell imaging of proliferating neural stem cells. In contrast, the neuronal fate determinant Ascl1 dissociates from mitotic chromosomes. ChIP-seq analysis reveals that Brn2 mitotic chromosome binding does not result in sequence-specific interactions prior to mitotic exit, relying mostly on electrostatic forces. Nevertheless, surveying active transcription using single-molecule RNA-FISH against immature transcripts reveals differential reactivation kinetics for key targets of Brn2 and Ascl1, with transcription onset detected in early (anaphase) versus late (early G1) phases, respectively. Moreover, by using a mitotic-specific dominant-negative approach, we show that competing with Brn2 binding during mitotic exit reduces the transcription of its target gene \textit{Nestin} Our study shows an important role for differential binding of TFs to mitotic chromosomes, governed by their electrostatic properties, in defining the temporal order of transcriptional reactivation during mitosis-to-G1 transition.},

Coupling MES with the valorization of CO2 from anaerobic digestion and nitrogen from livestock effluents has beneficial environmental effects, reducing greenhouse gas emissions and nitrogen overloading. In addition, the reducing power needed can come from surplus renewable energy. In this study, MES with a biochar-functionalized cathode was tested at varying polarizations, i.e. non polarized, -0.6 V and -1.0 V vs Ag/AgCl, and biogas-derived CO2 and recovered ammonia from pig slurry was supplied. Negative polarization switched the microbial community from heterotrophic, typical of unpolarized MES, to a mix of both heterotrophic and autotrophic/electrotrophic communities at -0.6 V and to mainly autotrophic/electrotrophic at -1.0 V. The more negative polarization allowed the highest CO2 and N capture, i.e. 39 ± 2 \% of the supplied CO2, and 6.7 ± 0.8 \% supplied N. Microbial biomass characterization indicated a protein content on dry matter basis of 33.1 ± 1.3 \% (unpolarized), 43.2 ± 0.6 \% (-0.6 V) and 69.1 ± 1.0 \% (-1.0 V). The amino acids profiles investigated showed a high nutritional value of the produced biomass, not far from those of conventional protein sources used for producing feed/food.},

 abstract = {The emerging heteropathotype shigatoxigenic (STEC) and extra-intestinal pathogenic Escherichia coli (ExPEC) O80:H2 has been the second leading cause of pediatric HUS in France since the mid-2010s. In contrast with other highly pathogenic STEC serotypes, for which ruminants have clearly been identified as the main human infection source, this heteropathotype’s reservoir remains unknown. In this context, we describe for the first time the isolation of seven STEC O80:H2 strains from healthy cattle on a single cattle farm in France. This study aimed at (i) characterizing the genome and (ii) investigating the phylogenetic positions of these O80:H2 STEC strains. The virulomes, resistomes, and phylogenetic positions of the seven bovine isolates were investigated using in silico typing tools, antimicrobial susceptibility testing and cgMLST analysis after short-read whole genome sequencing (WGS). One representative isolate (A13P112V1) was also subjected to long-read sequencing. The seven isolates possessed ExPEC-related virulence genes on a pR444\_A-like mosaic plasmid, previously described in strain RDEx444 and known to confer multi-drug resistance. All isolates were clonally related and clustered with human clinical strains from France and Switzerland with a range of locus differences of only one to five. In conclusion, our findings suggest that healthy cattle in France could potentially act as a reservoir of the STEC-ExPEC O80:H2 pathotype.},

We are pleased to announce our 3rd International Conference on Bioinformatics and Data Science (ICBDS – 2022) and 9th International Conference on Public Mental Health and Neurosciences (ICPMN – 2022) which was a unique conference where we connectted Biological Function through Computational Genomics to the world of integrated medicine and therapeutics. Functional genomics is a field of molecular biology that attempts to describe gene (and protein) functions and interactions. This science aims to understand the complex relationship between genotype and phenotype on a global (genome-wide) scale of different biological processes. Most researchers now study genes or regions on a “genome-wide” scale (i.e. all or multiple genes/regions at the same time), with the hope of narrowing them down to a list of candidate genes or regions to analyze in more detail. There are several specific functional genomics approaches depending on what we are focused on DNA level (genomics and epigenomics), RNA level (transcriptomics), protein level (proteomics), metabolite level (metabolomics) and phenotype level (phenomics). The recent trends in gene and genome editing technologies, promising genomic information can be modulated in the areas of medicine, agriculture and environment. Big data is a promising in many research areas, but still it is computationally challenging and non-availability of experts to handle big-data with reduced speed and cost. With the increasing use of advanced technology and the exploding amount of big-data in, it is imperative to introduce effective and efficient methods to handle big data using computing technologies. The big data analytics technique is required to solve the problems in bioinformatics such as the storage of vast information generated by analyzing the big-data. Big data analytics can examine large data sets, analyze and correlate genomic and proteomic information. Big data research finds a huge application in Neuroscience and Brain research. Our unique conference connects genomics to the world of genomics to integrated medicine including yogic sciences.},

Hence, in this study, potential long non-coding RNAs that regulate flowering /bolting were investigated in two lettuce strains S24 (resistant strain) and S39 (susceptible strain) in different flowering times to better understand the regulation of lettuce bolting mechanism.

The diagnosis rate is, however, still not 100\%. This paper reports the use of a personalized multi-omics (metabolomic, genomic and transcriptomic) pipeline plus functional genomics to aid in the genetic diagnosis of six unsolved cases, with a clinical and/or biochemical diagnosis of galactosemia, mucopolysaccharidosis type I (MPS I), maple syrup urine disease (MSUD), hyperphenylalaninemia (HPA), citrullinemia, or urea cycle deficiency. Eight novel variants in six genes were identified: six (four of them deep intronic) located in GALE, IDUA, PTS, ASS1 and OTC, all affecting the splicing process, and two located in the promoters of IDUA and PTS, thus affecting these genes’ expression. All the new variants were subjected to functional analysis to verify their pathogenic effects. This work underscores how the combination of different omics technologies and functional analysis can solve elusive cases in clinical practice.},

 abstract = {Satellite DNAs (satDNAs) play a crucial role in understanding chromosomal evolution and the differentiation of sex chromosomes across diverse taxa, particularly when high karyotypic diversity occurs. The Physalaemus cuvieri–Physalaemus ephippifer species complex comprises at least seven divergent lineages, each exhibiting specific karyotypic signatures. The group composed of Ph. ephippifer, Lineage 1B of ‘Ph. cuvieri’ (L1B), and a lineage resulting from their secondary contact is especially intriguing due to varying degrees of sex chromosome heteromorphism. In this study, we characterized the satellitome of Ph. ephippifer in order to identify novel satDNAs that may provide insights into chromosomal evolution, particularly concerning sex chromosomes. We identified 62 satDNAs in Ph. ephippifer, collectively accounting for approximately 10\% of the genome. Notably, nine satDNA families were shared with species from distantly related clades, raising questions about their potential roles in anurans genomes. Among the seven satDNAs mapped via fluorescent in situ hybridization, PepSat3 emerged as a strong candidate for the centromeric sequence in this group. Additionally, PepSat11 and PepSat24 provided evidence supporting a translocation involving both arms of the W chromosome in Ph. ephippifer. Furthermore, a syntenic block composed of PepSat3, PcP190, and PepSat11 suggested an inversion event during the divergence of Ph. ephippifer and L1B. The variation in signal patterns of satDNAs associated with nucleolar organizer regions (NORs) highlights the complexity of NOR evolution in this species complex, which exhibits substantial diversity in this genomic region. Additionally, our findings for PepSat30-350 emphasize the importance of validating the sex-biased abundance of satDNAs.},

 abstract = {The last few decades have seen a massive use of antibiotics worldwide, in all from human health care and veterinary use to agriculture and aquaculture. This has led to a rise in emergence of antibiotic resistant bacteria (ARB), where bacteria harbouring genes for extended-spectrum β-lactamases (ESBL) and carbapenem resistance are of particular concern. Infectious diseases caused by these bacteria can be very challenging to treat, and a staggering number of deaths every year result directly or indirectly from antibiotic resistance. With no measurements taken to stop the ARB spread, this problem will only keep on growing. 

This study aimed to investigate the existence of ARBs in six different water habitats from the southwestern and southeastern part of Norway. By the help of ESBL and CRE agar screening plates, ARB were isolated from all water sites. The DNA from a total of 20 bacterial isolate was extracted, and identified through Sanger sequencing. Multiplex and singleplex PCR were performed, using primer pairs of known ESBLs and carbapenemases, to identify the presence of these genes. Antibiotic susceptibility tests were performed on 13 of the isolates, out of which three were chosen for whole genome sequencing.

Eight different bacterial genera were identified, namely Caulobacter, Chonella, Chromobacterium, Herbaspirillum, Novosphingobium, Pseudomonas, Serratia, and Stenotrophomonas. The WGS results revealed two certain, and three putative β-lactamase genes present in the three bacteria that were sequenced. These were a class A β-lactamase gene in Caulobacter, blaFONA-8 and blaSFDC in Serratia, and blaL1 and blaL2 in Stenotrophomonas. This revealed that β-lactam resistant bacteria can be found in various water habitats in the southern part of Norway.},

 abstract = {Amidst the current biodiversity crisis, the availability of genomic resources for declining species can provide important insights into the factors driving population decline. In the early 1990s, the black-legged kittiwake (Rissa tridactyla), a pelagic gull widely distributed across the arctic, subarctic, and temperate zones, suffered a steep population decline following an abrupt warming of sea surface temperature across its distribution range and is currently listed as Vulnerable by the International Union for the Conservation of Nature. Kittiwakes have long been the focus for field studies of physiology, ecology, and ecotoxicology and are primary indicators of fluctuating ecological conditions in arctic and subarctic marine ecosystems. We present a high-quality chromosome-level reference genome and annotation for the black-legged kittiwake using a combination of Pacific Biosciences HiFi sequencing, Bionano optical maps, Hi-C reads, and RNA-Seq data. The final assembly spans 1.35 Gb across 32 chromosomes, with a scaffold N50 of 88.21 Mb and a BUSCO completeness of 97.4\%. This genome assembly substantially improves the quality of a previous draft genome, showing an approximately 5× increase in contiguity and a more complete annotation. Using this new chromosome-level reference genome and three more chromosome-level assemblies of Charadriiformes, we uncover several lineage-specific chromosome fusions and fissions, but find no shared rearrangements, suggesting that interchromosomal rearrangements have been commonplace throughout the diversification of Charadriiformes. This new high-quality genome assembly will enable population genomic, transcriptomic, and phenotype–genotype association studies in a widely studied sentinel species, which may provide important insights into the impacts of global change on marine systems.},

 abstract = {Quaternary climatic fluctuations had a substantial influence on ecosystems, species distribution, phenology and genetic diversity, driving extinction, adaptation and demographic shifts during glacial periods and postglacial expansions. Integration of genomic data and environmental niche modelling can provide valuable insights on how organisms responded to past environmental variations and contribute to assessing vulnerability and resilience to ongoing climatic challenges. Among vertebrates, turtles are particularly vulnerable to habitat changes because of distinctive life history traits and the effect of environmental conditions on physiology and survival. We estimated contemporary heterozygosity (H) and effective population size (Ne) using a high-quality chromosome-level reference genome we produced for the European pond turtle (Emys orbicularis) and reference genomes and whole genome sequence data available for 21 species of tortoises and freshwater turtles. We implemented environmental niche modelling (ENM) to estimate past habitat dynamics. We found recurrent cycles of population expansion and contraction over the last 10 Mya in all species, with a general pattern of decrease in Ne correlated with temperature reduction after the last interglacial period. No correlation was found between habitat fluctuations during the Quaternary and past Ne. Moreover, neither H nor mean Ne was correlated to threat status as defined by IUCN Red List categories. Our results add to studies on other vertebrates showing the extent to which genetic parameters can aid the assessment of conservation status, and although genomic data may not always be consistent indicators of the level of threat, investigations of which genomic parameters could best represent essential biodiversity variables should be consistently supported.},

 abstract = {Globe artichoke ecotypes sanitized from plant pathogen infections are characterized by high vegetative vigor, productivity, and quality of capitula. The recent availability on the market of these plants has renewed the interest of farmers and pharmaceutical industries in the crop. Globe artichoke exhibits interesting nutraceutical properties due to the high content of health-promoting bioactive compounds (BACs), such as polyphenols, that could be extracted from waste biomass. The production of BACs depends on several factors including the plant portion considered, the globe artichoke variety/ecotype, and the physiological status of the plants, linked to biotic and abiotic stresses. We investigated the influence of viral infections on polyphenol accumulation in two Apulian late-flowering ecotypes “Locale di Mola tardivo” and “Troianella”, comparing sanitized virus-free material (S) vs. naturally virus-infected (non-sanitized, NS) plants. Transcriptome analysis of the two ecotypes highlighted that differentially expressed genes (DEGs), in the two tested conditions, were mainly involved in primary metabolism and processing of genetic/environmental information. The up-regulation of the genes related to the biosynthesis of secondary metabolites and the analysis of peroxidase activity suggested that their modulation is influenced by the phytosanitary status of the plant and is ecotype-dependent. Conversely, the phytochemical analysis showed a remarkable decrease in polyphenols and lignin accumulation in S artichokes compared to NS plants. This unique study analyzes the potential of growing vigorous, sanitized plants, in order to have high amounts of ‘soft and clean’ biomass, finalized for BAC extraction for nutraceutical purposes. This, in turn, opens new perspectives for a circular economy of sanitized artichokes, in line with the current phytosanitary standards and sustainable development goals.},

 abstract = {Plant tissue in vitro culture is increasingly used in agriculture to improve crop production, nutritional quality, and commercial value. In plant virology, the technique is used as sanitation protocol to produce virus-free plants. Sanitized (S) artichokes show increased vigour compared to their non-sanitized (NS) counterparts, because viral infections lead to a decline of growth and development. To investigate mechanisms that control the complex traits related to morphology, growth, and yield in S artichokes compared to NS plants, RNAseq analysis and phenotyping by imaging were used. The role of peroxidases (POD) was also investigated to understand their involvement in sanitized plant development. Results showed that virus infection affected regulation of cell cycle, gene expression and signal transduction modulating cellular response to stimulus/stress. Moreover, primary metabolism and photosynthesis were also influenced, contributing to explain the main morphological differences observed between S and NS artichokes. Sanitized artichokes are also characterized by higher POD activity, probably associated with increased plant growth, rather than strengthening of cell walls. Overall, results show that the differences in development of S artichokes may be derived from the in vitro culture stressor, as well as through pathogen elimination, which, in turn, improve qualitative and quantitative artichoke production.},

 abstract = {Globe artichoke (Cynara cardunculus L. subsp. scolymus) is an important crop of the Mediterranean basin characterized by many properties, like hepatoprotective, anticarcinogenic, antioxidant, antibacterial, and beneficial to human health. The high bioactive compounds (BACs) content, as polyphenols, has attracted the research interest in artichoke extracts. We analysed the changes in polyphenol transcriptome profile between sanitized (S) virus-free and non-sanitized (NS) artichoke plants, focusing on genes involved in phenylpropanoid metabolic pathway and flavonoid biosynthesis. A total of 2458 upregulated and 2154 downregulated differentially expressed genes (DEGs) were functionally characterized. Among them, 31 and 35 KEGG orthology entries characterized by upregulated and downregulated DEGs, respectively, were involved in the biosynthesis of other secondary metabolites. A downregulation of PAL, C4H, 4CL, HST/HQT, C3′H, CCoAMT, CCR1, and F5H, was observed in S artichoke compared to NS one, whereas the CSE, CHS, and CHI genes were upregulated in S samples. Transcriptome results were compared to the polyphenols accumulation in S and NS artichoke leaves. A higher content of total polyphenols was observed in older leaves of NS samples, compared to extracts obtained from young leaves or from S plants, and this result was associated with the presence of viral infections in NS plants. In all the conditions tested, the most represented compound was chlorogenic acid, followed by luteolin-7-O-glucoside. The different composition of each extract was evaluated by a polyphenol dose–response treatment on the rodent hepatoma FaO cell line to the accumulation of reactive oxygen species (ROS). A significant reduction in ROS content ranging between −40\% and −48\% was observed when 10–20 mg/L of polyphenols from NS or S plants were used, characterized by a specific profile of compounds. To reduce MetOH residues in polyphenol extracts, a supercritical fluid CO2 extraction was evaluated to propose a sustainable green extraction.},

We characterized the mitochondrial genome of Geomydoecus aurei, a chewing louse (Phthiraptera: Trichodectidae) found on pocket gophers (Rodentia: Geomyidae) using reads from both Illumina and Oxford Nanopore sequencing coupled with PCR, cloning, and Sanger sequencing to verify structure and arrangement for each chromosome. The genome consisted of 12 circular mitochondrial chromosomes ranging in size from 1,318 to 2,088 nucleotides (nt). Total genome size was 19,015 nt. All 37 genes typical of metazoans (2 rRNA genes, 22 tRNA genes, and 13 protein-coding genes) were present. An average of 26\% of each chromosome was composed of non-gene sequences. Within the non-gene region of each chromosome, there was a 79-nt nucleotide sequence that was identical among chromosomes and a conserved sequence with secondary structure that was always followed by a poly-T region. We hypothesize that these regions may be important in the initiation of transcription and DNA replication, respectively. The G. aurei genome shares 8 derived gene clusters with other chewing lice of mammals, but in G. aurei, genes on several chromosomes are not contiguous.},

 abstract = {This work monitored the effect of a municipal and a village wastewater treatment plant (WWTP) technology on the fate of beta-lactam resistance genes in bacterial populations in different phases of the wastewater treatment process. In case of the municipal WWTP1, the bacteria possessing a high ampicillin resistance (minimal inhibitory concentration (MIC) values of 20 mg/mL) accumulated in the sedimentation tank, which was accompanied with a higher concentration of ampicillin in the wastewater samples (28.09 ng/L) and an increase in the relative abundance of the blaTEM gene in the bacterial population. However, an opposite trend was revealed with the blaNDM-1 gene, making the sedimentation processes of WWTP1 crucial only for the accumulation of the blaTEM gene. Similarly, the comparison with the WWTP2 showed that the accumulation of the ampicillin resistance in bacterial population probably depended on the WWTP technology and wastewater composition. Out of the four tested resistance genes (blaTEM, blaKPC, blaNDM-1, and blaOXA-48), blaTEM and blaNDM-1 genes were the only two detected in this study. According to NGS analysis of bacterial 16 S rRNA gene, Gammaproteobacteria dominated the ampicillin-resistant bacteria of the WWTP sedimentation tanks. Their relative abundance in the bacterial population also increased during the sedimentation processes in WWTP1. It could indicate the role of the bacterial taxon in ampicillin resistance accumulation in this WWTP and show that only 9.29\% of the original bacterial population from the nitrification tank is involved in the documented shifts in beta-lactam resistance of the bacterial population.},

@article{staehle_lysine-specific_2025,
 abstract = {The lysine-specific demethylase 1 (LSD1) regulates hematopoietic stem cell differentiation and has been identified as a therapeutic target in hematological disorders. LSD1 demethylates mono and dimethylated histones 3 at lysine 4 and 9. In addition, it acts as a scaffold for the formation of chromatin-modifying complexes that regulates the transcription of myeloid-lineage-specific genes in complex with GFI1, a transcriptional repressor. While both enzymatic and non-enzymatic functions of LSD1 have been well defined, the relative importance of these two functions in hematopoiesis remains incompletely understood. Here, we investigated the contribution of enzymatic and non-enzymatic functions of LSD1 to myelopoiesis. We show that myeloid differentiation is independent of the enzymatic functions of LSD1 but requires the non-enzymatic, scaffolding function, which directs GFI1 binding to target sequences. In the absence of the LSD1 protein, GFI1 DNA binding is diminished, and myeloid cell differentiation arrests at an immature, myelomonocytic-like cell stage, which overexpresses Prtn3. We provide functional data implicating Prtn3 as an effector of the stem cell expansion and myeloid maturation block caused by the loss of LSD1.},

@article{stafiniak_stabilizing_2025,
 abstract = {Accurate normalization is crucial for reliable gene expression quantification and depends on stably expressed housekeeping genes (HKGs) as internal controls. However, HKGs expression varies with developmental stage, tissue type, and treatments, potentially introducing bias and compromising data accuracy. Thus, validating candidate reference genes under defined conditions is essential. Reynoutria, also known as giant Asian knotweeds, is a Polygonaceae family genus of several medicinal plants producing a diverse array of specialized metabolites of pharmacological interest. Outside their native range, these plants are also noxious invasive weeds, causing significant environmental and economic threats. Research on stable reference genes in these species is limited, with a primary focus on R. japonica. To enable accurate gene expression analysis related to specialized metabolism and natural product biosynthesis, we aimed to identify the most stable reference genes across the most common species: R. japonica Houtt., R. sachalinensis (F. Schmidt) Nakai, and their hybrid—R. × bohemica Chrtek \& Chrtková. In this study, we evaluated twelve candidate HKGs (ACT, TUA, TUB, GAPDH, EF-1γ, UBQ, UBC, 60SrRNA, eIF6A, SKD1, YLS8, and NDUFA13) across three tissue types (rhizomes, leaves, and flowers) from three Reynoutria species sampled at peak flowering. Primer specificity and amplification efficiency were confirmed through standard-curve analysis. We assessed expression stability using ΔCt, geNorm, NormFinder, and BestKeeper, and generated comprehensive rankings with RefFinder. Our integrated analysis revealed organ- and species-dependent stability differences, yet identified up to three reference genes suitable for interspecific normalization in Reynoutria. This represents the first systematic, comparative validation of HKGs across closely related knotweed species, providing a robust foundation for future transcriptomic and functional studies of their specialized metabolism and other biological processes.},

During peripheral nerve aging there are cellular and molecular changes, such as increased extracellular matrix deposition. The mechanisms behind these aging-induced alterations remain unclear. Here, we profile mouse sciatic nerves using single nucleus transcriptomics and unravel changes in macrophage subtypes during nerve aging. Phagocytic macrophage numbers increase at the onset of aging, followed by higher numbers of chronic inflammatory macrophages. Based on ligand-receptor analysis, we predict that increased fibroblast growth factor (FGF) signaling from adipocytes activates a chondrocyte-like neural fibroblast state during peripheral nerve aging. Finally, we show that FGF2 induces the co-expression of the chondrocyte markers SOX9 and FOXC2 in senescent human perineurial fibroblast, that can be blocked with FGF1. In conclusion, our findings reveal some of the molecular mechanisms of peripheral nerve aging by FGF-regulated induction of a chondrocyte-like fibroblast state.},

While the widespread occurrence of resistance of Xcc against bactericidal agrochemicals can contribute to the high disease burdens, the role of virulence and pathogenicity features of local strains on disease prevalence and severity has not been investigated yet. In the present study, a comparative genomic analysis was performed on 6 pathogenic Xcc and 4 co-isolated non-pathogenic \textit{Xanthomonas melonis} (Xmel) strains from diseased crucifer plants grown in fields with heavy chemical use in Trinidad. Native isolates were grouped into two known and four newly assigned ribosomal sequence types (rST). Mobile genetic elements were identified which belonged to the IS3, IS5 family, Tn3 transposon, resolvases, and \textit{tra} T4SS gene clusters. Additionally, exogenous plasmid derived sequences with origins from other bacterial species were characterised. Although several instances of genomic rearrangements were observed, native Xcc and Xmel isolates shared a significant level of structural homology with reference genomes, Xcc ATCC 33913 and Xmel CFBP4644, respectively. Complete T1SS \textit{hlyDB}, T2SS, T4SS \textit{vir} and T5SS \textit{xadA}, \textit{yapH} and \textit{estA} gene clusters were identified in both species. Only Xmel strains contained a complete T6SS but no T3SS. Both species contained a complex repertoire of extracellular cell wall degrading enzymes. Native Xcc strains contained 37 T3SS and effector genes but a variable and unique profile of 8 \textit{avr}, 4 \textit{xop} and 1 \textit{hpa} genes. Interestingly, Xmel strains contained several T3SS effectors with low similarity to references including \textit{avrXccA1} ({\textasciitilde}89\%), \textit{hrpG} ({\textasciitilde}73\%), \textit{hrpX} ({\textasciitilde}90\%) and \textit{xopAZ} ({\textasciitilde}87\%). Furthermore, only Xmel genomes contained a CRISPR-Cas I-F array, but no lipopolysaccharide \textit{wxc} gene cluster. Xmel strains were confirmed to be non-pathogenic by pathogenicity assays. The results of this study will be useful to guide future research into virulence mechanisms, agrochemical resistance, pathogenomics and the potential role of the co-isolated non-pathogenic \textit{Xanthomonas} strains on Xcc infections.},

@article{sterling_revision_2025,
 abstract = {The genus Topiris Walker, 1863 is revised. This genus, previously neglected or deemed unrecognisable, comprised only Walker’s damaged and misrepaired type specimen of Topiris candidella Walker, 1863. Evidence is provided that this specimen was collected by Alfred Russel Wallace in 1855–56 in Sarawak, Malaysian Borneo. The mitogenome of this specimen was assembled using low coverage whole genome sequencing (genome skimming). The COI-5P portion of this mitogenome (658 bp) differs by 1–3 bp from two haplotypes sequenced from early 1990’s Brunei specimens. Another specimen recently discovered at NHMUK with an identical label to that of the type perfectly matches the Brunei specimens in its genitalia. Based on these four specimens, we present a fuller description of the morphology of T. candidella. Topiris includes the following additional species authored by Sterling and Lees: Topiris albidella sp. nov., T. albogrisella sp. nov., T. cinderella sp. nov., T. digiticosta sp. nov., T. lacteella sp. nov., T. madonna sp. nov., T. meyricki sp. nov., T. ochrotincta sp. nov., T. schneeweissella sp. nov., T. sericella sp. nov., and T. thunbergella sp. nov. The following new combinations are also established: T. salva (Meyrick, 1932), comb. nov. and T. sampitella (Lvovsky, 2014), comb. nov. The type of Athrypsiastis salva Meyrick is confirmed as lost and so a neotype and paraneotype of this species are designated. A published mitogenome of “Linoclostis gonatias” is shown to be correctly identified as T. salva, and references to L. gonatias, identified in some literature as a pest of Theaceae, are likely misidentified. The genus Topiris is divided into three groups, the candidella group, the salva group, and the albidella group, based on characters in the male genitalia. The candidella group and albidella group are supported sub-clades of Topiris. The phylogenetic placement of Topiris and Athrypsiastis within ‘core’ Xyloryctidae (as subtended by its type species, X. luteotactella) is confirmed by analysis of COI and seven nuclear genes, whereas the genera Eumenodora Meyrick, 1906 and Izatha Walker, 1864 do not fall within this clade. The morphology of Athrypsiastis phaeoleuca Meyrick, 1910 (the type species of Athrypsiastis; Xyloryctidae) is more fully described. The following new species authored by Sterling and Lees are described: Athrypsiastis cheesmanae sp. nov., A. edelweissella sp. nov., and A. penumbrella sp. nov. Two taxa are newly combined: Athrypsiastis halmaherella (Lvovsky, 2014), comb. nov. and Paralecta rosiflora (Meyrick, 1930), comb. nov.},

@article{stillger_neoadjuvant_2024,
 abstract = {Pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) is a highly lethal cancer, often diagnosed at stages that dis-qualify for surgical resection. Neoadjuvant therapies offer potential tumor regression and improved resectability. Although features of the tumor biology (e.g., molecular markers) may guide adjuvant therapy, biological alterations after neoadjuvant therapy remain largely unexplored. We performed mass spectrometry to characterize the proteomes of 67 PDAC resection specimens of patients who received either neoadjuvant chemo (NCT) or chemo-radiation (NCRT) therapy. We employed data-independent acquisition (DIA), yielding a proteome coverage in excess of 3500 proteins. Moreover, we successfully integrated two publicly available proteome datasets of treatment-naïve PDAC to unravel proteome alterations in response to neoadjuvant therapy, highlighting the feasibility of this approach. We found highly distinguishable proteome profiles. Treatment-naïve PDAC was characterized by enrichment of immunoglobulins, complement and extracellular matrix (ECM) proteins. Post-NCT and post-NCRT PDAC presented high abundance of ribosomal and metabolic proteins as compared to treatment-naïve PDAC. Further analyses on patient survival and protein expression identified treatment-specific prognostic candidates. We present the first proteomic characterization of the residual PDAC mass after NCT and NCRT, and potential protein candidate markers associated with overall survival. We conclude that residual PDAC exhibits fundamentally different proteome profiles as compared to treatment-naïve PDAC, influenced by the type of neoadjuvant treatment. These findings may impact adjuvant or targeted therapy options.},

@article{stojkovic_targeted_2024,
 abstract = {Detrimental molecular processes in multiple sclerosis (MS) lead to the cellular accumulation of lipid peroxidation products and iron in the CNS, which represents the main driving force for ferroptosis. Ferroptosis is an iron-dependent form of regulated cell death, with proposed roles in neurodegeneration, oligodendrocyte loss and neuroinflammation in the pathogenesis of MS. Ferroptosis-related gene expression signature and molecular markers, which could reflect MS severity and progression, are currently understudied in humans. To tackle these challenges, we have applied a curated approach to create and experimentally analyze a comprehensive panel of ferroptosis-related genes covering a wide range of biological processes associated with ferroptosis. We performed the first ferroptosis-related targeted RNAseq on PBMCs from highly distinctive MS phenotype groups: mild relapsing–remitting (RR) (n = 24) and severe secondary progressive (SP) (n = 24), along with protein detection of GPX4 and products of lipid peroxidation (MDA and 4-HNE). Out of 138 genes, 26 were differentially expressed genes (DEGs), indicating changes in both pro- and anti-ferroptotic genes, representing a molecular signature associated with MS severity. The top three DEGs, as non-core ferroptosis genes, CDKN1A, MAP1B and EGLN2, were replicated by qPCR to validate findings in independent patient groups (16 RR and 16 SP MS). Co-expression and interactions of DEGs were presented as additional valuable assets for deeper understanding of molecular mechanisms and key targets related to MS severity. Our study integrates a wide genetic signature and biochemical markers related to ferroptosis in easily obtainable PBMCs of MS patients with clinical data and disease severity, thus providing novel molecular markers which can complement disease-related changes in the brain and undergo further research as potential therapeutic targets.},

@article{stoof_mechanisms_2025,
 abstract = {Pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) is a highly fatal disease with limited treatment options. PARP inhibitors (PARPi) have shown promise in treating PDAC with homologous recombination deficiency (HRD), but rapid acquisition of resistance limits their efficacy. Our objective is to investigate mechanisms of resistance to PARPi in BRCA2-mutant PDAC cells and identify potential therapeutic targets to modulate this resistance. We developed olaparib- and talazoparib-resistant Capan-1 cell lines and characterised their resistance profiles using viability assays, RNA sequencing and metabolomic profiling. We also developed a cisplatin-resistant Capan-1 cell line to compare resistance mechanisms between PARPi and platinum agents. Both olaparib- and talazoparib-resistant cells showed cross-resistance to other PARPi and oxaliplatin, but not to gemcitabine or 5-FU. Talazoparib-resistant cells exhibited a similar resistance profile to cisplatin-resistant cells, including decreased PARP1 expression and altered metabolomic profiles. RNA sequencing and metabolomic profiling revealed significant enrichment of metabolic pathways, including oxidative phosphorylation and glycolysis, in resistant cells. Our study highlights the complexity of resistance mechanisms to PARPi in PDAC and identifies potential therapeutic targets in metabolism. The differences in the resistance profiles between olaparib and talazoparib suggest that PARP-trapping potency may play a role in resistance development. Further research is needed to validate these findings and explore novel therapeutic strategies to overcome resistance to PARPi in PDAC.},

@article{storer_sex-lethal_2025,
 abstract = {The RNA-binding protein Sex-lethal (Sxl) is classically known as a master regulator of sex determination and mRNA splicing in Drosophila melanogaster . However, this role is not conserved across species, and functions beyond this canonical pathway remain poorly understood. In this study, we uncover a splicing-independent role for Sxl at the chromatin level in the Drosophila brain. Using Targeted DamID (TaDa) profiling in neurons, we identify widespread recruitment of Sxl to promoter regions, independent of sex or RNA binding activity. Notably, Sxl chromatin occupancy exhibits near-complete overlap with Polr3E (RPC37), an RNA Polymerase III subunit, with Sxl binding abolished upon Polr3E knockdown. Depletion of Sxl in mature male neurons induces widespread transcriptional changes, particularly in metabolic genes, and improves negative geotaxis during ageing, phenotypes that closely mirror Polr3E knockdown. Conversely, overexpression of the brain-specific Sxl RAC transcript leads to enhanced tRNA synthesis and upregulated metabolic gene expression. Together, these findings reveal a previously unrecognised role for Sxl in regulating Pol III activity via Polr3E, regulating tRNA synthesis and supporting neuronal metabolism. Given the emerging tie between Pol III regulation and neuronal ageing, our study highlights Sxl as a novel modulator of neuronal homeostasis.},

 abstract = {Abstract The present study aimed to explore the genotypic and phenotypic characteristics of biofilm formation in Bulgarian nosocomial Stenotrophomonas maltophilia isolates (n = 221) during the period 2011–2022, by screening for the presence of biofilm-associated genes (BAG) (spgM, rmlA and rpfF), their mutational variability, and assessment of the adherent growth on a polystyrene surface. The methodology included: PCR amplification, whole-genome sequencing (WGS) and crystal violet microtiter plate assay for biofilm quantification. The overall incidence of BAG was: spgM 98.6\%, rmlA 86\%, and rpfF 66.5\%. The most prevalent genotype was spgM+/rmlA+/rpfF+ (56.1\%), followed by spgM+/rmlA+/rpfF- (28.5\%), and spgM+/rmlA-/rpfF+ (9.5\%), with their significant predominance in lower respiratory tract isolates compared to those with other origin (P {\textless} 0.001). All strains examined were characterized as strong biofilm producers (OD550 from 0.224 ± 0.049 to 2.065 ± 0.023) with a single exception that showed a weak biofilm-forming ability (0.177 ± 0.024). No significant differences were observed in the biofilm formation according to the isolation source, as well as among COVID-19 and non-COVID-19 isolates (1.256 ± 0.028 vs. 1.348 ± 0.128, respectively). Also, no correlation was found between the biofilm amounts and the corresponding genotypes. WGS showed that the rmlA accumulated a larger number of variants (0.0086 per base) compared to the other BAG, suggesting no critical role of its product to the biofilm formation. Additionally, two of the isolates were found to harbour class 1 integrons (7-kb and 2.6-kb sized, respectively) containing sul1 in their 3′ conservative ends, which confers sulfonamide resistance. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study on S. maltophilia biofilm formation in Bulgaria, which also identifies novel sequence types (ST819, ST820 and ST826). It demonstrates the complex nature of this adaptive mechanism in the multifactorial pathogenesis of biofilm-associated infections.},

 abstract = {Abstract Cefiderocol (CFDC) is a first-in-class siderophore cephalosporin with potent activity against multidrug-resistant Gram-negative bacteria including carbapenem-resistant Acinetobacter baumannii. The present study aimed to explore the CFDC resistance mechanisms of an extensively drug-resistant A. baumannii isolate from Bulgaria. The A. baumannii Aba52 strain (designated Aba52) was obtained in 2018 from a blood sample of a critically ill patient. The methodology included antimicrobial susceptibility testing, whole-genome sequencing (WGS), reverse transcription quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (RT-qPCR), multilocus sequence typing, and phylogenomic analysis. The isolate demonstrated high-level resistance to CFDC (MIC = 64 mg L−1), resistance to carbapenems, aminoglycosides, fluoroquinolones, sulfamethoxazole-trimethoprim, and tigecycline, as well as susceptibility only to colistin. WGS-based resistome analysis revealed the existence of blaOXA-23, blaOXA-66 and blaADC-73. Seven non-conservative missense mutations affecting iron transport-related genes were detected: exbD4 (p.Ser61Pro), tonB2 (p.Ala268Val), bauA (p.Thr61Ala), ftsI (p.Ala515Val), piuA (p.Gly216Val), and feoB (p.Ser429Pro and p.Thr595Ala). A variety of virulence factors associated with adherence, biofilm formation, enzyme production, immune invasion, iron uptake, quorum sensing, and two-component regulatory systems were identified, suggesting a significant pathogenic potential of Aba52. The performed RT-qPCR analysis showed diminished (0.17) and absent expression of the pirA and piuA genes, respectively, encoding TonB-dependent siderophore receptors. Aba52 belonged to the widespread high-risk sequence type ST2 (Pasteur scheme). To the best of our knowledge, this is the first documented case of CFDC-resistant A. baumannii in Bulgaria even though, CFDC has never been applied in our country. The emerging resistance highlights the crucial need for nationwide surveillance targeting the implementation of novel antibiotics.},

The present study aimed to explore the linezolid resistance mechanisms and genomic characteristics of two vancomycin-susceptible Enterococcus faecalis isolates from Bulgaria. The strains designated Efs2503-bg (inpatient from Pleven) and Efs966-bg (outpatient from Varna) were recovered from wounds in 2018 and 2023, respectively. Antimicrobial susceptibility testing, whole-genome sequencing, multilocus sequence typing, and phylogenomic analysis based on 332 linezolid-resistant E. faecalis genomes were performed. Efs2503-bg was high-level resistant to linezolid (MIC {\textgreater} 256 mg/L) and displayed the G2576T mutation affecting three of the four 23S rDNA loci. Efs966-bg (MIC = 8 mg/L) carried a plasmid-located optrA determinant surrounded by fexA and ermA. No mutations in the genes encoding for ribosomal proteins L3, L4, and L22 were detected. The isolates belonged to the sequence types ST6 (Efs2503-bg) and ST1102 (Efs966-bg). Phylogenomic analysis revealed that Efs2503-bg and Efs966-bg are genetically distinct, with a difference of 12,051 single-nucleotide polymorphisms. To our knowledge, this is the first report of linezolid-resistant enterococci in Bulgaria. Although the global incidence of linezolid-resistant enterococci is still low, their emergence is alarming and poses a growing clinical threat to public health.},

 abstract = {Abstract The present study aimed to explore the virulence characteristics in 221 Bulgarian nosocomial Stenotrophomonas maltophilia isolates (2011–2022) via screening for the presence of virulence genes, their mutational variability, and the corresponding enzyme activity. PCR amplification, enzymatic assays, whole-genome sequencing (WGS), and biofilm quantification on a polystyrene plate were performed. The incidence of virulence determinants was as follows: stmPr1 (encoding for the major extracellular protease StmPr1) 87.3\%, stmPr2 (minor extracellular protease StmPr2) 99.1\%, Smlt3773 locus (outer membrane esterase) 98.2\%, plcN1 (non-hemolytic phospholipase C) 99.1\%, and smf-1 (type-1 fimbriae, biofilm-related gene) 96.4\%. The 1621-bp allele of stmPr1 was most frequently found (61.1\%), followed by the combined allelic variant (17.6\%), stmPr1-negative genotype (12.7\%), and 868-bp allele (8.6\%). Protease, esterase, and lecithinase activity was observed in 95\%, 98.2\%, and 17.2\% of the isolates, respectively. The WGS-subjected isolates (n = 9) formed two groups. Five isolates possessed only the 1621-bp variant of stmPr1, higher biofilm formation ability (Optical Density at λ = 550 nm (OD550): 1.253–1.789), as well as a low number of mutations in the protease genes and smf-1. Three other isolates had only the 868-bp variant, weaker biofilm production (OD550: 0.788–1.108), and higher number of mutations within these genes. The only weak biofilm producer (OD550 = 0.177) had no stmPr1 alleles. In conclusion, the similar PCR detection rates did not allow differentiation of the isolates. In contrast, WGS permitted stmPr1 alleles-based differentiation. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first Bulgarian study presenting genotypic and phenotypic insights into virulence factors of S. maltophilia isolates.},

 abstract = {Carbapenem-resistant Acinetobacter baumannii (CRAB) is designated as an urgent public health threat, both due to its remarkable multidrug resistance and propensity for clonal spread. This study aimed to explore the phenotypic and molecular characteristics of antimicrobial resistance in CRAB isolates (n = 73) from intensive care unit (ICU) patients in two university hospitals in Bulgaria (2018–2019). The methodology included antimicrobial susceptibility testing, PCR, whole-genome sequencing (WGS), and phylogenomic analysis. The resistance rates were as follows: imipenem, 100\%; meropenem, 100\%; amikacin, 98.6\%; gentamicin, 89\%; tobramycin, 86.3\%; levofloxacin, 100\%; trimethoprim–sulfamethoxazole, 75.3\%; tigecycline, 86.3\%; colistin, 0\%; and ampicillin–sulbactam, 13.7\%. All isolates harbored blaOXA-51-like genes. The frequencies of distribution of other antimicrobial resistance genes (ARGs) were: blaOXA-23-like, 98.6\%; blaOXA-24/40-like, 2.7\%; armA, 86.3\%; and sul1, 75.3\%. The WGS of selected extensively drug-resistant A. baumannii (XDR-AB) isolates (n = 3) revealed the presence of OXA-23 and OXA-66 carbapenem-hydrolyzing class D β-lactamases in all isolates, and OXA-72 carbapenemase in one of them. Various insertion sequencies, such as ISAba24, ISAba31, ISAba125, ISVsa3, IS17, and IS6100, were also detected, providing increased ability for horizontal transfer of ARGs. The isolates belonged to the widespread high-risk sequence types ST2 (n = 2) and ST636 (n = 1) (Pasteur scheme). Our results show the presence of XDR-AB isolates, carrying a variety of ARGs, in Bulgarian ICU settings, which highlights the crucial need for nationwide surveillance, especially in the conditions of extensive antibiotic usage during COVID-19.},

Further, comparative benchmarking studies are difficult to perform due to differences in AMR gene prediction accuracy and a lack of agreement in the naming of AMR genes (semantic conformity) for the results obtained.

@article{su_c13-deacylase_2025,
 abstract = {The enzyme C13DAc, isolated and characterized from Nocardioides albus ATCC 55425, represents a novel hydrolase with a classical Ser-His-Asp catalytic triad. Notably, it displays a distinct substrate profile, exhibiting no activity toward conventional esterase substrates such as p-nitrophenyl esters or cinnamate esters. Instead, C13DAc hydrolyzes compounds with a taxane core (e.g., paclitaxel), indicating a specialized biocatalytic function. Computational models provided critical insights into the architecture of the enzyme's active site. Molecular docking simulations revealed the catalytic triad positioned within a hydrophobic pocket and identified hydrophobic residues essential for substrate binding. The mutagenesis of a tyrosine residue led to the complete abolition of activity, thereby indicating an essential role for stabilizing the oxyanion intermediate. The substrate spectrum of C13DAc has been found to correlate with ligand hydrophobicity and structural specificity, thereby supporting the predicted binding mode and suggesting potential substrate combinations for synthetic applications. While transesterification reactions are feasible, the enzymatic esterification required for paclitaxel synthesis remains a significant challenge. These results underscore the potential of C13DAc as a promising candidate for biotransformation processes, particularly in the modification of complex natural products such as paclitaxel derivatives.},

 abstract = {The circulation of Omicron BA.1 led to the rapid increase in severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) cases in South Africa in November 2021, which warranted the use of more rapid detection methods. We, therefore, assessed the ability to detect Omicron BA.1 using genotyping assays to identify specific mutations in SARS-CoV-2 positive samples, Gauteng province, South Africa. The TaqPath™ COVID-19 real-time polymerase chain reaction assay was performed on all samples selected to identify spike gene target failure (SGTF). SARS-CoV-2 genotyping assays were used for the detection of del69/70 and K417N mutation. Whole-genome sequencing was performed on a subset of genotyped samples to confirm these findings. Of the positive samples received, 11.0\% (175/1589) were randomly selected to assess if SGTF and genotyping assays, that detect del69/70 and K417N mutations, could identify Omicron BA.1. We identified SGTF in 98.9\% (173/175) of samples, of which 88.0\% (154/175) had both the del69/70 and K417N mutation. The genotyped samples (45.7\%; 80/175) that were sequenced confirmed Omicron BA.1 (97.5\%; 78/80). Our data show that genotyping for the detection of the del69/70 and K417N coupled with SGTF is efficient to exclude Alpha and Beta variants and rapidly detect Omicron BA.1. However, we still require assays for the detection of unique mutations that will allow for the differentiation between other Omicron sublineages. Therefore, the use of genotyping assays to detect new dominant or emerging lineages of SARS-CoV-2 will be beneficial in limited-resource settings.},

 abstract = {Intra-host diversity studies are used to characterise the mutational heterogeneity of SARS-CoV-2 infections in order to understand the impact of virus-host adaptations. This study investigated the frequency and diversity of the spike (S) protein mutations within SARS-CoV-2 infected South African individuals. The study included SARS-CoV-2 respiratory samples, from individuals of all ages, received at the National Health Laboratory Service at Charlotte Maxeke Johannesburg Academic hospital, Gauteng, South Africa, from June 2020 to May 2022. Single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) assays and whole genome sequencing were performed on a random selection of SARS-CoV-2 positive samples. The allele frequency (AF) was determined using TaqMan Genotyper software for SNP PCR analysis and galaxy.eu for analysis of FASTQ reads from sequencing. The SNP assays identified 5.3\% (50/948) of Delta cases with heterogeneity at delY144 (4\%; 2/50), E484Q (6\%; 3/50), N501Y (2\%; 1/50) and P681H (88\%; 44/50), however only heterogeneity for E484Q and delY144 were confirmed by sequencing. From sequencing we identified 9\% (210/2381) of cases with Beta, Delta, Omicron BA.1, BA.2.15, and BA.4 lineages that had heterogeneity in the S protein. Heterogeneity was primarily identified at positions 19 (1.4\%) with T19IR (AF 0.2–0.7), 371 (92.3\%) with S371FP (AF 0.1–1.0), and 484 (1.9\%) with E484AK (0.2–0.7), E484AQ (AF 0.4–0.5) and E484KQ (AF 0.1–0.4). Mutations at heterozygous amino acid positions 19, 371 and 484 are known antibody escape mutations, however the impact of the combination of multiple substitutions identified at the same position is unknown. Therefore, we hypothesise that intra-host SARS-CoV-2 quasispecies with heterogeneity in the S protein facilitate competitive advantage of variants that can completely/partially evade host’s natural and vaccine-induced immune responses.},

This study investigates the functional, phylogenomic and taxonomic characteristics of 10 completely sequenced Arachnia strains, to elucidate their evolutionary relationships and divergence patterns, focusing on genomic variability and functional diversity. Phylogenetic analyses revealed distinct patterns, with Arachnia propionica strains showing significant divergence compared to the conserved Arachnia rubra strains. Notably, E10012 (=NBRC 14587) emerged as a distinct lineage with unique adaptations, while NCTC11666 exhibited a unique phylogenetic position, suggesting subspecies-level classification. Functional analyses highlighted variability among Arachnia propionica strains, with E10012 (=NBRC 14587) showing genes linked to choline metabolism and metal resistance, and NCTC11666 enriched in carbohydrate-active enzymes like GH179. In contrast, Arachnia rubra demonstrated genomic conservation, indicative of evolutionary specialization. This study reveals that strains E10012 (=NBRC 14587) and NCTC11666 displayed unique genomic features and distinct phylogenetic positioning, suggesting their reclassification as potential novel species and subspecies respectively. This underscores the balance between genomic conservation and diversification in Arachnia, reflecting their ecological adaptability and functional roles in the oral microbiome.},

 abstract = {Antimicrobial-resistant (AMR) bacterial infections caused by clinically important bacteria, including ESKAPE pathogens (Enterococcus faecium, Staphylococcus aureus, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Acinetobacter baumannii, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and Enterobacter species) and mycobacteria (Mycobacterium tuberculosis and nontuberculous mycobacteria), have become a global public health threat. Their epidemic and pandemic clones often accumulate useful accessory genes in their genomes, such as AMR genes (ARGs) and virulence factor genes (VFGs). This process is facilitated by horizontal gene transfer among microbial communities via mobile genetic elements (MGEs), such as plasmids and phages. Nanopore long-read sequencing allows easy and inexpensive analysis of complex bacterial genome structures, although some aspects of sequencing data calculation and genome analysis methods are not systematically understood. Here we describe the latest and most recommended experimental and bioinformatics methods available for the construction of complete bacterial genomes from nanopore sequencing data and the detection and classification of genotypes of bacterial chromosomes, ARGs, VFGs, plasmids, and other MGEs based on their genomic sequences for genomic epidemiological analysis of AMR bacteria.},

In 2017, a higher quality genome assembly for apple was released and is now considered to be the reference genome. Moreover, as in several other species, the identified TCP genes were named based on the relative position of the genes on the chromosomes. The present work consists of an update of the TCP gene family based on the latest genome assembly of M. × domestica. Compared to the previous classification, the number of TCP genes decreased from 52 to 40 as a result of the addition of three sequences and the deduction of 15. An analysis of the intragenic identity led to the identification of 15 pairs of orthologs, shedding light on the forces that shaped the evolution of this gene family. Furthermore, a revised nomenclature system is proposed that is based both on the intragenic identity and the homology with Arabidopsis thaliana (A. thaliana) TCPs in an effort to set a common standard for the TCP classification that will facilitate any future interspecific analysis.},

 abstract = {Vibrio alginolyticus is a Gram-negative bacterium commonly associated with mackerel poisoning. A bacteriophage that specifically targets and lyses this bacterium could be employed as a biocontrol agent for treating the bacterial infection or improving the shelf-life of mackerel products. However, only a few well-characterized V. alginolyticus phages have been reported in the literature. In this study, a novel lytic phage, named ΦImVa-1, specifically infecting V. alginolyticus strain ATCC 17749, was isolated from Indian mackerel. The phage has a short latent period of 15 min and a burst size of approximately 66 particles per infected bacterium. ΦImVa-1 remained stable for 2 h at a wide temperature (27–75 °C) and within a pH range of 5 to 10. Transmission electron microscopy revealed that ΦImVa-1 has an icosahedral head of approximately 60 nm in diameter with a short tail, resembling those in the Schitoviridae family. High throughput sequencing and bioinformatics analysis elucidated that ΦImVa-1 has a linear dsDNA genome of 77,479 base pairs (bp), with a G + C content of {\textasciitilde} 38.72\% and 110 predicted gene coding regions (106 open reading frames and four tRNAs). The genome contains an extremely large virion-associated RNA polymerase gene and two smaller non-virion-associated RNA polymerase genes, which are hallmarks of schitoviruses. No antibiotic genes were found in the ΦImVa-1 genome. This is the first paper describing the biological properties, morphology, and the complete genome of a V. alginolyticus-infecting schitovirus. When raw mackerel fish flesh slices were treated with ΦImVa-1, the pathogen loads reduced significantly, demonstrating the potential of the phage as a biocontrol agent for V. alginolyticus strain ATCC 17749 in the food.},

 abstract = {Background/Objectives: The molecular heterogeneity and metabolic flexibility of Hepatocellular Carcinoma (HCC) pose significant challenges to the efficacy of systemic therapy for advanced cases. Early screening difficulties often delay diagnosis, leading to more advanced stages at presentation. Combined with the inconsistent responses to current systemic therapies, HCC continues to have one of the highest mortality rates among cancers. Thus, this paper seeks to contribute to the development of systemic therapy options through the consideration of HCC’s metabolic vulnerabilities and lay the groundwork for future in vitro studies. Methods: Transcriptomic data were used to calculate single and double knockout options for HCC using genetic Minimal Cut Sets. Furthermore, using QSAR modeling, drug repositioning opportunities were assessed to inhibit the selected genes. Results: Two single knockout options that were also annotated as essential pairs were found within the pyrimidine metabolism pathway of HCC, wherein the knockout of either DHODH or TYMS is potentially disruptive to proliferation. The result of the flux balance analysis and gene knockout simulation indicated a significant decrease in biomass production. Three machine learning algorithms were assessed for their performance in predicting the pIC50 of a given compound for the selected genes. SVM-rbf performed the best on unseen data achieving an R2 of 0.82 for DHODH and 0.81 for TYMS. For DHODH, the drugs Oteseconazole, Tipranavir, and Lusutrombopag were identified as potential inhibitors. For TYMS, the drugs Tadalafil, Dabigatran, Baloxavir Marboxil, and Candesartan Cilexetil showed promise as inhibitors. Conclusions: Overall, this study suggests in vitro testing of the identified drugs to assess their capabilities in inducing pyrimidine starvation on HCC.},

 abstract = {Tempe, a fermented soybean product, plays a significant role in Indonesian dietary culture. Currently, there have been no studies that classify tempe as a functional food using up-to-date genomic data. This research used an Illumina-based meta-transcriptomic method to explore the microbial communities that mainly contribute to tempe fermentation and their functions related to its health benefits. The analysis revealed 8 phyla, 19 families, 20 genera, and 28 species of both bacteria and fungi. The dominant species found were Klebsiella africana, followed by Rhizopus microsporus, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Rhizopus oligosporus, Propionibacterium humerusii, and Lactobacillus brevis. Klebsiella and Propionibacterium are involved in vitamin B12 production, while Rhizopus is associated with GABA production and isoflavones like genistein and daidzein, along with spermidine, caffeic acid, and chlorogenic acid. Lactobacillus contributes proteases, GABA, and beta-glucosidase. The study also strengthened the link between microbes and health benefits by identifying certain microbial genes and their expression levels in the samples. Changes in gene expression reveal how fermentation environments affect diversity and functionality. Overall, finding a variety of bioactive compounds and their genetic backgrounds supports tempe’s position as a functional superfood that could gain global popularity through further research and development.},

To date, the availability of complete mitochondrial genome data within Tellinoidea remains limited, and the taxonomic coverage is still insufficient to resolve its internal controversies. The current study aims to further explore the phylogenetic relationships within Tellinoidea through denser sampling. We have newly sequenced the mitochondrial genomes of 13 species, among which seven genera are being published for the first time. Combined with the published mitogenomes and transcriptomic data, we constructed the most comprehensive Tellinoidea phylogeny to date through maximum likelihood and Bayesian Inference analyses. Our findings support the monophyly of the superfamily Tellinoidea, with Semelidae nesting as a monophyletic group within Tellinidae. We also support the paraphyly of Tellinidae based on the mitochondrial genome data for the first time, identifying that the two subfamilies (Macominae and Tellininae) are polyphyletic. Gene rearrangement analysis reveals a relatively high degree of variation in Semelidae. By expanding the mitochondrial genome dataset, this study provides new insights into the phylogeny of Tellinoidea and underscores the need for further sampling of species to reassess the phylogenetic relationships of Tellinidae and the entire Tellinoidea.},

Here we implemented a saturation mutational scanning platform to screen all 11,520 possible point mutations covering the kinase domains of FGFR1–4. Pooled positive selection screens identified 474 activating and 738 mutations mediating resistance to the FGFR inhibitors pemigatinib and futibatinib, together revealing 301 druggable FGFR mutations analogous to a strong PS3/BS3 evidence level. The screens also identified loss-of-function mutations and an association of gain-of-function mutations with hydrophobic changes. The functional screens identified 97\% of acquired resistance mutations in clinical trials.

 abstract = {Abstract The essential splicing factor U2AF65 is known to help anchoring U2 snRNP at the branch site. Its C-terminal UHM domain interacts with ULM motifs of SF3b155, an U2 snRNP protein. Here, we report a cooperative binding of U2AF65 and the related protein CAPERα to the multi-ULM domain of SF3b155. In addition, we show that the RS domain of U2AF65 drives a liquid?liquid phase separation that is amplified by intronic RNA with repeated pyrimidine tracts. In cells, knockdown of either U2AF65 or CAPERα improves the inclusion of cassette exons that are preceded by such repeated pyrimidine-rich motifs. These results support a model in which liquid-like assemblies of U2AF65 and CAPERα on repetitive pyrimidine-rich RNA sequences are driven by their RS domains, and facilitate the recruitment of the multi-ULM domain of SF3b155. We anticipate that posttranslational modifications and proteins recruited in dynamical U2AF65 and CAPERα condensates may further contribute to the complex mechanisms leading to specific splice site choice that occurs in cells.},

@article{tascini_oxa-carbapenemases_2025,
 abstract = {Objective
Carbapenem- resistant A. baumannii (CRAB) isolates represent a serious public health concern. Recently, a novel molecule, the cefiderocol (FDC), has emerged as promising therapeutic option for CRAB infections. In the present study, we analyzed the genomes of five A. baumannii ST2 isolated from four hospitalized patients. All patients were treated with FDC and ampicillin/sulbactam (AMP/SUL) combination.
Methods
Whole-genome sequencing of the five CRAB isolates was performed using an Illumina MiSeq instrument. A detailed bioinformatic analysis was carried out to acquire information about genotyping, antimicrobial resistance genes (ARGs), virulence associated genes (VAGs), single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) and phylogenetic tree of the five CRAB isolates.
Results
Among the five CRAB isolates, only three (Ab.2, Ab.3 and Ab.4) exhibited resistance to FDC. The genomes of all isolates were highly similar, and MLST analysis indicated they all belong to sequence type 2 (ST2), corresponding to international clone 2. Phylogenetic analysis suggests that isolates Ab.2, Ab.3 and Ab.4 may share a common ancestor or be linked by a possible transmission event. In contrast, isolates Ab.1 and Ab.5 were more divergent from the other three. Nevertheless, all five isolates harbored the same ARGs and VAGs. The OXA-23, OXA-66 and ADC-25 β-lactamases were detected in all strains. The FDC-non-susceptible isolates showed K235N/H370Y double mutation within PBP3, along with a G370C substitution in PBP1a.
Conclusion
The four clinical cases described in this study represent an important example of efficacy and good practice of FDC plus AMP/SUL combination in the treatment of critical patients suffering from CRAB infections.},

 abstract = {The WHIRLY (WHY) family of DNA/RNA binding proteins fulfil multiple but poorly characterised functions in plants. We analysed WHY protein functions in the Arabidopsis Atwhy1, Atwhy3, Atwhy1why3 single and double mutants and wild type controls. The Atwhy3 and Atwhy1why3 double mutants showed a significant delay in flowering, having more siliques per plant but with fewer seeds per silique than the wild type. While germination was similar in the unaged high-quality seeds of all lines, significant decreases in vigour and viability were observed in the aged mutant seeds compared with the wild type. Imbibition of unaged high-quality seeds was characterised by large increases in transcripts that encode proteins involved in oxygen sensing and responses to hypoxia. Seed aging resulted in a disruption of the imbibition-induced transcriptome profile such that transcripts encoding RNA metabolism and processing became the most abundant components of the imbibition signature. The imbibition-related profile of the Atwhy1why3 mutant seeds, was characterised by decreased expression of hypoxia-related and oxygen metabolism genes even in the absence of aging. Seed aging further decreased the abundance of hypoxia-related and oxygen metabolism transcripts relative to the wild type. These findings suggest that the WHY1 and WHY3 proteins regulate the imbibition-induced responses to oxygen availability and hypoxia. Loss of WHY1 and WHY3 functions decreases the ability of Arabidopsis seeds to resist the adverse effects of seed aging.},

 abstract = {The Baltic Sea is a shallow basin of brackish water in which the spatial salinity gradient is one of the most important factors contributing to species distribution. The Baltic Sea is infamous for its annual cyanobacterial blooms comprised of Nodularia spumigena, Aphanizomenon spp., and Dolichospermum spp. that cause harm, especially for recreational users. To broaden our knowledge of the cyanobacterial adaptation strategies for brackish water environments, we sequenced the entire genome of Dolichospermum sp. UHCC 0315, a species occurring not only in freshwater environments but also in brackish water. Comparative genomics analyses revealed a close association with Dolichospermum sp. UHCC 0090 isolated from a lake in Finland. The genome closure of Dolichospermum sp. UHCC 0315 unraveled a mixture of two subtypes in the original culture, and subtypes exhibited distinct buoyancy phenotypes. Salinity less than 3 g L−1 NaCl enabled proper growth of Dolichospermum sp. UHCC 0315, whereas growth was arrested at moderate salinity (6 g L−1 NaCl). The concentrations of toxins, microcystins, increased at moderate salinity, whereas RNA sequencing data implied that Dolichospermum remodeled its primary metabolism in unfavorable high salinity. Based on our results, the predicted salinity decrease in the Baltic Sea may favor toxic blooms of Dolichospermum spp.},

 abstract = {The vast ecosystem of single-cell RNA-sequencing tools has until recently been plagued by an excess of diverging analysis strategies, inconsistent file formats, and compatibility issues between different software suites. The uptake of 10x Genomics datasets has begun to calm this diversity, and the bioinformatics community leans once more towards the large computing requirements and the statistically driven methods needed to process and understand these ever-growing datasets.Here we outline several Galaxy workflows and learning resources for single-cell RNA-sequencing, with the aim of providing a comprehensive analysis environment paired with a thorough user learning experience that bridges the knowledge gap between the computational methods and the underlying cell biology. The Galaxy reproducible bioinformatics framework provides tools, workflows, and trainings that not only enable users to perform 1-click 10x preprocessing but also empower them to demultiplex raw sequencing from custom tagged and full-length sequencing protocols. The downstream analysis supports a range of high-quality interoperable suites separated into common stages of analysis: inspection, filtering, normalization, confounder removal, and clustering. The teaching resources cover concepts from computer science to cell biology. Access to all resources is provided at the singlecell.usegalaxy.eu portal.The reproducible and training-oriented Galaxy framework provides a sustainable high-performance computing environment for users to run flexible analyses on both 10x and alternative platforms. The tutorials from the Galaxy Training Network along with the frequent training workshops hosted by the Galaxy community provide a means for users to learn, publish, and teach single-cell RNA-sequencing analysis.},

 abstract = {Cancer cells infiltrating surrounding tissue frequently undergo partial epithelial-mesenchymal transitions (pEMT) and employ a collective mode of invasion. How these phenotypic traits are regulated and interconnected remains underexplored. Here, we used intestinal organoids with colorectal cancer (CRC) driver mutations as model system to investigate the mechanistic basis of TGF-β1-induced pEMT and collective invasion. By scRNA-seq we identified multiple cell subpopulations representing a broad pEMT spectrum, where the most advanced pEMT state correlated with the transcriptional profiles of leader cells in collective invasion and a poor prognosis mesenchymal subtype of human CRC. Bioinformatic analyses pinpointed Sox11 as a transcription factor gene whose expression peaked in the potential leader/pEMThigh cells. Immunofluorescence staining confirmed Sox11 expression in cells at the invasive front of TGF-β1-treated organoids. Loss-of-function and overexpression experiments showed that Sox11 is necessary, albeit not sufficient, for TGF-β1-induced pEMT and collective invasion. In human CRC samples, elevated SOX11 expression was associated with advanced tumor stages and worse prognosis. Unexpectedly, aside from orchestrating the organoid response to TGF-β1, Sox11 controlled expression of genes related to normal gut function and tumor suppression. Apparently, Sox11 is embedded in several distinct gene regulatory circuits, contributing to intestinal tissue homeostasis, tumor suppression, and TGF-β-mediated cancer cell invasion.},

 abstract = {The mitochondrial genomes of apicomplexans comprise merely three protein-coding genes, alongside a set of thirty to forty genes encoding small RNAs (sRNAs), many of which exhibit homologies to rRNA from E. coli. The expression status and integration of these short RNAs into ribosomes remains unclear and direct evidence for active ribosomes within apicomplexan mitochondria is still lacking. In this study, we conducted small RNA sequencing on the apicomplexan Toxoplasma gondii to investigate the occurrence and function of mitochondrial sRNAs. To enhance the analysis of sRNA sequencing outcomes, we also re-sequenced the T. gondii mitochondrial genome using an improved organelle enrichment protocol and Nanopore sequencing. It has been established previously that the T. gondii genome comprises 21 sequence blocks that undergo recombination among themselves but that their order is not entirely random. The enhanced coverage of the mitochondrial genome allowed us to characterize block combinations at increased resolution. Employing this refined genome for sRNA mapping, we find that many small RNAs originated from the junction sites between protein-coding blocks and rRNA sequence blocks. Surprisingly, such block border sRNAs were incorporated into polysomes together with canonical rRNA fragments and mRNAs. In conclusion, apicomplexan ribosomes are active within polysomes and are indeed assembled through the integration of sRNAs, including previously undetected sRNAs with merged mRNA-rRNA sequences. Our findings lead to the hypothesis that T. gondii’s block-based genome organization enables the dual utilization of mitochondrial sequences as both messenger RNAs and ribosomal RNAs, potentially establishing a link between the regulation of rRNA and mRNA expression.},

Although little is known about the virulence factors involved in the disease pathogenesis, a comprehensive comparative genome analysis of \textit{T. pyogenes} genomes has not been performed till date. Hence, present investigation was carried out to characterize and compare 19 \textit{T. pyogenes} genomes originating in different geographical origins including the draftgenome of the first Indian origin strain \textit{T. pyogenes} Bu5. Additionally, candidate virulence determinants that could be crucial for their pathogenesis were also detected and analyzed by using various bioinformatics tools. The pan-genome calculations revealed an open pan-genome of \textit{T. pyogenes}. In addition, an inventory of virulence related genes, 190 genomic islands, 31 prophage sequences, and 40 antibiotic resistance genes that could play a significant role in organism's pathogenicity were detected. The core-genome based phylogeny of \textit{T. pyogenes} demonstrates a polyphyletic, host-associated group with a high degree of genomic diversity. The identified core-genome can be further used for screening of drug and vaccine targets. The investigation has provided unique insights into pan-genome, virulome, mobiliome, and resistome of \textit{T. pyogenes} genomes and laid the foundation for future investigations.},

This study investigates transcriptomic alterations in rodent models of ICH and severe ICH to shed light on the genetic pathways involved in hemorrhagic brain injury. We performed principal component analysis, revealing distinct principal component segments of normal rats compared to ICH and severe ICH rats. We employed heatmaps and volcano plots to identify differentially expressed genes and utilized bar plots and KEGG pathway analysis to elucidate the molecular pathways involved. We identified a multitude of differentially expressed genes in both the ICH and severe ICH models. Our results revealed 5679 common genes among the normal, ICH, and severe ICH groups in the upregulated genes group, and 1196 common genes in the downregulated genes, respectively. A volcano plot comparing these groups further highlighted common genes, including PDPN, TIMP1, SERPINE1, TUBB6, and CD44. These findings underscore the complex interplay of genes involved in inflammation, oxidative stress, and neuronal damage. Furthermore, pathway enrichment analysis uncovered key signaling pathways, including the TNF signaling pathway, protein processing in the endoplasmic reticulum, MAPK signaling pathway, and Fc gamma R-mediated phagocytosis, implicated in the pathogenesis of ICH.},

This study investigated how four P fertilization treatments-no phosphorus (P0), bone char (BC), surface-modified bone char plus (BC$^{\textrm{plus}}$), and triple superphosphate (TSP)-with increasing solubility influence microbial recruitment and diversity in Pisum sativum, leading to differences in plant-available phosphorus across bulk soil, rhizosphere, roots, and nodules.{\textless}h4{\textgreater}Results{\textless}/h4{\textgreater}Using 16S rRNA amplicon sequencing, we found that nodule-associated microbial communities were primarily recruited from unknown sources, likely seeds, followed by roots, especially under BC$^{\textrm{plus}}$. Phosphorus solubility of treatments significantly influenced recruitment patterns, with solubility further shaping microbial diversity. BC$^{\textrm{plus}}$ recruited beneficial taxa like Beijerinckiaceae and Flavobacteriaceae, which are associated with nitrogen fixation and biocontrol. In contrast, the highly soluble TSP treatment expanded recruitment from the rhizosphere, reflecting less stringent environmental filtering and promoting taxa like Steroidobacteraceae and Blastocatellaceae, known for nutrient cycling and pathogen suppression. In the absence of P fertilization (P0), recruitment relied heavily on seeds and roots, with arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi colonization prioritized over nodulation.

@article{then_plant_2021,
 abstract = {Alighting aphids probe a new host plant by intracellular test punctures for suitability. These induce immediate calcium signals that emanate from the punctured sites and might be the first step in plant recognition of aphid feeding and the subsequent elicitation of plant defence responses. Calcium is also involved in the transmission of non-persistent plant viruses that are acquired by aphids during test punctures. Therefore, we wanted to determine whether viral infection alters calcium signalling. For this, calcium signals triggered by aphids were imaged on transgenic \textit{Arabidopsis} plants expressing the cytosolic FRET-based calcium reporter YC3.6-NES and infected with the non-persistent viruses cauliflower mosaic (CaMV) and turnip mosaic (TuMV), or the persistent virus, turnip yellows (TuYV). Aphids were placed on infected leaves and calcium elevations were recorded by time-lapse fluorescence microscopy. Calcium signal velocities were significantly slower in plants infected with CaMV or TuMV and signal areas were smaller in CaMV-infected plants. Transmission tests using CaMV-infected \textit{Arabidopsis} mutants impaired in pathogen perception or in the generation of calcium signals revealed no differences in transmission efficiency. A transcriptomic meta-analysis indicated significant changes in expression of receptor-like kinases in the BAK1 pathway as well as of calcium channels in CaMV- and TuMV-infected plants. Taken together, infection with CaMV and TuMV, but not with TuYV, impacts aphid-induced calcium signalling. This suggests that viruses can modify plant responses to aphids from the very first vector/host contact.},

This study presents the first comprehensive analysis of A. glutinosa root nodules under heavy metal stress, focusing on a 30-year-old chronosequence planted upon opencast coal mine spoil. Microbial diversity analysis revealed that A. glutinosa nodules harbour a distinct and conserved microbiome, dominated by Frankiaceae but also enriched with plant growth-promoting bacteria such as Bradyrhizobium, Mycobacterium, and Actinoplanes. Additionally, despite similar beta diversity between the nodules and soil, significant compositional differences were observed, reinforcing the selective nature of the nodules. However, functional profiling indicated that metabolic pathways were largely shared between nodule and soil microbiomes. Overall, this study provides new insights into the resilience and specialisation of the A. glutinosa nodule microbiome and its potential role in bioremediation within heavy metal-contaminated environments.},

 abstract = {Anaerobic lignocellulosic microbial consortia are known to be prodigiously efficient at converting lignocellulosic biomass to methane. In this study, the efficacy of anaerobic fungal consortia (AFC) from five different inocula, including Bubalus bubalis rumen fluid (RU), in degrading filter paper, microcrystalline cellulose, and rice straw (RS), was screened. The AFC from RU performed best in lignocellulosic material degradation and methane production; thus, RU was selected for further experiments. Consecutive batch subculturing (CBS) was performed in RU to enrich and stabilize the dominant and key microorganisms categorized as anaerobic fungi, using the addition of antibacterial agents to suppress the growth of untargeted bacteria. After the CBS, subculture E19 proved the most efficient, with RS degradation of 84\% and a methane yield of 310 mL/g VSadded, representing 1.83- and 2.25-fold increases compared to the initial seed, respectively. The microbial community of E19 consisted of anaerobic fungi (uncultured Neocallimastigales, Anaeromyces sp., Orpinomyces sp., and Feramyces sp.) coexisting with anaerobic bacteria (streptomycin resistant Proteiniphilum acetatigenes), and methanogens. The E19 consortium was able to use various carbon sources (87.5\%) and contained potential genes encoding enzymes involved in RS degradation. The microbial community of E19 was highly stable, making it a promising inoculum for biomass degradation, especially for anaerobic digestion to produce biogas.},

Previous work has shown that myelin debris can overwhelm the metabolic capacity of microglia, thereby impeding tissue regeneration in aging, but the underlying mechanisms are unknown. In a model of demyelination, we found that a substantial number of genes that were not effectively activated in aged myeloid cells displayed epigenetic modifications associated with restricted chromatin accessibility. Ablation of two class I histone deacetylases in microglia was sufficient to restore the capacity of aged mice to remyelinate lesioned tissue. We used Bacillus Calmette-Guerin (BCG), a live-attenuated vaccine, to train the innate immune system and detected epigenetic reprogramming of brain-resident myeloid cells and functional restoration of myelin debris clearance and lesion recovery. Our results provide insight into aging-associated decline in myeloid function and how this decay can be prevented by innate immune reprogramming.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

Subtle modifications in such early events are likely to have major impacts in later morphogenesis, bringing along morphological diversification. Here, comparing the blind cave and the surface morphotypes of Astyanax mexicanus fish, we found heterochronies during gastrulation that produce organizer and axial mesoderm tissues with different properties (including differences in the expression of dkk1b) that may have contributed to cavefish brain evolution. These variations observed during gastrulation depend fully on maternal factors. The developmental evolution of retinal morphogenesis and hypothalamic patterning are among those traits that retained significant maternal influence at larval stages. Transcriptomic analysis of fertilized eggs from both morphotypes and reciprocal F1 hybrids showed a strong and specific maternal signature. Our work strongly suggests that maternal effect genes and developmental heterochronies that occur during gastrulation have impacted morphological brain change during cavefish evolution.},

@article{torres-tiji_bioinformatic_2024,
 abstract = {Algae biotechnology holds immense promise for revolutionizing the bioeconomy through the sustainable and scalable production of various bioproducts. However, their development has been hindered by the lack of advanced genetic tools. This study introduces a synthetic biology approach to develop such tools, focusing on the construction and testing of synthetic promoters. By analyzing conserved DNA motifs within the promoter regions of highly expressed genes across six different algal species, we identified cis-regulatory elements (CREs) associated with high transcriptional activity. Combining the algorithms POWRS, STREME, and PhyloGibbs, we predicted 1511 CREs and inserted them into a minimal synthetic promoter sequence in 1, 2, or 3 copies, resulting in 4533 distinct synthetic promoters. These promoters were evaluated in vivo for their capacity to drive the expression of a transgene in a high-throughput manner through next-generation sequencing post antibiotic selection and fluorescence-activated cell sorting. To validate our approach, we sequenced hundreds of transgenic lines showing high levels of GFP expression. Further, we individually tested 14 identified promoters, revealing substantial increases in GFP expression─up to nine times higher than the baseline synthetic promoter, with five matching or even surpassing the performance of the native AR1 promoter. As a result of this study, we identified a catalog of CREs that can now be used to build superior synthetic algal promoters. More importantly, here we present a validated pipeline to generate building blocks for innovative synthetic genetic tools applicable to any algal species with a sequenced genome and transcriptome data set.},

@article{tosar_ri-sec-seq_2021,
 abstract = {Exosomes and other extracellular vesicles (EVs) are considered the main vehicles transporting RNAs in extracellular samples, including human bodily fluids. However, a major proportion of extracellular RNAs (exRNAs) do not copurify with EVs and remain in ultracentrifugation supernatants of cell-conditioned medium or blood serum. We have observed that nonvesicular exRNA profiles are highly biased toward those RNAs with intrinsic resistance to extracellular ribonucleases. These highly resistant exRNAs are interesting from a biomarker point of view, but are not representative of the actual bulk of RNAs released to the extracellular space. In order to understand exRNA dynamics and capture both stable and unstable RNAs, we developed a method based on size-exclusion chromatography (SEC) fractionation of RNase inhibitor (RI)-treated cell-conditioned medium (RI-SEC-seq). This method has allowed us to identify and study extracellular ribosomes and tRNAs, and offers a dynamical view of the extracellular RNAome which can impact biomarker discovery in the near future. \textbf{Graphical abstract:} \textbf{Overview of the RI-SEC-seq protocol: sequencing of size-exclusion chromatography fractions from nonvesicular extracellular samples treated or not with RNase inhibitors (+/- RI)}.},

 abstract = {Phytoplasmas are linked to diseases in hundreds of economically important crops, including carrots. In carrots, phytoplasmosis is associated with leaf chlorosis and necrosis, coupled with inhibited root system development, ultimately leading to significant economic losses. During a field study conducted in Baden-Württemberg (Germany), two strains of the provisional taxon ‘Candidatus Phytoplasma asteris’ were identified within a carrot plot. For further analysis, strains M8 and M33 underwent shotgun sequencing, utilising single-molecule-real-time (SMRT) long-read sequencing and sequencing-by-synthesis (SBS) paired-end short-read sequencing techniques. Hybrid assemblies resulted in complete de novo assemblies of two genomes harboring circular chromosomes and two plasmids. Analyses, including average nucleotide identity and sequence comparisons of established marker genes, confirmed the phylogenetic divergence of ‘Ca. P. asteris’ and a different assignment of strains to the 16S rRNA subgroup I-A for M33 and I-B for M8. These groups exhibited unique features, encompassing virulence factors and genes, associated with the mobilome. In contrast, pan-genome analysis revealed a highly conserved gene set related to metabolism across these strains. This analysis of the Aster Yellows (AY) group reaffirms the perception of phytoplasmas as bacteria that have undergone extensive genome reduction during their co-evolution with the host and an increase of genome size by mobilome.},

This study aims to characterize the virulome, resistome, and population structure of E. coli ST131 isolates from clinical blood samples in Hungary. A total of 30 C2/H30Rx and 33 C1-M27 ST131 isolates were selected for Illumina MiSeq sequencing and 30 isolates for MinION sequencing, followed by hybrid de novo assembly. Five C2/H30Rx and one C1-M27 cluster were identified. C1-M27 isolates harbored the F1:A2:B20 plasmid in 93.9\% of cases. Long-read sequencing revealed that blaCTX-M-27 was on plasmids. Among the C2/H30Rx isolates, only six isolates carried the C2-associated F2:A1:B- plasmid type. Of 19 hybrid-assembled C2/H30Rx genomes, the blaCTX-M-15 gene was located on plasmid only in one isolate, while in the other isolates, ISEcp1 or IS26-mediated chromosomal integration of blaCTX-M-15 was detected in unique variations. In one isolate a part of F2:A1:B- plasmid integrated into the chromosome. These results suggest that CTX-M-15-producing C2/H30Rx and CTX-M-27-producing C1-M27 subclades may have emerged and spread in different ways in Hungary. While blaCTX-M-27 was carried mainly on the C1/H30R-associated F1:A2:B20 plasmid, the IncF-like plasmids of C2/H30Rx or its composite transposons have been incorporated into the chromosome through convergent evolutionary processes.},

 abstract = {Bacteriophage (phage) therapy is a promising means to combat drug-resistant bacterial pathogens. Infection by phage can select for mutations in bacterial populations that confer resistance against phage infection. However, resistance against phage can yield evolutionary trade-offs of biomedical relevance. Here, we report the discovery that infection by certain staphylococcal phages sensitizes different strains of methicillin-resistant \textit{Staphylococcus aureus} (MRSA) to β-lactams, a class of antibiotics against which MRSA is typically resistant. MRSA cells that survive infection by these phages display significant reductions in minimal inhibitory concentration against different β-lactams compared to uninfected bacteria. Transcriptomic profiling reveals that these evolved MRSA strains possess highly modulated transcriptional profiles, where numerous genes involved in \textit{S. aureus} virulence are downregulated. Phage-treated MRSA exhibited attenuated virulence phenotypes in the form of reduced hemolysis and clumping. Despite sharing similar phenotypes, whole-sequencing analysis revealed that the different MRSA strains evolved unique genetic profiles during infection. These results suggest complex evolutionary trajectories in MRSA during phage predation and open up new possibilities to reduce drug resistance and virulence in MRSA infections.},

We report here on a molecular study of the process of sexual differentiation in the immature inflorescence of oil palm (Elaeis guineensis). This species is monoecious and exhibits gender diphasy, producing male and female inflorescences separately on the same plant in alternation. Three main approaches were used: small RNA-seq to characterise and study the expression of miRNA genes; RNA-seq to monitor mRNA accumulation patterns; hormone quantification to assess the role of cytokinins and auxins in inflorescence differentiation. Our study allowed the characterisation of 30 previously unreported palm MIRNA genes. In differential gene and miRNA expression studies, we identified a number of key developmental genes and miRNA-mRNA target modules previously described in relation to their developmental regulatory role in the cereal panicle, notably the miR156/529/535-SQUAMOSA PROMOTER-BINDING PROTEIN-LIKE (SPL) gene regulatory module. Gene enrichment analysis highlighted the importance of hormone-related genes, and this observation was corroborated by the detection of much higher levels of cytokinins in the female inflorescence. Our data illustrate the importance of branching regulation within the developmental window studied, during which the female inflorescence, unlike its male counterpart, produces flower clusters on new successive axes by sympodial growth.},

Five cases of Chryseobacterium spp. infection were recorded in the Gastroenterology Department (Pavilion A) and one in the Vertebral Surgery Department (Pavilion B). C. indologenes was identified in blood and tracheal aspirate samples using MALDI-TOF MS. Environmental analysis carried out in the pavilions A and B isolated C. indologenes from sink tap in Pavilion B. Subsequently, genome sequencing revealed that Chryseobacterium strains misidentified as C. indologenes were more closely related to C. arthrosphaerae. Genetic analysis confirmed the cluster hypothesis involving four patients from the pavilion A, while no genetic link was found between the environmental and clinical strains. Innovative molecular methods in clinical and environmental investigations have allowed more accurate identification of the etiologic agent and possibly tracing the source of infection in the nosocomial setting. Control measures, such as patient isolation and room disinfection, have prevented the spread of infection.},

The aim ofthis study was to assess the antifibrotic effects of anti-S100A4 monoclonal antibody (mAb) in murine models of SScand in precision cut skin slices of patients with SSc.Methods.The effects of anti-S100A4 mAbs were evaluated in a bleomycin-induced skinfibrosis model and inTsk-1 mice with a therapeutic dosing regimen. In addition, the effects of anti-S100A4 mAbs on precision cut SSc skinslices were analyzed by RNA sequencing.Results.Inhibition of S100A4 was effective in the treatment of pre-established bleomycin-induced skinfibrosis andin regression of pre-establishedfibrosis with reduced dermal thickening, myofibroblast counts, and collagen accumu-lation. Transcriptional profiling demonstrated targeting of multiple profibrotic and proinflammatory processes relevantto the pathogenesis of SSc on targeted S100A4 inhibition in a bleomycin-induced skinfibrosis model. Moreover, tar-geted S100A4 inhibition also modulated inflammation- andfibrosis-relevant gene sets in precision cut SSc skin slicesin an ex vivo trial approach. Selected downstream targets of S100A4, such as AMP-activated protein kinase,calsequestrin-1, and phosphorylated STAT3, were validated on the protein level, and STAT3 inhibition was shown toprevent the profibrotic effects of S100A4 onfibroblasts in human skin.Conclusion.Inhibition of S100A4 confers dual targeting of inflammatory andfibrotic pathways in complementarymouse models offibrosis and in SSc skin. These effects support the further development of anti-S100A4 mAbs asdisease-modifying targeted therapies for SSc.},

 abstract = {Pseudomonas aeruginosa possesses one of the most complex bacterial regulatory networks, which largely contributes to its success as a pathogen. However, most of its transcription factors (TFs) are still uncharacterized and the potential intra-species variability in regulatory networks has been mostly ignored so far. Here, we used DAP-seq to map the genome-wide binding sites of all 55 DNA-binding two-component systems (TCSs) response regulators (RRs) across the three major P. aeruginosa lineages. The resulting networks encompass about 40\% of all genes in each strain and contain numerous new regulatory interactions across most major physiological processes. Strikingly, about half of the detected targets are specific to only one or two strains, revealing a previously unknown large functional diversity of TFs within a single species. Three main mechanisms were found to drive this diversity, including differences in accessory genome content, as exemplified by the strain-specific plasmid in IHMA87 outlier strain which harbors numerous binding sites of conserved chromosomally-encoded RRs. Additionally, most RRs display potential auto-regulation or RR-RR cross-regulation, bringing to light the vast complexity of this network. Overall, we provide the first complete delineation of the TCSs regulatory network in P. aeruginosa that will represent an important resource for future studies on this pathogen.},

 abstract = {Transcription factors (TFs) are instrumental in the bacterial response to new environmental conditions. They can act as direct signal sensors and subsequently induce changes in gene expression leading to physiological adaptation. Here, by combining transcriptome sequencing (RNA-seq) and cistrome determination (DAP-seq), we studied a family of eight TFs in \textit{Pseudomonas aeruginosa} This family, encompassing TFs with XRE-like DNA-binding and cupin signal-sensing domains, includes the metabolic regulators ErfA, PsdR, and PauR and five so-far-unstudied TFs. The genome-wide delineation of their regulons identified 39 regulatory interactions with genes mostly involved in metabolism. We found that the XRE-cupin TFs are inhibitors of their neighboring genes, forming local, functional units encoding proteins with functions in condition-specific metabolic pathways. Growth phenotypes of isogenic mutants highlighted new roles for PauR and PA0535 in polyamines and arginine metabolism. The phylogenetic analysis of this family of regulators across the bacterial kingdom revealed a wide diversity of such metabolic regulatory modules and identified species with potentially higher metabolic versatility. Numerous genes encoding uncharacterized XRE-cupin TFs were found near metabolism-related genes, illustrating the need of further systematic characterization of transcriptional regulatory networks in order to better understand the mechanisms of bacterial adaptation to new environments.\textbf{IMPORTANCE} Bacteria of the \textit{Pseudomonas} genus, including the major human pathogen \textit{Pseudomonas aeruginosa}, are known for their complex regulatory networks and high number of transcription factors, which contribute to their impressive adaptive ability. However, even in the most studied species, most of the regulators are still uncharacterized. With the recent advances in high-throughput sequencing methods, it is now possible to fill this knowledge gap and help the understanding of how bacteria adapt and thrive in new environments. By leveraging these methods, we provide an example of a comprehensive analysis of an entire family of transcription factors and bring new insights into metabolic and regulatory adaptation in the \textit{Pseudomonas} genus.},

 abstract = {Bacterial endospores (spores) are among the most resistant living forms on earth. Spores of \textit{Bacillus subtilis} A163 show extremely high resistance to wet heat compared to spores of laboratory strains. In this study, we found that spores of \textit{B. subtilis} A163 were indeed very wet heat resistant and released dipicolinic acid (DPA) very slowly during heat treatment. We also determined the proteome of vegetative cells and spores of \textit{B. subtilis} A163 and the differences in these proteomes from those of the laboratory strain PY79, spores of which are much less heat resistant. This proteomic characterization identified 2011 proteins in spores and 1901 proteins in vegetative cells of \textit{B. subtilis} A163. Surprisingly, spore morphogenic protein SpoVM had no homologs in \textit{B. subtilis} A163. Comparing protein expression between these two strains uncovered 108 proteins that were differentially present in spores and 93 proteins differentially present in cells. In addition, five of the seven proteins on an operon in strain A163, which is thought to be primarily responsible for this strain's spores high heat resistance, were also identified. These findings reveal proteomic differences of the two strains exhibiting different resistance to heat and form a basis for further mechanistic analysis of the high heat resistance of \textit{B. subtilis} A163 spores.},

 abstract = {Characterizing the complex web of ecological interactions is a central challenge in molecular ecology. Shotgun metagenomics of environmental samples offers a powerful, high-resolution approach, yet its potential for simultaneously generating multiple genomic resources from different trophic levels remains underexplored. This study serves as a proof-of-concept, using deep sequencing of a single, complex sample—the larval food of the stingless bee Tetragonisca angustula—to demonstrate the method's capacity to recover genomic information across varying template abundances. We successfully assembled three genomes of different completeness levels: a near-complete bacterial genome (Acetilactobacillus jinshanensis, 2,097,977 bp with 0.002\% ambiguous bases), a draft mitochondrial genome (T. angustula, 15,498–15,549 bp), and a fragmented chloroplast genome (Lactuca sativa, 130,532 bp with 23.47\% ambiguous bases). The assembly quality gradient, observed from complete to fragmented, directly reflects the relative abundance of each DNA template in the environmental sample, demonstrating the method's sensitivity and ecological informativeness. Beyond these genomic resources, the data provided a comprehensive biodiversity profile, revealing DNA from seven major taxonomic groups, including 209 bacterial genera, 123 plant families, and 55 insect taxa. Additionally, genomic comparisons using Average Nucleotide Identity (ANI) and digital DNA–DNA Hybridization (dDDH) analyses suggest that the dominant bacterial strain represents a putative novel species within the genus Acetilactobacillus. This approach simultaneously provided insights into host genetics, food sources, and microbial communities, illustrating the potential of single metagenomic datasets to generate multiple valuable genomic resources for molecular ecology research.},

 abstract = {RNA-Sequencing (RNA-Seq) of peripheral blood can be a valuable source of information for investigating the status and mechanism of diseases. However, blood contains 50–80\% unwanted hemoglobin (Hb) transcripts. Lexogen’s QuantSeq mRNA-Seq-Kit for Illumina RNA-Seq features a ‘Globin Block’ (GB) module that depletes Hb cDNAs during library preparation. Here, we aimed to assess GB’s effectiveness and checked for technical biases attributable to GB. Using whole blood total RNA samples of 91 healthy individuals, we sequenced 91 pairs of GB and non-blocked samples (noGB) on Illumina HiSeq2500 and 8 pairs of GB/noGB technical replicates on HiSeq4000. GB reduced the fraction of Hb transcripts from 43\% (s.d. 14\%) to 8.0\% (s.d. 4.3\%). From GB samples we detected 1,397 more expressed genes at approximately 11 million reads per RNA-isolate. Enrichment and differential expression analyses did not reveal significant differences for GB and noGB samples with respect to molecular function. In contrast to results from studies that have examined the performance of GB during RNA isolation, we were able to assign GB to corresponding noGB samples (from multiple sequencing runs on HiSeq2500) with at least 89.8\% accuracy from the complete correlation matrix of all GB/GB, noGB/noGB and GB/noGB pairs. However, the use of different sequencers (HiSeq2500 vs HiSeq4000) impaired assignment of technical replicates, whereas assignment of GB to corresponding noGB samples worked perfectly when sequencing on one lane on HiSeq4000. Lexogen’s GB RNA-Seq module is a valuable addition during mRNA-Seq library preparation which works even with low amounts of input total RNA (50 ng per sample). GB facilitated the detection of low abundant transcripts and yielded more non-hemoglobin reads, while preserving biological information. We observed that differences in sequencing run and platform have a far greater effect on technical variation than the use of GB.},

This study reports total mitogenome of Psorodonotus ebneri Brunner von Wattenwyl, 1861 (Orthoptera: Tettigoniidae), highlighting selection profile and intraspecific and interspecific divergence in protein-coding genes (PCGs). To this end, two datasets were analysed, one including five P. ebneri mitogenomes and the other additionally possessing a mitogenome of P. venosus (Fischer von Waldheim, 1839). Results showed that the mitogenome of P. ebneri consists of 37 genes and an AT-rich region, ordering as in Pancrustacean, constituting 15645-15668 base pairs. Among 38 gene borders, eight had intergenic sequences (IGS) and seven overlapping (OR). All tRNAs exhibited the typical clover-leaf structure except for trnS1. Pairwise distance ranges between 0.001-0.003 among sequences of P. ebneri and {\textasciitilde}0.12 between P. ebneri and P. venosus. The dN/dS and neutrality index indicated purifying selection in PCGs. We arrived at the following conclusions: (i) P. ebneri mitogenomes show characteristics of Orthoptera and Pancrustacea, (ii) IGS and OR appear conserved in Tettigoniidae, (iii) low intraspecific variation is likely due to small population size, and (iv) most of the PCGs evolved under purifying selection suggesting no specific adaptation to montane habitats.},

 abstract = {Parsley is a commonly cultivated Apiaceae species of culinary and medicinal importance. Parsley has several recognized health benefits and the species has been utilized in traditional medicine since ancient times. Although parsley is among the most commonly cultivated members of Apiaceae, no systematic genomic research has been conducted on parsley. In the present work, parsley genome was sequenced using the long-read HiFi (high fidelity) sequencing technology and a draft contig assembly of 1.57 Gb that represents 80.9\% of the estimated genome size was produced. The assembly was highly repeat-rich with a repetitive DNA content of 81\%. The assembly was phased into a primary and alternate assembly in order to minimize redundant contigs. Scaffolds were constructed with the primary assembly contigs, which were used for the identification of AMP (antimicrobial peptide) genes. Characteristic AMP domains and 3D structures were used to detect and verify antimicrobial peptides. As a result, 23 genes (PcAMP1-23) representing defensin, snakin, thionin, lipid transfer protein and vicilin-like AMP classes were identified. Bioinformatic analyses for the characterization of peptide physicochemical properties indicated that parsley AMPs are extracellular peptides, therefore, plausibly exert their antimicrobial effects through the most commonly described AMP action mechanism of membrane attack. AMPs are attracting increasing attention since they display their fast antimicrobial effects in small doses on both plant and animal pathogens with a significantly reduced risk of resistance development. Therefore, identification and characterization of AMPs is important for their incorporation into plant disease management protocols as well as medicinal research for the treatment of multi-drug resistant infections.},

 abstract = {Accurate decision making in precision oncology depends on integration of multimodal molecular information, for which various deep learning methods have been developed. However, most deep learning-based bulk multi-omics integration methods lack transparency, modularity, deployability, and are limited to narrow tasks. To address these limitations, we introduce Flexynesis, which streamlines data processing, feature selection, hyperparameter tuning, and marker discovery. Users can choose from deep learning architectures or classical supervised machine learning methods with a standardized input interface for single/multi-task training and evaluation for regression, classification, and survival modeling. We showcase the tool's capability across diverse use-cases in precision oncology. To maximize accessibility, Flexynesis is available on PyPi, Guix, Bioconda, and the Galaxy Server ( https://usegalaxy.eu/ ). This toolset makes deep-learning based bulk multi-omics data integration in clinical/pre-clinical research more accessible to users with or without deep-learning experience. Flexynesis is available at https://github.com/BIMSBbioinfo/flexynesis .},

Herein, we present the first transcriptomic datasets of three species of Opuntia. Comparative transcriptome profiling provides insights into the molecular and physiological functions between species and tissues. Total RNA from young cladodes and developing fruits of O. ficus-indica, O. robusta and O. joconostle was purified and sequenced by Massive Analysis of cDNA Ends technology, an RNA-seq variant. A total of 8383, 7890, and 5300 transcripts and GC content of 40.1, 39.9 and 40.1\% were obtained for the de novo assembly of O. ficus-indica, O. robusta and O. joconostle, respectively. For annotations, about 22.2–23.7\% of transcripts had matches in the UniProtKB/Swiss-Prot database. Moreover, the enriched 21 COG categories, 282 KEGG pathways and 2793 GO terms revealed that the transcriptomes obtained included functionally diverse genes in Opuntia. Differentially expressed transcripts (DETs) between fruit and cladode resulted in the enrichment of 13 significant KEGG pathways and 80 GO terms, where some genes viz. FULL, CYP75B1, and CMB1 were upregulated in the fruits of the three species. Between species, the most enriched GOs fell into the category of “Cellular Components”, which would explain the morphological and physiological differences between the three species. Moreover, DETs comparisons between fruit types and between cladodes were also reported. Overall, the transcriptomic data generated in this study provide the initial resources to understand the biology of Opuntia, offering new insight to understand its morphology, systematic and adaptation.},

 abstract = {Although Agave angustifolia Haw is one of the most cultural and industrial promising species in Mexico, no extensive genomic resources were available. Herein, we explore the transcriptome data set of this species. Total RNA from stem, roots, young and mature leaves was purified and sequenced by NovaSeq6000 system. From the de novo assembly of A. angustifolia, a total of 358,170 transcripts with average length of 1117 bp, N50 of 858 bp, and GC mean content of 43.5\% were obtained. About 48.7\% of the transcripts had open reading frame (ORF). Hence, 63.4\% and 42.7\% of the ORFs were annotated using Blastp and Blastx against UniProtKB database, respectively, uncovering the presence of at least 29,273 genes in the A. angustifolia transcriptome. The six pairwise comparisons between plant tissues resulted in the identification of 123,181 differentially expressed transcripts (23,978 were upregulated and 79,203 were downregulated). Several carbohydrate metabolism pathways were significantly enriched from the comparisons between leaves and stems. Thus, genes regulated for the fructan, starch and sucrose biosynthesis were discussed. Furthermore, genes involved in cellulose synthesis were explored being the members of the cellulose synthase genes subfamily were highly expressed in young leaf, while the members of the cellulose synthase-like subfamily were preferentially expressed in mature leaf. Moreover, A. angustifolia transcriptome served for the identification of 30,766 SSR and 21,686 VNTR potential markers. Overall, the transcriptomic data generated in this study provide an invaluable resource to understand the biology of A. angustifolia, offering new insight to understand their physiology and adaptation.},

 abstract = {\textit{Ciborinia camelliae} is the causal agent of camellia flower blight (CFB). It is a hemibiotrophic pathogen, inoperculate Discomycete of the family Sclerotiniaceae. It shows host and organ specificity infecting only flowers of species belonging to the genus \textit{Camellia}, causing serious damage to the ornamental component of the plant. In this work, the first mitochondrial genome of \textit{Ciborinia camellia} is reported. The mitogenome was obtained by combining Illumina short read and Nanopore long read technology. To resolve repetitive elements, specific primers were designed and used for Sanger sequencing. The manually curated mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) of the Italian strain DSM 112729 is a circular sequence of 114,660 bp, with 29.6\% of GC content. It contains two ribosomal RNA genes, 33 transfer RNAs, one RNase P gene, and 62 protein-coding genes. The latter include one gene coding for a ribosomal protein (\textit{rps3}) and the 14 typical proteins involved in the oxidative metabolism. Moreover, a partial mtDNA assembled from a contig list was obtained from the deposited genome assembly of a New Zealand strain of \textit{C. camelliae}. The present study contributes to understanding the mitogenome arrangement and the evolution of this phytopathogenic fungus in comparison to other Sclerotiniaceae species and confirms the usefulness of mitochondrial analysis to define phylogenetic positioning of this newly sequenced species.},

 abstract = {Heterotopic ossification (HO) occurs following mechanical trauma and burns, or congenitally in patients suffering from fibrodysplasia ossificans progressiva (FOP). Recently, we demonstrated that inhibitors of phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase alpha (PI3Kα) may be a useful therapy for patients undergoing HO. In this study, using the already marketed BYL719/Alpelisib/Piqray drug, we have further confirmed these results, detailed the underlying mechanisms of action, and optimized the timing of the administration of BYL719. We found that BYL719 effectively prevents HO even when administered up to 3–7 days after injury. We demonstrate in cell cultures and in a mouse model of HO that the major actions of BYL719 are on-target effects through the inhibition of PI3Kα, without directly affecting ACVR1 or FOP-inducing ACVR1R206H kinase activities. In vivo, we found that a lack of PI3Kα in progenitors at injury sites is sufficient to prevent HO. Moreover, time course assays in HO lesions demonstrate that BYL719 not only blocks osteochondroprogenitor specification but also reduces the inflammatory response. BYL719 inhibits the migration, proliferation, and expression of pro-inflammatory cytokines in monocytes and mast cells, suggesting that BYL719 hampers the hyper-inflammatory status of HO lesions. Altogether, these results highlight the potential of PI3Kα inhibition as a safe and effective therapeutic strategy for HO.},

Although lymphatic cells are in continuous contact with mesenchymal cells during development and in adult tissues, the role of mesenchymal cells in lymphatic vasculature development remains poorly characterized. Here, we show that a subpopulation of mesenchymal cells expressing the transcription factor Osr1 are in close association with migrating LECs and established lymphatic vessels in mice. Lineage tracing experiments revealed that Osr1+ cells precede LEC arrival during lymphatic vasculature assembly in the back of the embryo. Using Osr1-deficient embryos and functional in vitro assays, we show that Osr1 acts in a non-cell-autonomous manner controlling proliferation and early migration of LECs to peripheral tissues. Thereby, mesenchymal Osr1+ cells control, in a bimodal manner, the production of extracellular matrix scaffold components and signal ligands crucial for lymphatic vessel formation.},

@article{valsecchi_rna_2021,
 abstract = {Confinement of the X chromosome to a territory for dosage compensation is a prime example of how subnuclear compartmentalization is used to regulate transcription at the megabase scale. In Drosophila melanogaster, two sex-specific non-coding RNAs (roX1 and roX2) are transcribed from the X chromosome. They associate with the male-specific lethal (MSL) complex1, which acetylates histone H4 lysine 16 and thereby induces an approximately twofold increase in expression of male X-linked genes2,3. Current models suggest that X-over-autosome specificity is achieved by the recognition of cis-regulatory DNA high-affinity sites (HAS) by the MSL2 subunit4,5. However, HAS motifs are also found on autosomes, indicating that additional factors must stabilize the association of the MSL complex with the X chromosome. Here we show that the low-complexity C-terminal domain (CTD) of MSL2 renders its recruitment to the X chromosome sensitive to roX non-coding RNAs. roX non-coding RNAs and the MSL2 CTD form a stably condensed state, and functional analyses in Drosophila and mammalian cells show that their interactions are crucial for dosage compensation in vivo. Replacing the CTD of mammalian MSL2 with that from Drosophila and expressing roX in cis is sufficient to nucleate ectopic dosage compensation in mammalian cells. Thus, the condensing nature of roX–MSL2CTD is the primary determinant for specific compartmentalization of the X chromosome in Drosophila.},

We highlight the presence of structurally variable SVAs (SV-SVAs) in neurological disease-associated loci, and we further associate SV-SVAs to disease-associated SNPs and differential gene expression using luciferase assays and expression quantitative trait loci data.

Based on well-established workflows, we evaluate the effect of sample preparation, mass spectrometry, and bioinformatic analysis using two samples: a simplified, laboratory-assembled human intestinal model and a human fecal sample. We observe that variability at the peptide level is predominantly due to sample processing workflows, with a smaller contribution of bioinformatic pipelines. These peptide-level differences largely disappear at the protein group level. While differences are observed for predicted community composition, similar functional profiles are obtained across workflows. CAMPI demonstrates the robustness of present-day metaproteomics research, serves as a template for multi-laboratory studies in metaproteomics, and provides publicly available data sets for benchmarking future developments.},

Therefore, there is considerable interest in studying the epigenetic marks present at relevant chromosomal loci. Telomeric regions, which include telomeres and subtelomeres, have been traditionally considered heterochromatic. However, whereas the heterochromatic nature of subtelomeres has been widely accepted, the epigenetic status of telomeres remains controversial. Here, we studied the epigenetic features of Arabidopsis (Arabidopsis thaliana) telomeres by analyzing multiple genome-wide ChIP-seq experiments. Our analyses revealed that Arabidopsis telomeres are not significantly enriched either in euchromatic marks like H3K4me2, H3K9ac, and H3K27me3 or in heterochromatic marks such as H3K27me1 and H3K9me2. Thus, telomeric regions in Arabidopsis have a bimodal chromatin organization with telomeres lacking significant levels of canonical euchromatic and heterochromatic marks followed by heterochromatic subtelomeres. Since heterochromatin is known to influence telomere function, the heterochromatic modifications present at Arabidopsis subtelomeres could play a relevant role in telomere biology.},

While previous studies linked the phenotype to reduced ctnnb2 transcript levels, the causative mutation remained unidentified. Using long-read sequencing, we discovered that the ich phenotype stems from the insertion of a non-autonomous CMC-Enhancer/Suppressor-mutator (CMC-EnSpm) transposon in the 3’UTR of the gene. Through reporter assays, we demonstrate that while wild type ctnnb2 mRNAs exhibit remarkably high stability throughout the early stages of development, the insertion of the transposon dramatically reduces transcript stability. Genome-wide mapping of the CMC-EnSpm transposons across multiple zebrafish strains also indicated ongoing transposition activity in the zebrafish genome. Our findings not only resolve the molecular basis of the ich mutation but also highlight the continuing mutagenic potential of endogenous transposons and reveal unexpected aspects of maternal transcript regulation during early zebrafish development.},

Thanks to its ability to survive desiccation and freezing, this genus is usually recorded from harsh habitats such as exposed mosses and lichens and rock pools. In the last years, research focused on both describing Ramazzottius diversity and revealing the molecular mechanisms behind their cryptobiotic capabilities. Despite the research efforts in these fields, much still remains to be discovered. Here we describe a new Ramazzottius species from an Italian rock pool by means of integrative taxonomy (morphology, morphometry, and DNA sequencing) and sequenced its genome with Nanopore technology to provide an assembled mitogenome and annotate its Temperature and Desiccation Resistance Proteins (TDPR) repertoire. The new gonochoric species is phylogenetically close to the parthenogenetic R. varieornatus, a strain of which (YOKOZUNA-1) has been adopted as model organism for the study of cryptobiosis. The mitogenome of the new species shows perfect synteny with R. varieornatus and shares with it most of the TDPR genes. The relative genetic similarity of the new species to the model R. varieornatus, combined with unique biological traits (for example the difference in reproductive mode and the unique habitat it colonizes), makes the new species a potential new addition to the range of model tardigrade species.},

 abstract = {Blueberry cultivation has recently become a rapidly expanding export industry in Peru. With few to no official records of phytosanitary problems up to date. Nevertheless, as observed in other major blueberry producer countries, pests occurrences have been already reported. This study presents a comprehensive biological and molecular characterization of a novel blueberry pest, identifying it as a member of the Tortricidae family in the genus Platynota. The insect’s average life cycle was determined to be 46.3 days for males and 48.6 days for females, with the larval stage being the longest (25.4 days on average), and the most destructive due to its feeding behavior, which significantly damages buds and fruits. Morphological analysis of the genitalia, along with a comparison of its complete mitochondrial DNA, further supports the conclusion that this pest is a new species. These findings represent the first report of a tortricid pest affecting blueberries in Peru and offer crucial insights for developing effective pest management strategies, contributing to the sustainable growth of blueberry production and exports in the region.},

The aim of this study was to: 1) gain insight into the gene regulatory networks modulating leaf responses to polluted air, 2) identify possible changes in the leaf microbiome due to particulate matter in the real urban environment. The leaf transcriptome and microbiome were analyzed for Photinia x fraseri L. plants cultivated for three months in pots in two close-by areas under different levels of air PMs (low and high). PCA and heat map analysis showed that 28 differentially expressed genes in common between the three pairwise comparisons were able to clearly discriminate plants under higher PM levels. The pollutants were mainly sensed by plants through a restructuring modification of cell wall and membrane due to the main repression of lipid desaturases. In addition, high PMs showed a clear repression of genes belonging to primary metabolism pathways involved in C assimilation. Microbiome analysis showed no significant changes in taxonomic diversity indexes for the bacterial communities, whereas fungi belonging to the genera Epicoccum and Dioszegia were differently affected by the different exposure to PM levels. A model of transcriptional regulation to air PMs in plants has been proposed.},

 abstract = {In Drosophila, expression of eyeless (ey) gene is restricted to the developing eyes and central nervous system. However, the flanking genes, myoglianin (myo), and bent (bt) have different temporal and spatial expression patterns as compared to the ey. How distinct regulation of ey is maintained is mostly unknown. Earlier, we have identified a boundary element intervening myo and ey genes (ME boundary) that prevents the crosstalk between the cis-regulatory elements of myo and ey genes. In the present study, we further searched for the cis-elements that define the domain of ey and maintain its expression pattern. We identify another boundary element between ey and bt, the EB boundary. The EB boundary separates the regulatory landscapes of ey and bt genes. The two boundaries, ME and EB, show a long-range interaction as well as interact with the nuclear architecture. This suggests functional autonomy of the ey locus and its insulation from differentially regulated flanking regions. We also identify a new Polycomb Response Element, the ey-PRE, within the ey domain. The expression state of the ey gene, once established during early development is likely to be maintained with the help of ey-PRE. Our study proposes a general regulatory mechanism by which a gene can be maintained in a functionally independent chromatin domain in gene-rich euchromatin.},

@article{videm_chira_2021,
 abstract = {With the advances in next-generation sequencing technologies, it is possible to determine RNA-RNA interaction and RNA structure predictions on a genome-wide level. The reads from these experiments usually are chimeric, with each arm generated from one of the interaction partners. Owing to short read lengths, often these sequenced arms ambiguously map to multiple locations. Thus, inferring the origin of these can be quite complicated. Here we present ChiRA, a generic framework for sensitive annotation of these chimeric reads, which in turn can be used to predict the sequenced hybrids.Grouping reference loci on the basis of aligned common reads and quantification improved the handling of the multi-mapped reads in contrast to common strategies such as the selection of the longest hit or a random choice among all hits. On benchmark data ChiRA improved the number of correct alignments to the reference up to 3-fold. It is shown that the genes that belong to the common read loci share the same protein families or similar pathways. In published data, ChiRA could detect 3 times more new interactions compared to existing approaches. In addition, ChiRAViz can be used to visualize and filter large chimeric datasets intuitively.ChiRA tool suite provides a complete analysis and visualization framework along with ready-to-use Galaxy workflows and tutorials for RNA-RNA interactome and structurome datasets. Common read loci built by ChiRA can rescue multi-mapped reads on paralogous genes without requiring any information on gene relations. We showed that ChiRA is sensitive in detecting new RNA-RNA interactions from published RNA-RNA interactome datasets.},

Using cryo-EM, BDM91288 binding to the transmembrane region of K. pneumoniae AcrB was confirmed, further validating the mechanism of action of this inhibitor.

 abstract = {Until 2015, polymyxin resistance was primarily attributed to chromosomal mutations. However, with the first report of mobile colistin resistance (mcr-1) in commensal Escherichia coli from food animals in China, the landscape has changed. To evaluate the presence of polymyxin resistance in Salmonella spp., a drop screening test for colistin and polymyxin B was carried out on 1156 isolates of non-human origin (animals, food, and the environment), received in Brazil, between 2016 and 2021. Subsequently, 210 isolates with resistant results in the drop test were subjected to the gold-standard test (broth microdilution) for both colistin and polymyxin B. Whole-genome sequencing (WGS) of 102 resistant isolates was performed for a comprehensive analysis of associated genes. Surprisingly, none of the isolates resistant to colistin in the drop test harbored any of the mcr variants (mcr-1 to mcr-10). WGS identified that the most common mutations were found in pmrA (n= 22; T89S) and pmrB (n = 24; M15T, G73S, V74I, I83A, A111V). Other resistance determinants were also detected, such as the aac(6′)-Iaa gene in 72 isolates, while others carried beta-lactamase genes (blaTEM-1 blaCTX-M-2, blaCMY-2). Additionally, genes associated with fluoroquinolone resistance (qnrB19, qnrS1, oqxA/B) were detected in 11 isolates. Colistin and polymyxin B resistance were identified among Salmonella from non-human sources, but not associated with the mcr genes. Furthermore, the already-described mutations associated with polymyxin resistance were detected in only a small number of isolates, underscoring the need to explore and characterize unknown genes that contribute to resistance.},

 abstract = {The critically important YUCCA (YUC) gene family is highly conserved and specific to the plant kingdom, primarily responsible for the final and rate-limiting step for indole-3-acetic acid (IAA) biosynthesis. IAA is an essential phytohormone, involved in virtually all aspects of plant growth and development. In addition, IAA is involved in fine-tuning plant responses to biotic and abiotic interactions and stresses. While the YUC gene family has significantly expanded throughout the plant kingdom, a detailed analysis of the evolutionary patterns driving this diversification has not been performed. Here, we present a comprehensive phylogenetic analysis of the YUC family, combining YUCs from species representing key evolutionary plant lineages. The evolutionary history of YUCs is complex and suggests multiple recruitment events via horizontal gene transfer from bacteria. We identify and hierarchically classify the YUC family into an early diverging grade, five distinct classes and 41 subclasses. Angiosperm YUC diversity and expansion are explained in the context of protein sequence conservation, as well as spatial and gene expression patterns. The presented YUC gene landscape offers new perspectives on the distribution and evolutionary trends of this crucial family, which facilitates further YUC characterization within plant development and response to environmental change.},

Currently, many phytoplasma genomes have been reported in the literature. One of these corresponds to the draft genome of ‘Ca. P. palmae’, strain ACPD, which is associated with the Texas Phoenix Palm Decline phytoplasma and belongs to the 16SrIV-D subgroup. The genome of ‘Ca. P. palmae’, strain ACPD has been sequenced but not thoroughly analyzed. In this study, we present the draft genome of ‘Ca. P. palmae’-LY-C2, which belongs to the 16SrIV-A subgroup. It consists of 49 scaffolds, totaling 434,453 bp in length, and contains 412 coding-genes, with 365 of them being protein-coding genes. Fifty-four effectors were predicted, 24 of which are unique to this phytoplasma and 11 share homology with effectors of the Texas Phoenix Palm Decline phytoplasma. Some effectors have protein motifs in common with those of other phytoplasmas, but five new protein motifs exclusive to ‘Ca. P. palmae’-LY-C2 were identified. This study also highlights similarities and differences between ‘Ca. P. palmae’-LY-C2 and other phytoplasmas, including ‘Ca. P. palmae’ ACPD, providing new insights into this pathogen. The availability of these draft genomes lay the groundwork for further research on the pathogenic mechanisms and evolution of ‘Ca. P. palmae’.},

 abstract = {Pervasive transcription originating from the ubiquitous activity of RNA Polymerase II (RNAPII) generates a vast mass of non-coding RNAs (ncRNAs) that represent a potential harm to gene expression. In the compact genome of the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae, the main genomewide safeguard against pervasive ncRNAs is the Nrd1-Nab3-Sen1 (NNS) complex, composed of two RNA-binding proteins (Nrd1 and Nab3) and the helicase Sen1. The NNS complex directs transcription termination of ncRNA genes and promotes the rapid degradation of pervasive transcripts from yeast nuclei through its physical and functional coupling to the nuclear RNA exosome. We have recently shown that inhibition of the exosome in yeast cells leads to the accumulation of ncRNAs complexed with Nab3 and Nrd1, decreasing recycling of these termination factors to sites of transcription and inducing global termination defects at NNS targets. Consistent with the notion that ncRNAs out-titrate Nab3 and Nrd1 termination factors, we have shown that a similar genomewide termination impairment could be achieved by expressing a circular RNA decoy containing a Nab3 binding target [1]. In relation to this previous research article, here we expand our observations on the effect of the circular RNA decoy on NNS termination. We aimed at verifying that the Nab3 binding sequence present on the decoy is indeed efficiently sequestering Nab3 as intended by design, leading to the expected decrease of Nab3 binding on NNS targets. We employed the crosslinking and cDNA analysis protocol (CRAC) on yeast cells expressing the circular ncRNA decoy or a control construct. We present data from high-resolution genomewide RNA binding of Nab3 in three independent biological replicates of these S.cerevisiae cells, normalized by spiked-in S.pombe lysates. These data allow the useful assessment of the extent of co-transcriptional binding decrease of Nab3 by decoy ncRNA titration and will be valuable for further analyses of NNS targeting mechanisms.},

 abstract = {A large share of the non-coding transcriptome in yeast is controlled by the Nrd1-Nab3-Sen1 (NNS) complex, which promotes transcription termination of non-coding RNA (ncRNA) genes, and by the nuclear exosome, which limits the steady-state levels of the transcripts produced. How unconstrained ncRNA levels affect RNA metabolism and gene expression are long-standing and important questions. Here, we show that degradation of ncRNAs by the exosome is required for freeing Nrd1 and Nab3 from the released transcript after termination. In exosome mutants, these factors are sequestered by ncRNAs and cannot be efficiently recycled to sites of transcription, inducing termination defects at NNS targets. ncRNA-dependent, genome-wide termination defects can be recapitulated by the expression of a degradation-resistant, circular RNA containing a natural NNS target in exosome-proficient cells. Our results have important implications for the mechanism of termination, the general impact of ncRNAs abundance, and the importance of nuclear ncRNA degradation.},

 abstract = {The sweet chestnut (Castanea sativa Mill.) is one of the most widespread cultivated temperate trees in Europe, valued both for its edible nuts and high-quality timber. Due to its ecological, economic, and cultural importance, it has been the focus of extensive genetic studies. However, its mitochondrial genome has remained largely unexplored. Here, we present the first complete mitochondrial genome of C. sativa (cultivar ‘Marrone di Chiusa Pesio’), assembled using high-throughput sequencing and characterised through comparative analyses with closely related species. The final assembly consists of six contigs with a total length of 402,729 bp, comprising 35 protein-coding genes, 33 tRNA genes, and 3 rRNA genes. Compared to the congeneric C. mollissima, C. sativa shows a relatively low repeat content in terms of both number and length. Codon usage patterns were found to be highly similar among C. sativa, C. mollissima, and C. henryi. Additionally, homologous fragments between the plastid and mitochondrial genomes were identified, totaling 4,671 bp (1.16\% of the mitogenome), and including several tRNA genes. A phylogenetic analysis based on mitochondrial coding sequences from C. sativa and 11 other Fagaceae species confirmed its close relationship with C. mollissima, C. henryi, and Castanopsis carlesii. Discrepancies observed among mitochondrial, plastid, and nuclear gene trees likely reflect either inherent genomic characteristics or extensive hybridisation, particularly within the genus Quercus.},

@article{virgili_paedomorphic_2025,
 abstract = {Inhabiting soft substrates presents complex challenges for some groups of sessile filter feeders. Among these, ascidians have independently evolved traits and strategies to live in such habitats. Paedomorphosis, the retention of juvenile features of the ancestor into the adult stage, has been associated with taxa living freely within the sediment, including species of the pyurid genus Heterostigma Ärnbäck-Christie-Linde, 1924 (Ascidiacea: Stolidobranchia: Pyuridae). These poorly known solitary ascidians display peculiar morphological adaptations deemed for an interstitial lifestyle, although complete knowledge of their biology is still lacking. We hereby describe Heterostigma monniotae sp. nov., a new pyurid species from the littoral soft bottoms of Napoli (central Tyrrhenian Sea, Mediterranean Sea). An updated taxonomic table, built on the literature and the screening of types and unpublished material, clarified differences within the known species of the genus. Multilocus phylogenetic analyses based on single genes and the complete mitochondrial genome of the new species provided the first molecular information on this group and resolved its position as sister to the other Stolidobranchia. Finally, morphological and behavioural acquired adaptations were observed in live specimens of H. monniotae, revealing the shift from a sessile to a paedomorphic motile phenotype in mature specimens. This adaptive strategy was never documented before in sessile ascidians, appearing as an extreme strategy to survive in unstable habitats, although its inducing factors are still unclear. The motility of adults was filmed here for the first time. These findings challenge previous assumptions of these species’ lifestyle and behaviour, contributing to the understanding of the development and ecology of this group of sand-living ascidians. Finally, the comparison with closely related species highlighted how ontogenetic processes may have contributed to the radiation of sand-living tunicates.

Endophytes may contribute to the yield and composition of EOs, representing a useful tool for biotechnological applications. In this work, we investigated the genomic basis of this potential contribution. The annotated genomes of four endophytic strains isolated from Origanum vulgare L. were used to obtain KEGG ortholog codes, which were used for the annotation of different pathways in KEGG, and to evaluate whether endophytes might harbor the (complete) gene sets for terpene and/or plant hormone biosynthesis. All strains possessed ortholog genes for the mevalonate-independent pathway (MEP/DOXP), allowing for the production of isopentenyl diphosphate (IPP) and dimethylallyl diphosphate (DMAPP) precursors. Ortholog genes for the next steps in terpenoid biosynthesis were scarce. All the strains possess potential plant growth promotion (PGP) ability, as shown by the presence of orthologous genes involved in the biosynthesis of indoleacetic acid. The main contribution of endophytes to the yield and composition of O. vulgare EO very likely resides in their PGP activities and in the biosynthesis of precursors of bioactive compounds.},

@article{viushkov_influence_2025,
 abstract = {Cohesin organizes the genome into spatially segregated loops and topologically associated domains by loop extrusion. In addition, it ensures cohesion of sister chromatids after replication. Thus, cohesin is expected to limit chromatin dynamics by ensuring cohesion and compacting chromatin in the interphase. Nonetheless, loop extrusion is an example of chromatin dynamics; thus, cohesin could promote the dynamics of genomic loci at the scale of individual loops and contact domains. Moreover, given that the extruding activity of cohesin after replication is supplemented by its cohesive activity, the impact of cohesin on chromatin dynamics in different phases of the cell cycle may vary. Of particular interest is the cohesin’s role in the regulation of the dynamics of damaged chromatin, which remains insufficiently studied. Here, we visualized a genomic locus using the CRISPR-Sirius system in human cells with auxin-induced depletion of the cohesin subunit RAD21. Cohesin depletion increased the local spatial dynamics of the visualized locus on a time scale of fractions of a second to one minute. This effect was observed in both replicated and unreplicated chromatin. However, the increase in the mobility of the visualized locus upon cohesin depletion was more pronounced in the former. In addition, we showed that cohesin depletion did not affect the local mobility of double-strand break repair foci visualized using a fluorescent fragment of the repair factor 53BP1. Cohesin depletion did not affect the local mobility of repair foci in either replicated or unreplicated chromatin. The results indicate that cohesin constrains local spatial dynamics of genomic loci. At the same time, cohesive activity of cohesin is not indispensable for restricting chromatin dynamics, although it enhances the confinement effect. On the other hand, repair foci are less mobile structures than point chromatin loci, and cohesin does not affect their dynamics on the studied time scales.},

@techreport{voelker_terpene_2023,
 abstract = {In this thesis, comparative genomics was used to demonstrate that geographically-arranged, discrete terpenoid chemotypes in Melaleuca alternifolia (tea tree) are determined by a supergene comprising tightly clustered terpinene synthase (TPS) loci.  Supergenes are a set of linked genes that are inherited together as a single locus to affect a complex phenotype. They are generally thought to be adaptive and to associate with regions of suppressed recombination due to genome structural variations. The concept of a supergene has been around since the Modern Synthesis, in the early twentieth century, but many questions remain as to their evolutionary significance in adaptation and speciation, and how their genetic architecture and origins contribute to the geographic structure of complex phenotypes in natural populations. {\textless}br{\textgreater} {\textless}br{\textgreater}Tea tree is an ideal model to study terpenoid genetics within the family of Myrtaceae due to the deep understanding of terpenoid biochemistry, genomic tools and population resources accumulated over the more than 30 years it has been used as a plantation crop for essential oil production in Australia. Tea tree has six recognised chemotypes that are defined by the foliar concentrations of the three key monoterpenoids terpinen-4-ol, 1,8-cineole and terpinolene, but only the high terpinen-4-ol chemotype is grown commercially for its medicinal properties. Chemotypes in natural populations have a distinct geographic arrangement in upland and coastal regions. An adaptive role for chemotypes remains unclear, although recent studies showed a correlation of host preference by insects with terpenoid chemistry. The fundamental steps of terpenoid biosynthesis are well understood, and some TPS and other key enzymes have been identified and characterised in tea tree. Many plants encode a vast array of TPS, each catalysing the synthesis of one or more terpenoid constituents, with some species from the related genus Eucalyptus possessing the largest TPS gene families known in plants. Genome studies have shown that these TPS tend to be organised into gene clusters, due to an evolutionary process involving tandem duplication and subsequent functional specialisation. The resultant gene organisation makes TPS clusters prime candidates for supergene formation. {\textless}br{\textgreater} {\textless}br{\textgreater}Long-read genome sequencing was carried out to provide a foundation for reliable gene discovery, and study of genomic organisation in tea tree. A draft genome of 362 Mb size was assembled that exceeded the quality (N50 = 1.9 Mb) of any previously available sequence for the taxon. A total of 58 putatively functional full-length TPS genes, and 21 pseudogenes were identified and manually annotated. As in other Myrtaceae, TPS genes tended to occur in tandem arrays. The largest cluster of 13 TPS was located within 400 kb on a single scaffold of 731 kb length. This cluster included four TPS that encoded a sabinene hydrate synthase, producing the precursor of terpinen-4-ol, one terpinolene synthase, and two 1,8-cineole synthases. The observation of a tight clustering of four structural genes, previously shown to influence the levels of the key monoterpenoids defining chemotypes in tea tree, satisfied the first part of the supergene concept. {\textless}br{\textgreater} {\textless}br{\textgreater}A genome-wide association study (GWAS) was then used to associate marker genotypes with terpenoid chemotypes in tea tree. A set of 148 geographically diverse individuals spanning the upland and coastal ecotypes, and all of the six known chemotypes, were selected for genotyping, and approximately 22,000 single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) were identified. The GWAS found SNPs significantly associated with variations in 1,8-cineole, terpinen-4-ol, and terpinolene concentrations. Large proportions of their variation were explained by five SNPs near the previously identified TPS cluster, with some individual SNPs explaining 19-30\% of phenotypic variance. Closer examination uncovered the presence of chemotype-dependent null alleles at a further three SNPs located within the TPS cluster, suggesting one or more structural variants in this region, which may contribute to reduced recombination, and thus provides a possible basis for the strong linkage disequilibrium observed on this scaffold. Confirmation of SNP allele associations with terpenoid phenotypes was found in a separate domesticated population subject to artificial selection for a single chemotype, where all SNP alleles surrounding the TPS cluster were fixed.  {\textless}br{\textgreater} {\textless}br{\textgreater}These observations strongly suggest a supergene, where multiple physically proximal TPS genes behaving as a single linkage block account for the discrete chemotypes in tea tree. TPS supergenes are likely facilitated by tandem duplication and subsequent specialisation, leading to gene clusters with related functionality. Multiple adaptive alleles at neighbouring loci could then be captured as haplotypes, if structural variation arises that impedes recombination between TPS in this region. The shared biochemical origins of the terpenoid components and their interdependence are likely key to the concerted changes in discrete chemotypes and this mode of supergene evolution. Such supergenes, where relatively few alleles from several TPS loci are tied together in a limited number of haplotype blocks, may allow concerted, saltatory changes in complex terpenoid phenotypes in tea tree and other plants. This thesis argues that a genetic model with three haplotypes, encompassing the four characterised TPS genes, and invoking substrate competition for a common precursor, could account for all six chemotypes in M. alternifolia, and is consistent with the available bi-parental cross segregation data.},

They are encoded by a highly diverse gene family believed to evolve by tandem duplication in response to adaptive pressures.

In this study, comparative analysis of Melaleuca alternifolia (tea tree), from the related tribe Melaleuceae, revealed some Myrtaceae have smaller TPS families, as a total of 58 putatively functional full-length TPS genes, and 21 pseudogenes were identified by manual annotation of a newly released long-read assembly of the genome. The TPS-a and TPS-b2 subfamilies that synthesise secondary compounds often mediating plant-environment interactions were more diminutive than those in eucalypts, probably reflecting key differences in the evolutionary histories of the two lineages. Of the putatively functional TPS-b1, 13 clustered into a region of around 400 kb on one scaffold. The organisation of these TPS suggested that tandem duplication was instrumental in the evolution and diversity of terpene chemistry in Melaleuca. Four TPS-b1 likely to catalyse the synthesis of the three monoterpenoid components that are used to classify tea tree chemotypes were encoded within a single small region of 87 kb in the larger cluster of TPS-b1, raising the possibility that coregulation and linkage may lead to their behaviour as a single locus, providing an explanation for the categorical inheritance of complex multiple-component chemotypes in the taxon.},

As the oldest extant phylum with mineralized structures, sponges are key to understanding animal biomineralization. Yet, the biomineralization process in sponges, particularly in forming spicules, is not well understood. To address this, we conducted transcriptomic, genomic, and proteomic analyses on the calcareous sponge \textit{Sycon ciliatum}, supplemented by \textit{in situ} hybridization. We identified 829 genes overexpressed in regions of increased calcite spicule formation, including 17 calcarins-proteins analogous to corals' galaxins localized in the spicule matrix and expressed in sclerocytes. Their expression varied temporally and spatially, specific to certain spicule types, indicating that fine-tuned gene regulation is crucial for biomineralization control. Similar subtle expression changes are also relevant in stony coral biomineralization. Tandem gene arrangements and expression changes suggest that gene duplication and neofunctionalization have significantly shaped \textit{S. ciliatum}'s biomineralization, similar to that in corals. These findings suggest a parallel evolution of carbonate biomineralization in the calcitic \textit{S. ciliatum} and aragonitic corals, exemplifying the evolution of mechanisms crucial for animals to act as ecosystem engineers and form reef structures.},

The study presents a comprehensive multi-omics analysis of the impact of ionising radiation (IR) on barley seedlings, intending to identify candidate pathways for creating radiation-resilient barley plants. We found that different IR treatments (gamma, electron, proton, neutron) increased the intensity of protein catabolism and led to the attenuation of translation. The impact of IRs on protein synthesis and degradation was accompanied by rearrangements in energy metabolism and reallocation of nitrogen, probably due to enhanced protein catabolism. At least partially, those changes seem to fuel secondary metabolites production, including riboflavin, various phytoalexins, phytosiderophores, ferulic and sinapic acids, kaempferol, quercetin, nictoflorin, gallate, and podophyllotoxin. Many of these compounds have antioxidant or radioprotective properties. To focus on possible targets for gene editing, we identified genes differentially regulated after all types of IR exposure and potential transcription factors regulating secondary metabolism, including AP2/ERF, WRKY, bHLH, bZIP, MYB, and NAC families.},

Atherosclerosis, driven by inflammation, is a leading cause of cardiovascular events. Recent clinical trials have highlighted the therapeutic potential of anti-inflammatory treatments. Consequently, colchicine is being recommended for secondary prevention in current guidelines, although the drug's mechanistic actions are not fully understood.
Methods
To this end, we conducted a multiomic investigation of colchicine's effect on human carotid plaques. Sections from endarterectomy specimens were exposed to colchicine at concentrations of 2 ng/ml and 10 ng/ml ex vivo for 24 h and compared to untreated segments of the same plaque. Gene expression changes were analyzed by bulk RNA sequencing, and plaque secretomes underwent mass spectrometry for proteomic analysis. In situ cell proliferation was assessed by histology.
Results
Our data indicate, that colchicine suppresses neutrophil and platelet degranulation and activation, collagen degradation and atheromatous plaque macrophage proliferation in a dose-dependent manner in human plaques, while stimulating myofibroblast activation. Unexpectedly, interleukine (IL)-1beta release from colchicine treated plaques was not reduced. These results indicate that the inflammasome may not be the predominant target of low-dose colchicine in human carotid artery plaques.
Conclusion
Our study identifies multifactorial pathways through which colchicine, the first cardiovascular guideline-recommended anti-inflammatory drug, predominantly acts on human atherosclerotic lesions beyond the inflammasome. Targeting neutrophil and platelet degranulation, collagen degradation and macrophage proliferation, selectively, may provide substantial therapeutic benefit in atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease without colchicine's undesired side effects.},

 abstract = {Abstract

Insulator-binding proteins (IBPs) play a critical role in genome architecture by forming and maintaining contact domains. While the involvement of several IBPs in organising chromatin architecture in
Drosophila
has been described, the specific contribution of the Suppressor of Hairy wings (Su(Hw)) IBP to genome topology remains unclear. In this study, we provide evidence for the existence of long-range interactions (LRIs) between Su(Hw) and Combgap ChIP-Seq peaks, reflected in the indirect binding of these proteins to chromatin in ChIP experiments. Loss of Su(Hw) binding results in the disappearance of Su(Hw)-Combgap LRIs and a decrease in spatial self-interactions among a subset of Su(Hw) sites. Our findings suggest that Su(Hw)-Combgap LRIs are associated with active chromatin rather than Polycomb-directed repression. Furthermore, we observe that the majority of transcription start sites that are down-regulated upon loss of Su(Hw) binding to chromatin are located within 2 kb of Combgap peaks and exhibit Su(Hw)-dependent changes in Combgap and transcriptional regulators’ binding.},

The present work evaluates for the first time, the impact of secondary pions on central nervous system functionality. The fractional pion dose emanating from thicker shielded spacecraft regions could contribute up to 10\% of the total absorbed radiation dose. New results from the Paul Scherrer Institute have revealed that low dose exposures to 150 MeV positive and negative pions, akin to a Mars mission, result in significant, long-lasting cognitive impairments.

 abstract = {The severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) has a persistent negative impact on both the public health and the global economy. To comprehend the origin, transmission routes and discover the mutations that alter the virus’s transmissibility and pathogenicity, full-length SARS-CoV-2 genomes have to be molecularly characterized. Focusing on a two-year time frame (2020-2021), we provide an in-depth virologic and epidemiological overview of the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic in the Republic of North Macedonia by assessing the frequency and distribution of the circulating SARS-CoV-2 variants. Using genetic characterization and phylogenetic analysis we shed light on the molecular evolution of the virus as well as test for a possible connection between specific SARS-CoV-2 haplotypes and the severity of the clinical symptoms. Our results show that one fifth (21.51\%) of the tested respiratory samples for SARS-CoV-2 were positive. A noticeable trend in the incidence and severity of the COVID-19 infections was observed in the 60+ age group between males and females. Of the total number of positive cases, the highest incidence of SARS-CoV-2 was noticed in 60+ males (4,170.4/100,000), with a statistically significant (0,0001) difference between the two sexes. Additionally, a 1.8x increase in male mortality and consequentially significantly higher number of death cases was observed compared to females of the same age group (0.001). A total of 327 samples were sequenced in the period March 2020 - August 2021, showing the temporal distribution of SARS-CoV-2 variants circulating in North Macedonia. The phylogenetic analysis showed that most of the viral genomes were closely related and clustered in four distinctive lineages, B.1, B.1.1.7, B.1.351 and B.1.617.2. A statistically significant difference was observed in the 2C\_1 haplotype (p=0.0013), where 10.5\% of the patients were hospitalized due to severe clinical condition. By employing genetic sequencing, coupled with epidemiological investigations, we investigated viral distribution patterns, identified emerging variants and detected vaccine breakthrough infections. The present work is the first molecular study giving a comprehensive overview of the genetic landscape of circulating SARS-CoV-2 viruses in North Macedonia in a period of two years.},

It is a common cause of nosocomial infections, and is particularly troublesome due to extensive intrinsic and acquired antimicrobial resistance. Using experimental evolution, we generated Drosophila -adapted E. faecalis strains, which exhibited immune resistance, resulting in increased in vivo growth and virulence. Resistance was characterised by mutations in bacterial pathways responsive to cell envelope stress. Drosophila -adapted strains exhibited changes in sensitivity to relevant antimicrobials, including daptomycin and vancomycin. Evolved daptomycin-resistant strains harboured mutations in the same signalling systems, with some strains showing increased virulence similar to Drosophila -adapted strains.

 abstract = {Enterococcus faecalis is a Gram-positive bacterium found in the normal gut microbiota of diverse species, including vertebrates and invertebrates, as well as being common in the environment. It is also an opportunistic pathogen with a broad host range. One of the hosts E. faecalis can infect is the fruit fly, Drosophila melanogaster. The Drosophila immune response is distinct from that of humans and interacts with E. faecalis differently. To study this interaction we carried out experimental evolution via serial passage of E. faecalis in Drosophila. We generated E. faecalis strains with much-enhanced ability to survive and proliferate within this host. Strains selected in this way are specifically resistant to the Toll-induced Bomanin family of effector peptides, resulting not only in higher E. faecalis numbers but also in a significant increase in pathogenicity. Many of these Drosophila-selected strains also exhibit marked increases or decreases in antimicrobial resistance. Whole genome sequencing showed that most selected strains carried single mutations and that many of these mutations were in genes encoding proteins known to be involved in bacterial surface characteristics and antimicrobial resistance (mprF\_2, liaF, yxdM, croS, bgsA). To test if Drosophila antimicrobial peptides kill E. faecalis using mechanisms similar to antibiotics we generated E. faecalis strains that were resistant to daptomycin. Some of these daptomycin-adapted strains also acquired resistance to the Drosophila immune response. Daptomycin-adapted E. faecalis strains have mutations in the same genes or the same regulatory systems as were observed in Drosophila-adapted strains. As common genetic mechanisms underlie the resistance of E. faecalis to daptomycin and the Drosophila immune response, these results indicate these two systems target the same conserved bacterial properties in E. faecalis. They also demonstrate that the selection and emergence of antibiotic resistance in vivo does not require antibiotic exposure.},

@article{wambreuse_carotenoid-based_2025,
 abstract = {Sea cucumbers are marine deuterostomes possessing a complex innate immune system composed of a wide diversity of immune cells—coelomocytes—making them compelling models for exploring the evolution of immunity. This study investigates the functional specialisation of coelomocytes within the two main echinoderm body fluids, namely, the perivisceral fluid (PF) from the perivisceral cavity and the hydrovascular fluid (HF) from the hydrovascular–ambulacral system. Given their distribution restricted to the HF, haemocyte-like cells (HELs) are particularly investigated. In echinoderms, haemocytes have been described as reddish cells containing haemoglobin and thus presenting a function in oxygen transport. Using an integrative approach that combines cell morphological analyses, pigment profiling, and multi-omics technologies, we demonstrate in the sea cucumber Holothuria forskali that HELs harbour exceptionally high concentrations of carotenoids, primarily canthaxanthin and astaxanthin, potent antioxidant molecules responsible for their pigmentation. Transcriptomics and proteomics analyses reveal that HELs express candidate genes involved in the carotenoid metabolism pathway as well as catalase, an antioxidant enzyme. Additionally, spectral flow cytometry assays reveal that HELs do not produce reactive oxygen species (ROS) in contrast to most coelomocyte types, reinforcing the hypothesis of their antioxidant function. HELs also contribute to the formation of large red bodies (i.e., coelomocyte aggregates) and increase in concentration following lipopolysaccharide injections, indicating an active role in immunity. Given these results, we hypothesise that these cells act after the culmination of the immune response, forming an antioxidant shell around the cellular aggregates to mitigate oxidative stress from ROS produced while encapsulating pathogens, thus protecting the host tissues. The discovery of carotenoid-carrying coelomocytes constitutes the first report of pigmented coelomocytes in sea cucumbers (except respiratory pigments), challenging the long-standing assumption that these cells contain haemoglobin. Therefore, we propose renaming haemocytes into carotenocytes, at least in this species. However, we believe that this newly described coelomocyte type has been misidentified as haemoglobin-containing cells in many previous studies and may be present in many other holothuroid species. Our findings thus establish a new paradigm in the study of coelomocytes in echinoderms, as well as in the function of the hydrovascular system, which is unique to this phylum.},

 abstract = {VEZF1 is a highly conserved vertebrate transcription factor that has ubiquitous expression in vertebrates. VEZF1 is essential for the barrier activity of the chicken ẞ globin HS4 insulator, where it prevents de novo DNA methylation. Knock-out of VEZF1 results in lethal haemorrhaging and edema in murine embryos, indicating a role for VEZF1 in the maintenance of vascular integrity.

In this study, the CUT\&Tag method, previously reported to be an improvement on CUT\&RUN and ChIP-seq, was utilised to map VEZF1 binding sites in K562 cells. The binding sites identified by CUT\&Tag are similar to those previously identified using ChIP-seq, but the data generated from CUT\&Tag shows significant advantages of lower background and higher peaks. Peak analysis indicates that most of the VEZF1 peaks are associated with promoters or enhancers, and there is strong co-localisation of the binding of VEZF1 and GATA2. VEZF1 tends to recognize and bind to GGGNGGGG motifs, but no difference is found between GGGNGGGG motifs discovered at VEZF1-associated promoters and enhancers. Furthermore, co-localisation of GATA2 does not affect the sequence of the GGGGNGGGG motifs enriched at VEZF1 peaks. Sequence analysis also revealed other motifs that are recognized by a variety of transcription factors, which may act alongside VEZF1 to regulate gene expression in K562 cells. 

Our study shows that CUT\&Tag is an efficient method for mapping and analyzing the binding sites of transcription factors, and provides new opportunities for research on the interactions between VEZF1 and other transcription factors.},

Here, we report the most compelling case to date: a tidal disruption event (TDE) exhibiting unprecedented 19.6-day quasi-periodic variations in both x-rays and radio, with x-ray amplitudes exceeding an order of magnitude. The nearly synchronized x-ray and radio variations suggest a shared mechanism regulating the emission regions. We demonstrate that a disk-jet Lense-Thirring precession model successfully reproduces these variations while requiring a low-spin black hole. This study uncovers previously uncharted short-term radio variability in TDEs, highlights the transformative potential of high-cadence radio monitoring, and offers profound insights into disk-jet physics.},

By comparing with other published Acroneuriinae mitogenomes, we found that minimal length variation in protein-coding genes (PCGs), transfer RNA genes (tRNAs), and ribosomal RNA genes (rRNAs), whereas the control region (CR) exhibits considerable length divergence. Meanwhile, the mitogenome of Acroneuriinae species is relatively conserved in nucleotide composition and codon usage.

We also identified gene rearrangement in these two mitogenomes, representing the first report of such events in the order Plecoptera. Phylogenetic results support the monophyly of the tribes Claasseniini, Neoperlini, and Kiotinini, as well as the subfamily Perlinae. Trees from the PCG and PCG12 datasets exhibited more congruent and well accepted topologies.

Advances in DNA-sequencing technologies have not only reduced the cost of sequencing but, with the advent of highly accurate long-read methods, have also enabled facile genome assembly even using mixed genomic input, thereby allowing us to more easily assess the contribution of symbionts to their insect hosts. In this study, genomic data recently generated from Peregrinus maidis was used to assemble the genome of a bacterial symbiont, Pm Arsenophonus sp. This {\textasciitilde}4.9-Mb assembly is one of the largest Arsenophonus genomes reported to date. The Benchmarking Universal Single-Copy Orthologs (BUSCO) result indicates that this Pm Arsenophonus assembly has a high degree of completeness, with 96\% of the single-copy Enterobacterales orthologs found. The identity of the Pm Arsenophonus sp. was further confirmed by phylogenetic analysis. Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) pathway analysis indicates a major contribution by Pm Arsenophonus sp. to the biosynthesis of B vitamins and essential amino acids in P. maidis, where threonine and lysine production is carried out solely by Pm Arsenophonus sp. This study not only provides deeper insights into the evolutionary relationships between symbionts and their insect hosts, but also adds to our understanding of insect biology, potentially guiding the development of novel pest control methods.},

 abstract = {The regulation of plant biomass degradation by fungi is critical to the carbon cycle, and applications in bioproducts and biocontrol. Trichoderma harzianum is an important plant biomass degrader, enzyme producer, and biocontrol agent, but few putative major transcriptional regulators have been deleted in this species. The T. harzianum ortholog of the transcriptional activator XYR1/XlnR/XLR-1 was deleted, and the mutant strains were analyzed through growth profiling, enzymatic activities, and transcriptomics on cellulose. From plate cultures, the Δxyr1 mutant had reduced growth on D-xylose, xylan, and cellulose, and from shake-flask cultures with cellulose, the Δxyr1 mutant had {\textasciitilde}90\% lower β-glucosidase activity, and no detectable β-xylosidase or cellulase activity. The comparison of the transcriptomes from 18 h shake-flask cultures on D-fructose, without a carbon source, and cellulose, showed major effects of XYR1 deletion whereby the Δxyr1 mutant on cellulose was transcriptionally most similar to the cultures without a carbon source. The cellulose induced 43 plant biomass-degrading CAZymes including xylanases as well as cellulases, and most of these had massively lower expression in the Δxyr1 mutant. The expression of a subset of carbon catabolic enzymes, other transcription factors, and sugar transporters was also lower in the Δxyr1 mutant on cellulose. In summary, T. harzianum XYR1 is the master regulator of cellulases and xylanases, as well as regulating carbon catabolic enzymes.},

 abstract = {Cell surface receptors such as integrins are repeatedly internalized from and recycled back to the plasma membrane before routed to lysosomes for degradation. In search for modulators of β1 integrin surface stability, we identified the Rab7 small GTPase, believed to be required for lysosome biogenesis, as integrin stabilizer. We show that Rab7 deficiency produces late endosomes and lysosomes with acidic pH, lysosome-specific proteins and membrane architectures that are functional in protein degradation and organelle fusion. Furthermore, Rab7-deficient lysosomes form from Rab4- and transferrin receptor-positive recycling endosomes, resulting in the degradation of proteins designated for recycling. Finally, we also found that overexpression of Rab4 can direct lysosome formation from recycling endosomes in absence as well as presence of Rab7, however, the latter to a much lesser extent. Our findings reveal a lysosome biogenesis and lysosomal protein degradation pathway that becomes dominant in absence of Rab7 or when Rab4 is highly abundant.},

 abstract = {Chemical modifications of transcripts with a 5′ cap occur in all organisms and function in many aspects of RNA metabolism. To facilitate analysis of RNA caps, we developed a systems-level mass spectrometry-based technique, CapQuant, for accurate and sensitive quantification of the cap epitranscriptome. The protocol includes the addition of stable isotope-labeled cap nucleotides (CNs) to RNA, enzymatic hydrolysis of endogenous RNA to release CNs, and off-line enrichment of CNs by ion-pairing high-pressure liquid chromatography, followed by a 17 min chromatography-coupled tandem quadrupole mass spectrometry run for the identification and quantification of individual CNs. The total time required for the protocol can be up to 7 d. In this approach, 26 CNs can be quantified in eukaryotic poly(A)-tailed RNA, bacterial total RNA and viral RNA. This protocol can be modified to analyze other types of RNA and RNA from in vitro sources. CapQuant stands out from other methods in terms of superior specificity, sensitivity and accuracy, and it is not limited to individual caps nor does it require radiolabeling. Thanks to its unique capability of accurately and sensitively quantifying RNA caps on a systems level, CapQuant can reveal both the RNA cap landscape and the transcription start site distribution of capped RNA in a broad range of settings.},

The cell cycle phase is a major contributor to gene expression variance between cells and computational analysis tools have been developed to assign cell cycle phases to cells within scRNAseq datasets. Whilst these tools can be extremely useful, all have the drawback that they classify cells as only G1, S or G2/M. Existing discrete cell phase assignment tools are unable to differentiate between G2 and M and continuous-phase-assignment tools are unable to identify a region corresponding specifically to mitosis in a pseudo-timeline for continuous assignment along the cell cycle. In this study, bulk RNA sequencing was used to identify differentially expressed genes between mitotic and interphase cells isolated based on phospho-histone H3 expression using fluorescence-activated cell sorting. These gene lists were used to develop a methodology which can distinguish G2 and M phase cells in scRNAseq datasets. The phase assignment tools present in Seurat were modified to allow for cell cycle phase assignment of all stages of the cell cycle to identify a mitotic-specific cell population.},

 abstract = {The lysine acetyltransferase KAT6A (MOZ, MYST3) belongs to the MYST family of chromatin regulators, facilitating histone acetylation. Dysregulation of KAT6A has been implicated in developmental syndromes and the onset of acute myeloid leukemia (AML). Previous work suggests that KAT6A is recruited to its genomic targets by a combinatorial function of histone binding PHD fingers, transcription factors and chromatin binding interaction partners. Here, we demonstrate that a winged helix (WH) domain at the very N-terminus of KAT6A specifically interacts with unmethylated CpG motifs. This DNA binding function leads to the association of KAT6A with unmethylated CpG islands (CGIs) genome-wide. Mutation of the essential amino acids for DNA binding completely abrogates the enrichment of KAT6A at CGIs. In contrast, deletion of a second WH domain or the histone tail binding PHD fingers only subtly influences the binding of KAT6A to CGIs. Overexpression of a KAT6A WH1 mutant has a dominant negative effect on H3K9 histone acetylation, which is comparable to the effects upon overexpression of a KAT6A HAT domain mutant. Taken together, our work revealed a previously unrecognized chromatin recruitment mechanism of KAT6A, offering a new perspective on the role of KAT6A in gene regulation and human diseases.},

 abstract = {Rett syndrome is a complex neurodevelopmental disorder that is mainly caused by mutations in MECP2. However, mutations in FOXG1 cause a less frequent form of atypical Rett syndrome, called FOXG1 syndrome. FOXG1 is a key transcription factor crucial for forebrain development, where it maintains the balance between progenitor proliferation and neuronal differentiation. Using genome-wide small RNA sequencing and quantitative proteomics, we identified that FOXG1 affects the biogenesis of miR200b/a/429 and interacts with the ATP-dependent RNA helicase, DDX5/p68. Both FOXG1 and DDX5 associate with the microprocessor complex, whereby DDX5 recruits FOXG1 to DROSHA. RNA-Seq analyses of Foxg1cre/+ hippocampi and N2a cells overexpressing miR200 family members identified cAMP-dependent protein kinase type II-beta regulatory subunit (PRKAR2B) as a target of miR200 in neural cells. PRKAR2B inhibits postsynaptic functions by attenuating protein kinase A (PKA) activity; thus, increased PRKAR2B levels may contribute to neuronal dysfunctions in FOXG1 syndrome. Our data suggest that FOXG1 regulates PRKAR2B expression both on transcriptional and posttranscriptional levels.},

The five-year survival rate for patients diagnosed with advanced stage oral cancer is 30\%. Hence, the identification of novel therapeutic targets is an urgent need. However, tumors are comprised of a heterogeneous collection of cells with distinct genetic and molecular profiles that can differentially promote metastasis making therapy development a challenging task. Here, we leveraged intratumoral heterogeneity in order to identify drivers of cancer cell motility that might be druggable targets for anti-metastasis therapy.{\textless}h4{\textgreater}Methods{\textless}/h4{\textgreater}We used 2D migration and 3D matrigel-based invasion assays to characterize the invasive heterogeneity among and within four human oral cancer cell lines in vitro. Subsequently, we applied mRNA-sequencing to map the transcriptomes of poorly and strongly invasive subclones as well as primary tumors and matched metastasis.{\textless}h4{\textgreater}Results{\textless}/h4{\textgreater}We identified SAS cells as a highly invasive oral cancer cell line. Clonal analysis of SAS yielded a panel of 20 subclones with different invasive capacities. Integrative gene expression analysis identified the Lymphocyte cell-specific protein-tyrosine kinase (LCK) as a druggable target gene associated with cancer cell invasion and metastasis. Inhibition of LCK using A-770041 or dasatinib blocked invasion of highly aggressive SAS cells. Interestingly, reduction of LCK activity increased the formation of adherens junctions and induced cell differentiation.{\textless}h4{\textgreater}Conclusion{\textless}/h4{\textgreater}Analysis of invasive heterogeneity led to the discovery of LCK as an important regulator of motility in oral cancer cells. Hence, small molecule mediated inhibition of LCK could be a promising anti-metastasis therapy option for oral cancer patients.},

BmNPV infects the larval stages of the silkworm Bombyx mori, causing fatal viral infection and preventing the larvae from reaching the pupal stage. Numerous BmNPV isolates have been described from silk producing countries from all over the world. In this study, the geographic distribution of BmNPV in Thailand was analyzed by collecting 18 samples from different regions. The BmNPV samples were analyzed by PCR and whole genome sequencing was performed for eight specimens. Their genome size ranged from 125,888 bp to 126,783 bp, comprising 138 open reading frames. Although the sequenced BmNPV genomes could be phylogenetically differentiated, a correlation between geographic and genetic distance was not observed indicating a close relationship between the BmNPV from Thailand.},

 abstract = {Prolonged manganese exposure causes manganism, a neurodegenerative movement disorder. The identity of adaptive and nonadaptive cellular processes targeted by manganese remains mostly unexplored. Here we study mechanisms engaged by manganese in genetic cellular models known to increase susceptibility to manganese exposure, the plasma membrane manganese efflux transporter SLC30A10 and the mitochondrial Parkinson's gene PARK2. We found that SLC30A10 and PARK2 mutations as well as manganese exposure compromised the mitochondrial RNA granule composition and function, resulting in disruption of mitochondrial transcript processing. These RNA granule defects led to impaired assembly and function of the mitochondrial respiratory chain. Notably, cells that survived a cytotoxic manganese challenge had impaired RNA granule function, thus suggesting that this granule phenotype was adaptive. CRISPR gene editing of subunits of the mitochondrial RNA granule, FASTKD2 or DHX30, as well as pharmacological inhibition of mitochondrial transcription-translation, were protective rather than deleterious for survival of cells acutely exposed to manganese. Similarly, adult \textit{Drosophila} mutants with defects in the mitochondrial RNA granule component \textit{scully} were safeguarded from manganese-induced mortality. We conclude that impairment of the mitochondrial RNA granule function is a protective mechanism for acute manganese toxicity.},

@article{werner_targeted_2023,
 abstract = {Pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) represents one of the most aggressive and lethal malignancies worldwide with an urgent need for new diagnostic and therapeutic strategies. One major risk factor for PDAC is the pre-indication of chronic pancreatitis (CP), which represents highly inflammatory pancreatic tissue. Kallikreins (KLKs) are secreted serine proteases that play an important role in various cancers as components of the tumor microenvironment. Previous studies of KLKs in solid tumors largely relied on either transcriptomics or immunodetection. We present one of the first targeted mass spectrometry profiling of kallikrein proteases in PDAC, CP, and normal pancreas. We show that KLK6 and KLK10 are significantly upregulated in PDAC (n=14) but not in CP (n=7) when compared to normal pancreas (n=16), highlighting their specific intertwining with malignancy. Additional explorative proteome profiling identified 5936 proteins in our pancreatic cohort and observed disease-specific proteome rearrangements in PDAC and CP. As such, PDAC features an enriched proteome motif for extracellular matrix (ECM) and cell adhesion while there is depletion of mitochondrial energy metabolism proteins, reminiscent of the Warburg effect. Although often regarded as a PDAC hallmark, the ECM fingerprint was also observed in CP, alongside with a prototypical inflammatory proteome motif as well as with an increased wound healing process and proteolytic activity, thereby possibly illustrating tissue autolysis. Proteogenomic analysis based on publicly accessible data sources identified 112 PDAC-specific and 32 CP-specific single amino acid variants, which among others affect KRAS and ANKHD1. Our study emphasizes the diagnostic potential of kallikreins and provides novel insights into proteomic characteristics of PDAC and CP.},

 abstract = {Clear cell renal cell carcinoma (ccRCC) is the most prevalent renal malignancy with a poor prognosis when metastasized. The invasive growth of cancer cells relates to membrane-damaging forces, but the relevance of plasma membrane repair machinery in ccRCC remains incompletely understood. Employing proteomics, analysis of scRNA-sequencing data, and multiplex imaging, we identified ANXA4 as selectively expressed in ccRCC, with distinct localization patterns at the plasma and nuclear membranes. Genetic titration studies demonstrated that reduced ANXA4 expression impairs membrane repair and invasive capabilities. Further segmentation analysis of ANXA4-low tumors showed a distinct composition of the tumor microenvironment, with increased tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes and acellular extracellular matrix deposition. Transcriptomic analysis demonstrated alterations in epithelial-mesenchymal transition and immune signaling signatures in ANXA4-low tumors. Transcription factor enrichment analysis identified ELF3 as a regulator of invasive properties. Our integrative approach uncovered multiple roles for ANXA4 in modulating membrane repair, transcriptional regulation, and shaping the ccRCC tumor microenvironment composition.},

In this study, we assessed the duration of rectal ESBL- producing E. coli colonisation in the residents, and compare duration of colonisation for ESBL-ST131 versus ESBL-non-ST131.MethodsRectal or faecal samples were obtained from residents of nursing home A between 2013 and 2019 and nursing home B between 2017 and 2019, with repeated point prevalence surveys at intervals of three to six months. Extended-spectrum β-lactamase (ESBL)-producing strains of E. coli were identified on selective culture and selective\&amp;nbsp;enrichment\&amp;nbsp;broth, and examined by antimicrobial susceptibility testing. In nursing home A multilocus sequence typing (MLST) and cluster analyse was performed by respectively O25:ST131-specific PCR and amplified fragment length polymorphism (AFLP). In nursing home B whole genome sequencing data were used to determine MLST and to perform a cluster analyse. Kaplan Meier survival analysis was performed to calculate the median time of rectal colonisation of ESBL-EC with a Log-Rank analysis to test for differences between ESBL-ST131 and ESBL-non-ST131.ResultsA total of 144 residents were included: 84 residents (58\%) with ESBL-ST131 rectal colonisation and 60 residents (42\%) with ESBL-non-ST131 rectal colonisation. Survival analysis showed a median colonisation length of 13 months for ESBL-ST131 (95\%CI: 7,2 – 18,7) versus 8,3 months (95\%CI: 2,8 – 13,8) for ESBL-non-ST131 (p = 0,028). Remarkably, in the subgroup ST131 the median colonisation length was significantly longer in female than in males: 25,7 months versus 8,1 months (p = 0,013).ConclusionHere we found a prolonged colonisation duration of ESBL-ST131 compared to ESBL-non-ST131 in residents of Dutch nursing homes. Prolonged colonisation duration complicates the controlling and ending an ESBL-ST131 outbreak, especially in long stay settings such as nursing homes.\&amp;nbsp;},

Understanding this neoplastic disease and its likely aetiological pathogen, chelonid alphaherpesvirus 5 (ChHV5), is crucial to understand how the disease impacts sea turtle populations and species and the future trajectory of disease incidence. We generated 20 ChHV5 genomes, from three sea turtle species, to better understand the viral variant diversity and gene evolution of this oncogenic virus. We revealed previously underappreciated genetic diversity within this virus (with an average of 2035 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs), 1.54\% of the ChHV5 genome) and identified genes under the strongest evolutionary pressure. Furthermore, we investigated the phylogeny of ChHV5 at both genome and gene level, confirming the propensity of the virus to be interspecific, with related variants able to infect multiple sea turtle species. Finally, we revealed unexpected intra-host diversity, with up to 0.15\% of the viral genome varying between ChHV5 genomes isolated from different tumours concurrently arising within the same individual. These findings offer important insights into ChHV5 biology and provide genomic resources for this oncogenic virus.},

Broader adoption of eDNA analysis will produce many well-recognized benefits for pathogen surveillance, biodiversity monitoring, endangered and invasive species detection, and population genetics. Here we show that deep-sequencing-based eDNA approaches capture genomic information from humans (Homo sapiens) just as readily as that from the intended target species. We term this phenomenon human genetic bycatch (HGB). Additionally, high-quality human eDNA could be intentionally recovered from environmental substrates (water, sand and air), holding promise for beneficial medical, forensic and environmental applications. However, this also raises ethical dilemmas, from consent, privacy and surveillance to data ownership, requiring further consideration and potentially novel regulation. We present evidence that human eDNA is readily detectable from ‘wildlife’ environmental samples as human genetic bycatch, demonstrate that identifiable human DNA can be intentionally recovered from human-focused environmental sampling and discuss the translational and ethical implications of such findings.},

Currently, the genetics of their crosstalk with the host remains unexplored. In this study, we use homology-based in silico approaches to characterize micro-RNAs (miRNAs) expressed by Sapria himalayana and Rafflesia cantleyi from published omics data. Derived from secondary structures or hairpins, miRNAs are small regulators of gene expression. We found that some plant-conserved miRNA still exists in Rafflesiaceae. Out of 9 highly conserved miRNA families in plants, 7 families (156/157, 159/319, 160, 165/166, 171, 172, 390) were identified with a total of 22 variants across Rafflesiaceae. Some miRNAs were missing endogenous targets and may have evolved to target host miRNA, though this requires experimental verification. Rafflesiaceae miRNA promoters are mostly inducible by ethylene that mediates stress response in the host but could be perceived by the parasites as a signal for growth. This study provides evidence that certain miRNAs with ancient origins in land plants still exist in Rafflesiaceae, though some may have been coopted by parasites to target host genes.},

Here, we analyzed RNA-seq profiles of parasites isolated from 32 \textit{P. falciparum-}infected adult travellers returning to Germany. Patients were categorized into either malaria naive (n = 15) or pre-exposed (n = 17), and into severe (n = 8) or non-severe (n = 24) cases. For differential expression analysis, \textit{Pf}EMP1-encoding \textit{var} gene transcripts were de novo assembled from RNA-seq data and, in parallel, \textit{var-}expressed sequence tags were analyzed and used to predict the encoded domain composition of the transcripts. Both approaches showed in concordance that severe malaria was associated with \textit{Pf}EMP1 containing the endothelial protein C receptor (EPCR)-binding CIDRα1 domain, whereas CD36-binding \textit{Pf}EMP1 was linked to non-severe malaria outcomes. First-time infected adults were more likely to develop severe symptoms and tended to be infected for a longer period. Thus, parasites with more pathogenic \textit{Pf}EMP1 variants are more common in patients with a naive immune status, and/or adverse inflammatory host responses to first infections favor the growth of EPCR-binding parasites.},

We isolated antimicrobial-resistant \textit{Escherichia coli} from three urban waterbodies over a 15-month time series, determined their antimicrobial susceptibilities, investigated their population structure, and identified genetic determinants of resistance. We found that \textit{E. coli} populations at each site were composed of different dominant phylotypes and showed distinct patterns of antimicrobial and multidrug resistance, despite close geographic proximity. Many strains that were genome-sequenced belonged to sequence types of international concern, particularly the ST131 clonal complex. We found widespread resistance to clinically important antimicrobials such as amoxicillin, cefotaxime, and ciprofloxacin, but found that all strains were susceptible to amikacin and the last-line antimicrobials meropenem and fosfomycin. Resistance was most often due to acquirable antimicrobial resistance genes, while chromosomal mutations in \textit{gyrA}, \textit{parC}, and \textit{parE} conferred resistance to quinolones. Whole-genome analysis of a subset of strains further revealed the diversity of the population of \textit{E. coli} present, with a wide array of AMR and virulence genes identified, many of which were present on the chromosome, including \textit{bla$_{\textrm{CTX-M}}$}. Finally, we determined that environmental persistence, transmission between sites, most likely mediated by wild birds, and transfer of mobile genetic elements likely contributed significantly to the patterns observed.IMPORTANCEA One Health perspective is crucial to understand the extent of antimicrobial resistance (AMR) globally, and investigation of AMR in the environment has been increasing in recent years. However, most studies have focused on waterways that are directly polluted by sewage, industrial manufacturing, or agricultural activities. Therefore, there remains a lack of knowledge about more natural, less overtly impacted environments. Through phenotypic and genotypic investigation of AMR in \textit{Escherichia coli}, this study adds to our understanding of the extent and patterns of resistance in these types of environments, including over a time series, and showed that complex biotic and abiotic factors contribute to the patterns observed. Our study further emphasizes the importance of incorporating the surveillance of microbes in freshwater environments in order to better comprehend potential risks for both human and animal health and how the environment may serve as a sentinel for potential future clinical infections.},

 abstract = {The deep sea is known to host novel bacteria with the potential to produce a diverse array of undiscovered natural products. Understanding these bacteria is thus of broad interest in ecology and could also underpin applied drug discovery, specifically in the area of antimicrobials. Here, we isolate a new strain of Streptomyces from the tissue of the deep-sea sponge Polymastia corticata collected at a depth of 1869 m from the Gramberg seamount in the Atlantic Ocean. This strain, which was given the initial designation A15ISP2-DRY2 T , has a genome size of 9.29 Mb with a GC content of 70.83\%. Phylogenomics determined that A15ISP2-DRY2 T represents a novel species within the genus Streptomyces as part of the Streptomyces aurantiacus clade. The biosynthetic potential of A15ISP2-DRY2 T was assessed relative to other members of the aurantiacus clade via comparative gene cluster family (GCF) analysis. This revealed a clear congruent relationship between phylogeny and GCF content. A15ISP2-DRY2 T contains six unique GCFs absent elsewhere in the clade. Culture-based assays were used to demonstrate the antibacterial activity of A15ISP2-DRY2 T against two drug-resistant human pathogens. We thus determine A15ISP2-DRY2 T to be a novel bacterial species with considerable biosynthetic potential and propose the systematic name Streptomyces ortus sp. nov. {\textless}h4{\textgreater}Impact Statement{\textless}/h4{\textgreater} The Streptomyces genus has contributed more to our antibiotic arsenal than any other group of bacteria or fungi. Despite decades of exploration, global analysis has suggested they still possess more undiscovered biosynthetic diversity than any other bacterial group. Isolating novel species of Streptomyces is therefore a priority for antibiotic discovery. Here we isolate a novel strain from a deep-sea sponge and use comparative cluster analysis to identify six biosynthetic clusters unique to our deep-sea strain. This work demonstrates the utility of continuing to isolate novel Streptomyces strains for antibiotic discovery and, for the first time, we used species tree-gene cluster tree reconciliation to assess the contribution of vertical evolution on the biosynthetic gene cluster content of Streptomyces .},

 abstract = {Histone acetylation regulates gene expression, cell function and cell fate1. Here we study the pattern of histone acetylation in the epithelial tissue of the Drosophila wing disc. H3K18ac, H4K8ac and total lysine acetylation are increased in the outer rim of the disc. This acetylation pattern is controlled by nuclear position, whereby nuclei continuously move from apical to basal locations within the epithelium and exhibit high levels of H3K18ac when they are in proximity to the tissue surface. These surface nuclei have increased levels of acetyl-CoA synthase, which generates the acetyl-CoA for histone acetylation. The carbon source for histone acetylation in the rim is fatty acid β-oxidation, which is also increased in the rim. Inhibition of fatty acid β-oxidation causes H3K18ac levels to decrease in the genomic proximity of genes involved in disc development. In summary, there is a physical mark of the outer rim of the wing and other imaginal epithelia in Drosophila that affects gene expression.},

 abstract = {Mass spectrometry imaging (MSI) enables the unbiased characterization of surfaces with respect to their chemical composition. In biological MSI, zones with differentialmass profiles hint towards localized physiological processes, such as the tissue-specific accumulation of secondary metabolites, or diseases, such as cancer. Thus, the efficientdiscovery of ‘regions of interest’ (ROI) is of utmost importance in MSI. However, often the discovery of ROIs is hampered by high background noise and artifact signals. Especially in ambient ionization MSI, unmasking biologically relevant information from crude data sets is challenging. Therefore, we implemented a Threshold Intensity Quantization (TrIQ) algorithm for augmenting the contrast in MSI data visualizations. The simple algorithm reduces the impact of extreme values (‘outliers’) and rescales the dynamic range of mass signals. We provide an R script for post-processing MSI data in the imzML community format (https://bitbucket.org/lababi/msi.r) and implemented the TrIQ in our open-source imaging software RmsiGUI (https://bitbucket.org/lababi/rmsigui/). Applying these programs to different biological MSI data sets demonstrated the universal applicability of TrIQ for improving the contrast in the MSI data visualization. We show that TrIQ improves a subsequent detection of ROIs by sectioning. In addition, the adjustment of the dynamic signal intensity range makes MSI data sets comparable.},

 abstract = {{\textless}h4{\textgreater}Background: {\textless}/h4{\textgreater} We previously reported that a Human Ro52 gene sequence (TRIM21) produced a significant stretch of protein sequence homologous to T . cruzi Antigen 36 (Ag 36) protein sequence, when Ag 36 was translated in the second reading frame. Comparison of their respective DNA sequences demonstrated a 114 nucleotide region of both genes having {\textasciitilde} 70 percent partial homology. After Ro52 was shown to be an E3 Ubiquitin dependent Type I ligase for transcription factors for Interferon genes, we proposed that the Ag 36 gene, which contains a repetitive motif within it, may function to repress Ro52 in the human heart through RNA interference, or other unknown mechanism, giving rise to autoimmunity found in Chronic Chagas Cardiomyopathy (CCC). Results To test that hypothesis, we compared various mammalian TRIM genes to the T . cruzi Ag 36 DNA sequence using the Needleman-Wunsch algorithm in the http:{\textbackslash}{\textbackslash}usegalaxy.eu bioinformatics tool base. In addition to human and chimpanzee, TRIM21 comparable gene regions from canine, shrew, ferret, bat, feline, and armadillo, and aardvark showed homology to the gene for Ag 36 ranging from 68 to 30 percent. However, mouse and eight other mammalian species showed no significant homology. Since mice have been shown to have severe cardiac cardiomyopathy after infection, but their TRIM21 was not homologous to Ag 36 in this study, we conclude that the gene homology has no causative link to CCC. Conclusions In addition to human TRIM21, eight mammalian species showed partial gene homology to T. cruzi Ag 36, and some of these have been demonstrated to have CCC. However, rats and mice TRIM21 showed no partial homology to Ag 36. Since these species have been demonstrated to have CCC, the partial gene homology between Ag36 and TRIM 21 may not be causative or associated with CCC, as was originally hypothesized.},

TRIM40 showed 9.7\% identity to GenBank M21331, and four additional TRIM genes had identities greater than 5.0\%. TRIM37 showed a continuous stretch of identity of 12 nucleotides, that is, at least 25\% longer than any of the other TRIMs. When we extended our analysis on the relationships of GenBank M21331 to further innate immune genes, using the Needleman-Wunsch (NW) algorithm for alignment, identities to human IFN-α, IFN-β, and IFN-γ genes of 13.6\%, 12.6\%, and 17.9\%, respectively, were found. To determine the minimum number of genes coding for proteins closely related to Ag 36, a BLAST-p search was conducted with it versus the T. cruzi genome. The BLAST-p search revealed that T. cruzi GenBank M21331 had 14 gene sequences homologous to microtubule-associated protein (MAP) genes with 100\% amino acid sequence identity. To verify the similarities in non-human genes, a study comparing TRIM21 region sequences among mammalian species to the comparable human TRIM21 region showed that related sequences were also present in 11 mammalian species. The MAP genes homologous to Ag 36 form a family of at least 14 genes which mimic human immune genes in the IFN and TRIM families. This mimicry is of gene sequences and not their protein products or epitopes. These results appear to be the first description of molecular mimicry of immune genes in humans by a protozoan parasite.},

Identification of the core microbiome by metagenome analysis and prediction of functional characteristics are essential to make microalgal feedstock more sustainable and economically feasible. Biogas production from photoautotrophically grown Chlorella vulgaris (Ch. vulgaris) biomass (240 mL CH4 g oTS-1) and co-fermentation with maize silage (330 mL CH4 g oTS-1) has been studied in semi continuous laboratory biogas fermenters. Maize silage control yielded 310 mL CH4 g oTS-1. The microbial community and the read-based functional profiles, derived from these data, were examined during the process by using next-generation metagenome Ion Torrent sequencing technology. The read-based core microbiome consisted of 92 genera from which 60 abundant taxa were directly associated with the microbial methane producing food chain. The data-set was also analyzed in a genome-based approach. 65 bins were assembled, 52 of them belonged in the core biogas producing genera identified by the read-based metagenomes. The read-based and genome-based approaches complemented and verified each other. The functional profiles indicated a variety of glycoside hydrolases. Substantial rearrangements of the methanogen functions have also been observed. Co-fermentation of algal biomass and plant biomass can be carried out for an extended period of time without process failure. The microbial members of the inoculum are well conserved, feedstock composition cause relative abundance changes in the core microbiome.},

The use of liquid wastes as nutrient clearly improves the sustainability of microalgal biofuel production. Microalgae and bacteria have an ecological inter-kingdom relationship. This microenvironment called phycosphere has a major role in the ecosystem productivity and can be utilized both in bioremediation and biomass production. However, knowledge on the effects of indigenous bacteria on microalgal growth and the characteristics of bacterial communities associated with microalgae are limited. In this study municipal, industrial and agricultural liquid waste derivatives were used as cultivation media. Chlorella vulgaris green microalgae and its bacterial partners efficiently metabolized the carbon, nitrogen and phosphorous content available in these wastes. The read-based metagenomics approach revealed a diverse microbial composition at the start point of cultivations in the different types of liquid wastes. The relative abundance of the observed taxa significantly changed over the cultivation period. The genome-centric reconstruction of phycospheric bacteria further explained the observed correlations between the taxonomic composition and biomass yield of the various waste-based biodegradation systems. Functional profile investigation of the reconstructed microbes revealed a variety of relevant biological processes like organic acid oxidation and vitamin B synthesis.

 abstract = {IntroductionChronic heart failure is associated with adverse remodeling of the heart that is typically characterized by cardiomyocyte hypertrophy. This requires the formation of new capillaries to maintain oxygen supply. Insufficient angiogenesis promotes the transition from compensated hypertrophy into heart failure. The aim of the present study was to identify angiogenesis-related gene networks and corresponding regulatory hubs in endothelial cells from failing human hearts.Methods and resultsWe isolated left ventricular endothelial cells from patients with advanced heart failure undergoing left ventricular assist device surgery (n = 15) and healthy organ donors (n = 2) and performed RNA sequencing. Subgroup analysis revealed no impact of co-morbidities on gene expression. In a weighted coexpression network analysis, we found 26 gene clusters, of which nine clusters showed a significant positive or negative correlation with the presence of heart failure. We identified the transcription factors CASZ1 (castor zinc finger 1), ZNF523 (zinc finger protein 523), and NFE2L1 (nuclear factor erythroid 2-related factor 1) as hub genes of a cluster related to angiogenesis. Knock-down of CASZ1, ZNF523, or NFE2L1 in human umbilical vein endothelial cells led to a downregulation of genes from the respective cluster, including CD34 and platelet derived growth factor β, confirming their regulatory function.ConclusionIn conclusion, we assessed gene networks in endothelial cells and identified transcription factors CASZ1, ZNF532, and NFE2L1 as potential regulators of angiogenesis in failing human hearts. Our study provides insights into the transcriptional regulation of angiogenesis beyond the classical vascular endothelial growth factor signaling pathway.},

 abstract = {The malaria parasite replicates asexually in the red blood cells of its vertebrate host employing epigenetic mechanisms to regulate gene expression in response to changes in its environment. We used chromatin immunoprecipitation followed by sequencing in conjunction with RNA sequencing to create an epigenomic and transcriptomic map of the developmental transition from asexual blood stages to male and female gametocytes and to ookinetes in the rodent malaria parasite Plasmodium berghei. Across the developmental stages examined, heterochromatin protein 1 associates with variantly expressed gene families localised at subtelomeric regions and variant gene expression based on heterochromatic silencing is observed only in some genes. Conversely, the euchromatin mark histone 3 lysine 9 acetylation (H3K9ac) is abundant in non-heterochromatic regions across all developmental stages. H3K9ac presents a distinct pattern of enrichment around the start codon of ribosomal protein genes in all stages but male gametocytes. Additionally, H3K9ac occupancy positively correlates with transcript abundance in all stages but female gametocytes suggesting that transcription in this stage is independent of H3K9ac levels. This finding together with known mRNA repression in female gametocytes suggests a multilayered mechanism operating in female gametocytes in preparation for fertilization and zygote development, coinciding with parasite transition from host to vector.},

Workflow Frameworks for Research (CWFR) initiative suggests a large-scale
introduction of self-documenting workflow scripts to automate recurring

 abstract = {Microglia are the tissue-resident macrophages of the retina and brain, being critically involved in organ development, tissue homeostasis, and response to cellular damage. Until now, little is known about the molecular signature of human retinal microglia and how it differs from the one of brain microglia and peripheral monocytes. In addition, it is not yet clear to what extent murine retinal microglia resemble those of humans, which represents an important prerequisite for translational research. The present study applies fluorescence-activated cell sorting to isolate human retinal microglia from enucleated eyes and compares their transcriptional profile with the one of whole retinal tissue, human brain microglia as well as classical, intermediate and non-classical monocytes. Finally, human retinal microglia are compared to murine retinal microglia, isolated from Cx3cr1GFP/+ mice. Whereas human retinal microglia exhibited a high grade of similarity in comparison to their counterparts in the brain, several enriched genes were identified in retinal microglia when compared to whole retinal tissue, as well as classical, intermediate, and non-classical monocytes. In relation to whole retina sequencing, several risk genes associated with age-related macular degeneration (AMD) and diabetic retinopathy (DR) were preferentially expressed in retinal microglia, indicating their potential pathophysiological involvement. Although a high degree of similarity was observed between human and murine retinal microglia, several species-specific genes were identified, which should be kept in mind when employing mouse models to investigate retinal microglia biology. In summary, this study provides detailed insights into the molecular profile of human retinal microglia, identifies a plethora of tissue-specific and species-specific genes in comparison to human brain microglia and murine retinal microglia, and thus highlights the significance of retinal microglia in human retinal diseases and for translational research approaches.},

This study characterizes the transcriptional profile and the cellular microenvironment of conjunctival pterygia and identifies novel pterygia-specific biomarkers. Formalin-fixed and paraffin-embedded pterygia as well as healthy conjunctival specimens were analyzed using MACE RNA sequencing (\textit{n} = 8 each) and immunohistochemistry (pterygia \textit{n} = 7, control \textit{n} = 3). According to the bioinformatic cell type enrichment analysis using xCell, the cellular microenvironment of pterygia was characterized by an enrichment of myofibroblasts, T-lymphocytes and various antigen-presenting cells, including dendritic cells and macrophages. Differentially expressed genes that were increased in pterygia compared to control tissue were mainly involved in autophagy (including \textit{DCN, TMBIM6}), cellular response to stress (including \textit{TPT1, DDX5}) as well as fibroblast proliferation and epithelial to mesenchymal transition (including \textit{CTNNB1, TGFBR1, and FN1}). Immunohistochemical analysis confirmed a significantly increased FN1 stromal immunoreactivity in pterygia when compared to control tissue. In addition, a variety of factors involved in apoptosis were significantly downregulated in pterygia, including \textit{LCN2, CTSD}, and \textit{NISCH}. Furthermore, 450 pterygia-specific biomarkers were identified by including transcriptional data of different ocular surface pathologies serving as controls (training group), which were then validated using transcriptional data of cultured human pterygium cells. Among the most pterygia-specific factors were transcripts such as \textit{AHNAK, RTN4, TPT1, FSTL1}, and \textit{SPARC}. Immunohistochemical validation of SPARC revealed a significantly increased stromal immunoreactivity in pterygia when compared to controls, most notably in vessels and intravascular vessel wall-adherent mononuclear cells. Taken together, the present study provides new insights into the cellular microenvironment and the transcriptional profile of pterygia, identifies new and specific biomarkers and in addition to fibrosis-related genes, uncovers autophagy, stress response and apoptosis modulation as pterygium-associated processes. These findings expand our understanding of the pathophysiology of pterygia, provide new diagnostic tools, and may enable new targeted therapeutic options for this common and sight-threatening ocular surface disease.},

@article{wolf_corneal_2020,
 abstract = {Purpose
Immune reactions following corneal transplantation are the most common cause of transplant failure. However, the underlying mechanisms of corneal graft rejection are not yet fully understood but increasing evidence points to a crucial role of the innate immune system in this context. Using a human in vitro model, we aimed to assess the response of human macrophages to stimulation with human corneal tissue and whether corneal endothelial cells (CEC) have immune-modulating properties.
Methods
Human monocytes were isolated from peripheral blood mononuclear cells and differentiated into monocyte-derived macrophages (MDM). A standardized protocol was used for disaggregation of human corneas into fragments of defined sizes. MDMs were stimulated using processed corneal material with or without CEC. Lipopolysaccharide (LPS) or interferon-gamma (IFNγ) served as controls. RNA sequencing was applied to analyze the impact of differential stimulation of MDMs on their transcriptional profile. RNA sequencing results were validated using digital PCR.
Results
The transcriptional profile of MDMs was significantly modulated by the type of stimulus used for MDM activation as well as by the individual MDM donor. LPS- or IFNγ-stimulation resulted in distinct transcriptional alterations compared to unstimulated MDMs including an upregulation of various cytokines such as CCL3, 4, 5, 19 or CXCL9. Corneal tissue induced the differential expression of 45 genes when compared to unstimulated MDMs, with several metallothioneins (MTs) among the upregulated factors (MT1A, MT1E, MT1F, MT1G, MT1H, MT1L, MT1M, MT1X, MT2A). This effect was independent of the presence or absence of CEC. PCR validation confirmed induction of 3 different metallothioneins (MT1G, MT1H and MT2A) in MDMs stimulated by corneal tissue.
Conclusions
The MDM in vitro model proved to be a robust tool to study the effects of LPS, IFNγ and corneal tissue homogenates on the transcriptional activity of MDM. Human macrophages showed a distinct upregulation of various MTs when challenged with human corneal allogen with or without corneal endothelium, which might have an immune-modulatory effect. As a general observation, it appears that in MDM-based studies a significant donor-dependent effect on the transcriptional profile of MDMs needs to be considered and adjusted before downstream analysis.},

The purpose of this study is to gain new insights into the biology and function of human hyalocytes in comparison to other innate immune cells.    The present study applies fluorescence-activated cell sorting and RNA sequencing to compare the transcriptional profiles of human hyalocytes, retinal microglia (rMG) and classical, intermediate, and non-classical monocytes isolated from the same patients. Immunohistochemistry was applied for morphological characterization of human hyalocytes.    Pairwise analysis indicates distinct differences between hyalocytes and monocytes, whereas a high degree of similarity to rMG is apparent, with comparable expression levels of established microglia markers, such as TREM2, P2RY12, and TMEM119. Among the top expressed genes in hyalocytes, SPP1, CD74, and C3, were significantly upregulated when compared with monocytes. Despite the high level of similarity of hyalocytes and rMG, ten highly expressed genes in hyalocytes compared to microglia were identified, among them FOS, DUSP1, and EGR2.    This study reveals a high degree of similarity between hyalocytes and retinal microglia. Nevertheless, hyalocytes exhibit some expression differences that may adapt them to the specific needs of the vitreous and provide the basis for deciphering the multiple roles of this fascinating cell population in health and vitreoretinal diseases.},

 abstract = {Background
Retinoblastoma is a rare pediatric eye cancer caused by mutations in the RB1 gene, which regulates retinal cell growth. Early detection and treatment are critical for preventing vision loss and improving survival outcomes. This study aimed to perform an integrated proteotranscriptomic characterization of human retinoblastoma to provide a deeper understanding of disease biology and to identify novel therapeutic targets.

Methods
Paired tumor and adjacent retinal tissue samples were dissected from seven eyes. RNA sequencing and liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry were performed on the same samples. The spatially resolved cellular landscape was assessed using Imaging Mass Cytometry (IMC).

Results
The correlation between RNA and protein level was moderate with variations across different pathways, underscoring the value of an integrated proteotranscriptomic approach. IMC identified more than 67,000 single cells in 11 distinct clusters, including antigen presenting cells, T cells, stroma cells, vascular cells and two clusters of proliferating and CD44/c-Myc positive tumor cells. Antigen presenting cells expressed higher levels of CD68 in retinoblastoma compared to controls. 

Conclusions
CD44+ and high-c-Myc-expressing tumor cells may represent cancer stem cells with possible involvement in metastasis, warranting further validation. Our multilayered approach could pave the way for enhanced molecular assessments and novel targeted therapies for human retinoblastoma.},

Eight healthy conjunctival specimens served as controls.

 abstract = {Corneal transplantation is one of the most common forms of tissue transplantation worldwide. Donor corneal tissue used in transplantation is provided by eye banks, which store the tissue in culture medium after procurement. To date, the effects of cell culture on human corneal tissue have not been fully elucidated. Using the 3' RNA sequencing method for massive analysis of cDNA ends (MACE), we show that cultivation of corneal tissue leads to significant changes in a variety of molecular processes in human corneal tissue that go well beyond aspects of previously known culture effects. Functionally grouped network analysis revealed nine major groups of biological processes that were affected by corneal organ culture, among them keratinization, hypoxia, and angiogenesis, with genes from each group being affected by culture time. A cell type deconvolution analysis revealed significant modulations of the corneal immune cell profile in a time dependent manner. The results suggest that current culture conditions should be further refined and that prolonged cultivation may be detrimental. Recently, we showed that MACE enables transcriptional profiling of formalin-fixed and paraffin-embedded (FFPE) conjunctival tissue with high accuracy even after more than 10 years of storage. Here we demonstrate that MACE provides comparable results for native and FFPE corneal tissue, confirming that the technology is suitable for transcriptome analysis of a wide range of archived diseased corneal samples stored in histological archives. Finally, our data underscore the feasibility of bioinformatics cell-type enrichment analysis in bulk RNA-seq data to profile immune cell composition in fixed and archived corneal tissue samples, for which RNA-seq analysis of individual cells is often not possible.},

Ten formalin-fixed and paraffin-embedded conjunctival EMZL and eight healthy conjunctival specimens were analyzed by Massive Analysis of cDNA Ends (MACE) RNA sequencing. The 3417 upregulated genes in conjunctival EMZL were involved in processes such as B cell proliferation and Rac protein signaling, whereas the 1188 downregulated genes contributed most significantly to oxidative phosphorylation and UV protection. The tumor microenvironment, as determined by deconvolution analysis, was mainly composed of multiple B cell subtypes which reflects the tumor’s B cell lineage. However, several T cell types, including T helper 2 cells and regulatory T cells, as well as innate immune cell types, such as anti-inflammatory macrophages and plasmacytoid dendritic cells, were also strongly enriched in conjunctival EMZL. A 13-biomarker prognostic panel, including S100A8 and S100A9, classified ocular and extraocular tumor recurrence, exceeded prognostic accuracy of Ann Arbor and American Joint Committee on Cancer (AJCC) staging, and demonstrated prognostic value for patient survival in 21 different cancer types in a database of 12,332 tumor patients.

 abstract = {During the last decade, ncRNAs have been investigated intensively and revealed their regulatory role in various biological processes. Worldwide research efforts have identified numerous ncRNAs and multiple RNA subtypes, which are attributed to diverse functionalities known to interact with different functional layers, from DNA and RNA to proteins. This makes the prediction of functions for newly identified ncRNAs challenging. Current bioinformatics and systems biology approaches show promising results to facilitate an identification of these diverse ncRNA functionalities. Here, we review (a) current experimental protocols, i.e., for Next Generation Sequencing, for a successful identification of ncRNAs; (b) sequencing data analysis workflows as well as available computational environments; and (c) state-of-the-art approaches to functionally characterize ncRNAs, e.g., by means of transcriptome-wide association studies, molecular network analyses, or artificial intelligence guided prediction. In addition, we present a strategy to cover the identification and functional characterization of unknown transcripts by using connective workflows.},

 abstract = {Modern diagnostics is in general based on molecular biology methods. Nowadays sequencing-based methods, especially whole genome sequencing, are becoming increasingly important. Implementation of such methods into routine diagnostic of highly dangerous pathogens, like Bacillus anthracis, Francisella tularensis, Yersinia pestis, Ebola virus, MERS, Lassa virus etc. would be very helpful. The best diagnostic strategy would be the metagenomic sequencing directly from the clinical sample. Implementation of majority of currently available WGS platforms inside the BSL-3 or 4 laboratory is impractical because of the size of the equipment and time consuming wet lab part (e.g. library preparation). Nowadays there is a possibility to implement pocket size MinION - real time whole genome sequencer into BSL-3 and 4 laboratory for rapid and precise diagnostic purposes.},

 abstract = {Magnetotactic bacteria produce membrane-bound organelles known as magnetosomes, which consist of chains of magnetite crystals and function as sensors for orientation within the Earth’s magnetic field. Magnetosome biosynthesis is a complex, multistep process that depends on iron availability and suboxic conditions. However, the expression of the ca. 30 core magnetosome biosynthetic genes has previously been described as constitutive and largely unaffected by environmental conditions.A recent study by Pang et al., published in this journal, reported the identification of a transcriptional regulator, NsrRMg, which was proposed to activate magnetosome biosynthesis in Magnetospirillum gryphiswaldense in response to the endogenous signaling molecule nitric oxide (NO). Furthermore, the study suggested that NO also regulates a putative, previously unrecognized nitrification pathway that presumably supports endogenous NO production via denitrification, even in the absence of extracellular nitrate.Here, we present results of genetic and transcriptional analyses demonstrating that, contrary to the findings of Pang et al., NsrRMg is not required for magnetosome biosynthesis. We also refute the existence of the proposed nitrification pathway and conclude that there is no compelling evidence supporting a role of NsrRMg as a key regulator of magnetosome formation in M. gryphiswaldense.},

@article{wu_differential_2025,
 abstract = {As ectotherms highly sensitive to environmental temperature fluctuations, skinks (a small lizard) are increasingly vulnerable to population instability due to global heatwaves. A clade model analysis of four Chinese skink species (Plestiodon capito, Plestiodon chinensis, Sphenomorphus indicus, and Scincella modesta) revealed positive selection acting on the ND6 gene in Sp. indicus. This species exhibits codon alterations in ND6, shifts its expression pathway and potentially decouples ND6 from high-temperature stress response mechanisms. To validate these findings, transcriptomic profiling was conducted to assess mitochondrial protein-coding gene (PCG) expression patterns under thermal stress. Using RT-qPCR, liver mitochondrial PCG transcript levels were compared between high-temperature (34 °C) and control (25 °C) groups in skink populations from distinct latitudes. Low-latitude species (P. chinensis and Sc. modesta) exhibited metabolic downregulation, characterized by a significant suppression of mitochondrial gene expression. Specifically, P. chinensis showed the downregulation of six mitochondrial genes (COII, COIII, ATP6, ND2, ND4, ND6) while upregulating one (ND1). By contrast, Sc. modesta showed the downregulation of nine genes (COI, COII, COIII, ATP8, ND1, ND3, ND4, ND4L, CYTB) and upregulated two (ND5, ND6). By contrast, high-latitude species exhibited divergent patterns: P. capito downregulated four genes (COI, COII, COIII, ND4L) and upregulated four others (ND1, ND2, ND3, ND4), whereas Sp. indicus downregulated six genes (COI, COII, ND2, ND3, ND4, ND4L) and upregulated one (ND5). These regulatory disparities suggest that low-latitude skinks have a greater capacity for metabolic depression to cope with chronic stress, whereas their high-latitude counterparts exhibit different adaptations. The findings provide valuable insights into assessing the adaptive potential of species in warming environments, particularly for ectotherms with limited thermoregulatory capacities.},

As a pioneer in planctomycetal research, he isolated numerous strains belonging to the phylum Planctomycetota from aquatic habitats around the world. Phylogenetic analyses show that strain SH412T belongs to the family Planctomycetaceae and shares with 91.6\% the highest 16S rRNA gene sequence similarity with Planctopirus limnophila DSM 3776T. Its genome has a length of 7.3 Mb and a G + C content of 63.6\%. Optimal growth of strain SH412T occurs at pH 7.0–7.5 and 28 °C with its pigmentation depending on sunlight exposure. Strain SH412T reproduces by polar asymmetric division (“budding”) and forms ovoid cells. The cell size determination was performed using a semi-automatic pipeline, which we first evaluated with the model species P. limnophila and then applied to strain SH412T. Furthermore, the data acquired during time-lapse analyses suggests a lifestyle switch from flagellated daughter cells to non-flagellated mother cells in the subsequent cycle. Based on our data, we suggest that strain SH412T represents a novel species within a novel genus, for which we propose the name Planctoellipticum variicoloris gen. nov., sp. nov., with strain SH412T (= CECT 30430T = STH00996T, the STH number refers to the Jena Microbial Resource Collection JMRC) as the type strain of the new species.},

 abstract = {Klebsiella pneumoniae is an important uropathogen that increasingly harbors broad-spectrum antibiotic resistance determinants. Evidence suggests that some same-strain recurrences in women with frequent urinary tract infections (UTIs) may emanate from a persistent intravesicular reservoir. Our objective was to analyze K. pneumoniae isolates collected over weeks from multiple body sites of a single patient with recurrent UTI in order to track ordered strain progression across body sites, as has been employed across patients in outbreak settings. Whole-genome sequencing of 26 K. pneumoniae isolates was performed utilizing the Illumina platform. PacBio sequencing was used to create a refined reference genome of the original urinary isolate (TOP52). Sequence variation was evaluated by comparing the 26 isolate sequences to the reference genome sequence. Whole-genome sequencing of the K. pneumoniae isolates from six different body sites of this patient with recurrent UTI demonstrated 100\% chromosomal sequence identity of the isolates, with only a small P2 plasmid deletion in a minority of isolates. No single nucleotide variants were detected. The complete absence of single-nucleotide variants from 26 K. pneumoniae isolates from multiple body sites collected over weeks from a patient with recurrent UTI suggests that, unlike in an outbreak situation with strains collected from numerous patients, other methods are necessary to discern strain progression within a single host over a relatively short time frame.},

Indirect disruption of the electron transport chain by gene editing of SLC25A mitochondrial membrane transporters as well as direct genetic and pharmacological disruption of either complexes I, III, or the copper-containing complex IV of the electron transport chain elicited upregulation of APOE transcript, protein, and secretion, up to 49-fold. These APOE phenotypes were robustly expressed in diverse cell types and iPSC-derived human astrocytes as part of an inflammatory gene expression program. Moreover, age- and genotype-dependent decline in brain levels of respiratory complex I preceded an increase in APOE in the 5xFAD mouse model. We propose that mitochondria act as novel upstream regulators of APOE-dependent cellular processes in health and disease.},

For this alternative to be effective, understanding phage-host interactions is crucial for the selection of candidate phages and offers new insights into these dynamics. \textbf{Background/Objectives}: This study aimed to characterize prophage diversity in clinical \textit{P. aeruginosa} genomes, assess the relationship between phages and the CRISPR/Cas system, and investigate the potential role of prophages in disseminating resistance genes. \textbf{Methods}: A total of 141 genomes from Brazilian hospitals were analyzed. Prophage detection was performed using VIBRANT, and in silico analyses were conducted to evaluate taxonomic diversity, the presence of resistance genes, phage life cycle, genomic distribution, and the presence of the CRISPR/Cas system. \textbf{Results}: A total of 841 viral sequences were identified by the VIBRANT tool, of which 498 were confirmed by CheckV, with a predominance of the class Caudoviricetes and high overall phage diversity. No statistically significant difference was observed in the number of prophages between isolates with and without CRISPR/Cas systems. Prophages carrying resistance genes such as \textit{rsmA}, \textit{OXA-56}, \textit{SPM-1}, and others were detected in isolates harboring the type I-C CRISPR/Cas system. Additionally, prophages showed no preference for specific insertion sites along the bacterial genome. \textbf{Conclusions}: These findings provide evidence of a well-established phage-host relationship. The dual role of prophages-as vectors of antimicrobial resistance and as potential therapeutic agents-reflects their dynamic impact on bacterial communities and reinforces their importance in developing new strategies to combat antimicrobial resistance.},

Our results indicated that these four mitogenomes, including A. separata, A. quadrivittata, G. parviseta, and P. vulgaris, comprised 37 mitochondrial genes and an A+T-control region, with a total length of 16,603 bp, 16,112 bp, 16,691 bp, and 16,594 bp, revealing a notably high AT content reaching 77.4\%, 78.4\%, 75.1\%, and 75.1\%, respectively. Our phylogenetic analyses using Bayesian inference and Maximum Likelihood methods under site-homogeneous models consistently demonstrated their superiority over the site-heterogeneous mixture model CAT + GTR, given the currently accepted phylogenetic framework. Apart from a few species demonstrating unstable placements, the inferred phylogenetic relationships among the three tribes were strongly supported as monophyletic groups, with the topology represented as ((Ceratitidini + Gastrozonini) + Dacini), and most branches displaying moderate-to-high support values, of which four newly sequenced mitogenomes and A. dissimilis robustly formed a single clade representing Gastrozonini. This study substantially augments the existing mitogenome data, thereby providing more profound insight into the evolutionary history and higher-level phylogenetic structure within the Dacinae.},

Distinct evolutionary dynamics were detected among protein-coding genes, ribosomal RNAs, transfer RNAs, and the control region. Heterogeneity analyses and phylogenetic analyses showed that amino acid datasets perform better for basal branch of Orthocladiinae relationships, although the resolution within non-basal branches of Orthocladiinae remains limited. By substantially increasing both the number and taxonomic breadth of mitochondrial genomes in Chironomidae, this study delivers a vital foundation for future multi-marker phylogenetic reconstruction, taxonomic revision, and rapid species identification, with direct applications to biodiversity conservation and freshwater ecosystem monitoring.},

@article{yaghoubi_khanghahi_transcriptomic_2025,
 abstract = {This study investigates the efficacy of plant growth-promoting bacteria (PGPB) in improving stress tolerance in plants by analyzing the molecular and biochemical bases in durum wheat grain. An experiment was conducted where soil and seeds were inoculated with PGPB, under drought and salinity stress. 16 S rRNA sequencing indicated no change in grain bacterial communities in response to biofertilizers and stress. However, a genome-wide analysis identified 153 up-regulated and 33 down-regulated plant genes in response to PGPB, predominantly enriched in stress-related biological processes. These genes specifically encode for proteins involved in metabolite interconversion enzyme, chaperone, protein modifying enzyme, and transporters, which are functionally related groups assisting protein folding in the cell under stress conditions. Moreover, pathway analysis confirmed related changes at the metabolite and enzyme activity levels. In this regard, PGPB-treated plants exhibited heightened activity of both enzymatic and non-enzymatic (e.g., thioredoxins, peroxiredoxins, etc.) antioxidants under stress, showcasing significant enhancements ranging from + 27\% to + 283\% and + 36\% to + 266\%, respectively. Further elucidation of biochemical pathways revealed alterations in the activation of non-antioxidant enzymes in PGPB-treated plants, exemplified by increased activities of glutamate synthase (40-44\%) and decreased activities of protein-tyrosine-phosphatase (29-31\%) under both stresses, as well as elevated activities of anthocyanidin reductase (91\%) and lipoxygenases (18\%) specifically under drought. Overall, the present research highlighted the potential of beneficial bacteria in improving plant stress tolerance, especially under drought, through shifting transcriptome expression of plant genes and employing multiple protective strategies which can complement each other.Supplementary informationThe online version contains supplementary material available at 10.1007/s12298-025-01686-z.},

 abstract = {Direct interspecies electron transfer (DIET) has been demonstrated to be an efficient type of mutualism in methanogenesis. However, few studies have reported its presence in mixed microbial communities and its trigger mechanism in the natural environment and engineered systems. Here, we reported DIET-like mutualism of Geobacter and methanogens in the planktonic microbiome for the first time in anaerobic electrochemical digestion (AED) fed with propionate, potentially triggered by excessive cathodic hydrogen (56 times higher than the lowest) under the electrochemical condition. In contrast with model prediction without DIET, the highest current density and hydrogen and methane production were concurrently observed at −0.2 V where an abundance of Geobacter (49\%) and extracellular electron transfer genes were identified in the planktonic microbiome via metagenomic analysis. Metagenomic assembly genomes annotated to Geobacter anodireducens were identified alongside two methanogens, Methanothrix harundinacea and Methanosarcina mazei, which were previously identified to participate in DIET. This discovery revealed that DIET-like mutualism could be triggered without external conductive materials, highlighting its potentially ubiquitous presence. Such mutualism simultaneously boosted methane and hydrogen production, thereby demonstrating the potential of AED in engineering applications.},

@article{yang_opposing_2025,
 abstract = {Gene duplication generates gene paralogs that may undergo diverse fates during evolution, and thus serves as a potent catalyst of biological complexity. Genetic paralogs frequently share redundant functions and may also exhibit antagonistic activities by competing for common interaction partners. Here we show that the gene paralogs NRBP1 and NRBP2 oppositely regulate long interspersed nuclear element-1 (L1) retrotransposition, via influencing integrity of the L1 ribonucleoprotein complex. We demonstrate that the opposing roles of NRBP1 and NRBP2 are not results of a competitive mechanism, but rather due to targeting NRBP1 for degradation by NRBP2, probably through heterodimer formation. Moreover, our phylogenetic analysis shows that the regulatory function of NRBP2 may be acquired later during evolution, suggesting that evolutionary pressure has favored this functional fine-tuning of NRBP1. In summary, our findings not only identify NRBP1/2 as L1 regulators and implicate their involvement in human pathogenesis, but also provide a mechanistic insight into the regulatory details arising from gene duplication.},

@article{yanta_cryptogenotyper_2021,
 abstract = {Cryptosporidium is a protozoan parasite that is transmitted to both humans and animals through zoonotic or anthroponotic means. When a host is infected with this parasite, it causes a gastrointestinal disease known as cryptosporidiosis. To understand the transmission dynamics of Cryptosporidium, the small subunit (SSU or 18S) rRNA and gp60 genes are commonly studied through PCR analysis and conventional Sanger sequencing. However, analyzing sequence chromatograms manually is both time consuming and prone to human error, especially in the presence of poorly resolved, heterozygous peaks and the absence of a validated database. For this study, we developed a Cryptosporidium genotyping tool, called CryptoGenotyper, which has the capability to read raw Sanger sequencing data for the two common Cryptosporidium gene targets (SSU rRNA and gp60) and classify the sequence data into standard nomenclature. The CryptoGenotyper has the capacity to perform quality control and properly classify sequences using a high quality, manually curated reference database, saving users' time and removing bias during data analysis. The incorporated heterozygous base calling algorithms for the SSU rRNA gene target resolves double peaks, therefore recovering data previously classified as inconclusive. The CryptoGenotyper successfully genotyped 99.3\% (428/431) and 95.1\% (154/162) of SSU rRNA chromatograms containing single and mixed sequences, respectively, and correctly subtyped 95.6\% (947/991) of gp60 chromatograms without manual intervention. This new, user-friendly tool can provide both fast and reproducible analyses of Sanger sequencing data for the two most common Cryptosporidium gene targets.},

 abstract = {The biodegradation of lignite (brown coal) by microorganisms has the potential for bioremediation of contaminated mining sites and to generate alternative ways to valorize lignite, such as by producing humic acids or building block chemicals. Previously, a lignite-degrading strain of Trichoderma was isolated, but the genomic and transcriptomic basis of its lignite-degrading ability remained unknown. Here we report that the sequenced genome of the T. cf. simile WF8 strain encoded for enzymes with roles in the degradation of lignite, and potentially tolerance to lignite-breakdown products. There was only a small number of annotated unique genes in the T. cf. simile WF8 genome compared to other fungi, and likely the expression of gene families shared with other fungi is a key factor in lignite biosolubilization by T. cf. simile. The transcriptomes were analyzed of T. cf. simile cultured at two time-points with the lignite-breakdown model compounds 4-phenoxybenzoic acid (which was growth inhibitory), and phenetole and 9-10-dibutoxyanthracene (neither of which inhibited growth), and showed ∼20\% of genes up-regulated by one or more of these compounds. The analysis highlights candidates for characterization and engineering enzyme over-expressing T. cf. simile strains with potentially improved degradation capacity, e.g., laccases and peroxidases, or tolerance and catabolism of breakdown products, e.g., cytochrome P450s, and ring cleavage dioxygenases.},

The whole mitogenomes of these two species (first report for the subgenus Bulladacus) possess 37 genes (13 protein-coding genes – PCGs, 2 rRNA and 22 tRNA genes). The mitogenome of B. cinnabaria (15,225 bp) is shorter than that of B. propinqua (15,927 bp), mainly due to the smaller size of the control region and intergenic spacers in B. cinnabaria. Molecular phylogeny based on mitochondrial genes (mt-genes) reveals two clades of the genus Bactrocera: one comprising the subgenus Bactrocera and the other comprising the subgenera Bulladacus, Daculus, Tetradacus and unassigned Bactrocera sp. ‘yunnanensis’. The subgenera represented by two or more taxa are monophyletic. B. (Bulladacus) cinnabaria forms a sister group with the subgenus Tetradacus (B. minax and B. tsuneonis) and B. sp. ‘yunnanensis’, in a clade containing also the basal sister lineage of the subgenus Daculus (B. oleae and B. biguttula). B. propinqua forms a sister group with B. ritsemai and B. limbifera in a subclade containing also B. umbrosa, B. curvifera and B. moluccensis of the monophyletic subgenus Bactrocera.

 abstract = {The activation of IP$_{\textrm{3}}$ receptor (IP$_{\textrm{3}}$R) Ca$^{\textrm{2+}}$ channels generates agonist-mediated Ca$^{\textrm{2+}}$ signals that are critical for the regulation of a wide range of biological processes. It is therefore surprising that CRISPR induced loss of all three IP$_{\textrm{3}}$R isoforms (TKO) in HEK293 and HeLa cell lines yields cells that can survive, grow and divide, albeit more slowly than wild-type cells. In an effort to understand the adaptive mechanisms involved, we have examined the activity of key Ca$^{\textrm{2+}}$ dependent transcription factors (NFAT, CREB and AP-1) and signaling pathways using luciferase-reporter assays, phosphoprotein immunoblots and whole genome transcriptomic studies. In addition, the diacylglycerol arm of the signaling pathway was investigated with protein kinase C (PKC) inhibitors and siRNA knockdown. The data showed that agonist-mediated NFAT activation was lost but CREB activation was maintained in IP$_{\textrm{3}}$R TKO cells. Under base-line conditions transcriptome analysis indicated the differential expression of 828 and 311 genes in IP$_{\textrm{3}}$R TKO HEK293 or HeLa cells, respectively, with only 18 genes being in common. Three main adaptations in TKO cells were identified in this study: 1) increased basal activity of NFAT, CREB and AP-1; 2) an increased reliance on Ca$^{\textrm{2+}}$- insensitive PKC isoforms; and 3) increased production of reactive oxygen species and upregulation of antioxidant defense enzymes. We suggest that whereas wild-type cells rely on a Ca$^{\textrm{2+}}$ and DAG signal to respond to stimuli, the TKO cells utilize the adaptations to allow key signaling pathways (e.g., PKC, Ras/MAPK, CREB) to transition to the activated state using a DAG signal alone.},

The aims of this study were to characterize SARS-CoV-2 from wastewater samples, and to identify variants of concern present in samples collected from wastewater treatment plants in South African urban metros from April 2021 to January 2022. A total of 325 samples were collected from 15 wastewater treatment plants. Nucleic acids were extracted from concentrated samples, and subjected to amplicon-based whole genome sequencing. To identify variants of concerns and lineages, we used the Freyja tool ( https://github.com/andersen-lab/Freyja ), which assigns each sample with the prevalence of each variant present. We also used signature mutation analysis to identify variants in each wastewater treatment site. A heatmap was generated to identify patterns of emerging mutations in the spike gene using Excel conditional formatting. Using the Freyja tool, the Beta variant was detected and became predominate from April to June 2021 followed by the Delta variant and lastly the Omicron variant. Our heatmap approach was able to identify a pattern during the changes of predominate variant in wastewater with the emergence of mutations and the loss of others. In conclusion, sequencing of SARS-CoV-2 from wastewater largely corresponded with sequencing from clinical specimens. Our heatmap has the potential to detect new variants prior to emergence in clinical samples and this may be particularly useful during times of low disease incidence between waves, when few numbers of positive clinical samples are collected and submitted for testing. A limitation of wastewater sequencing is that it is not possible to identify new variants, as variants are classified based on known mutations in clinical strains.},

Here we show that wastewater sequencing analyses are temporally concordant with clinical genomic surveillance and reveal the presence of multiple lineages not detected by clinical surveillance. We show that wastewater genomics can support SARS-CoV-2 epidemiological investigations by reliably recovering the prevalence of local circulating variants, even when clinical samples are not available.

 abstract = {Nematode-trapping fungi (NTF) are a large and diverse group of fungi, which may switch from a saprotrophic to a predatory livestyle if nematodes are present. Different fungi have developed different trapping devices, ranging from adhesive cells to constricting rings. After trapping, fungal hyphae penetrate the worm, secrete lytic enzymes and form a hyphal network inside the body. We sequenced the genome of Duddingtonia flagrans, a biotechnologically important NTF used to control nematode populations in fields. The 36.64 Mb genome encodes 9,927 putative proteins, among which are more than 638 predicted secreted proteins. Most secreted proteins are lytic enzymes, but more than 200 were classified as small secreted proteins ({\textless} 300 amino acids). 117 putative effector proteins were predicted, suggesting interkingdom communication during the colonization. As a first step to analyze the function of such proteins or other phenomena at the molecular level, we developed a transformation system, established the fluorescent proteins GFP and mCherry, adapted an assay to monitor protein secretion, and established gene-deletion protocols using homologous recombination or CRISPR/Cas9. One putative effector protein, PefB, was transcriptionally induced during the interaction. We show that the mature protein is able to be imported into nuclei in C. elegans cells. In addition, we studied trap formation and show that cell-to-cell communication is required for ring closure. The availability of the genome sequence and the establishment of many molecular tools will open new avenues to studying this biotechnologically relevant nematode-trapping fungus.},

 abstract = {Switch defective/sucrose non-fermentable (SWI/SNF) chromatin remodeling complexes are multi-subunit machines that play vital roles in the regulation of chromatin structure and gene expression. However, the mechanisms by which SWI/SNF complexes recognize their target loci in plants are not fully understood. Here, we show that the Arabidopsis thaliana bromodomain-containing proteins BRD1, BRD2, and BRD13 are core subunits of SWI/SNF complexes and critical for SWI/SNF genomic targeting. These three BRDs interact directly with multiple SWI/SNF subunits, including the BRAHMA (BRM) catalytic subunit. Phenotypic and transcriptomic analyses of the brd1 brd2 brd13 triple mutant revealed that these BRDs act largely redundantly to control gene expression and developmental processes that are also regulated by BRM. Genome-wide occupancy profiling demonstrated that these three BRDs extensively colocalize with BRM on chromatin. Simultaneous loss of function of three BRD genes results in reduced BRM protein levels and decreased occupancy of BRM on chromatin across the genome. Furthermore, we demonstrated that the bromodomains of BRDs are essential for genomic targeting of the BRD subunits of SWI/SNF complexes to their target sites. Collectively, these results demonstrate that BRD1, BRD2, and BRD13 are core subunits of SWI/SNF complexes and reveal their biological roles in facilitating genomic targeting of BRM-containing SWI/SNF complexes in plants.},

However, to meet the increasingly high computational demands of non-programming experts, a user-friendly, scalable, and accessible online platform for analyzing scRNA-seq data is urgently needed. Here, we have developed a web-based platform GRACE (GRaphical Analyzing Cell Explorer) (http://grace.flowhub.com.cn or http://grace.jflab.ac.cn:28080) that enables online massive single-cell transcriptome analysis, improving interactivity and reproducibility using high-quality visualization frameworks. GRACE provides easy access to interactive visualization, customized parameters, and publication-quality graphs. Furthermore, it comprehensively integrates preprocessing, clustering, developmental trajectory inference, cell-cell communication, cell-type annotation, subcluster analysis, and pathway enrichment. In addition to the website platform, we also provide a Docker version that can be easily deployed on private servers. The source code for GRACE is freely available at (https://github.com/th00516/GRACE). Documentation and video tutorials are accessible from website homepage (http://grace.flowhub.com.cn). GRACE can analyze massive scRNA-seq data more flexibly and be accessible to the scientific community. This platform fulfills the major gap that exists between experimental (wet lab) and bioinformatic (dry lab) research.},

 abstract = {Nodules harbour microbial communities composed of rhizobia and other lower-abundance bacteria. These non-rhizobial bacteria can promote plant growth. However, their genomic diversity and how this relates to their plant growth-promoting traits remain poorly investigated. Here, we isolated 14 Pseudomonas strains from the nodules of Lotus plants, sequenced their genomes, analysed their genomic and phylogenetic diversity, and assessed their ability to promote plant growth. We identified five distinct species, including a novel species named Pseudomonas monachiensis sp. nov., with strain PLb12AT, as the type strain. Genome analysis of these nodule-isolated Pseudomonas revealed an abundance of genes associated to plant growth-promoting traits, especially auxin-related genes, compared to closely related type strains. In accordance, most nodule-isolated Pseudomonas strains enhanced shoot growth of Lotus burttii, while only some promoted root growth or early onset of root hair proliferation. However, none of the strains significantly affected the ability to form nodules. Overall, our findings highlight the genotypic diversity and the plant growth-promoting potential of nodule-isolated Pseudomonas and underscore their possible applications in mixed inocula with rhizobia.},

 abstract = {The functions of integrins are tightly regulated via multiple mechanisms including trafficking and degradation. Integrins are repeatedly internalized, routed into the endosomal system and either degraded by the lysosome or recycled back to the plasma membrane. The ubiquitin system dictates whether internalized proteins are degraded or recycled. Here, we use a genetic screen and proximity-dependent biotin identification to identify deubiquitinase(s) that control integrin surface levels. We find that a ternary deubiquitinating complex, comprised of USP12 (or the homologous USP46), WDR48 and WDR20, stabilizes β1 integrin (Itgb1) by preventing ESCRT-mediated lysosomal degradation. Mechanistically, the USP12/46-WDR48-WDR20 complex removes ubiquitin from the cytoplasmic tail of internalized Itgb1 in early endosomes, which in turn prevents ESCRT-mediated sorting and Itgb1 degradation.},

@article{yuan_ezh2_2022,
 abstract = {Inflammasome contributes to the pathogenesis of various inflammatory diseases, but the epigenetic mechanism controlling its activation remains elusive. Here, we found that the histone methyltransferase Ezh2 mediates the activation of multiple types of inflammasomes in macrophages/microglia independent of its methyltransferase activity and thus promotes inflammasome-related pathologies. Mechanistically, Ezh2 functions through its SANT2 domain to maintain the enrichment of H3K27 acetylation in the promoter region of the long noncoding RNA (lncRNA) Neat1, thereby promoting chromatin accessibility and facilitating p65-mediated transcription of Neat1, which is a critical mediator of inflammasome assembly and activation. In addition, the tumour suppressor protein p53 competes with Ezh2 for the same binding region in the Neat1 promoter and thus antagonises Ezh2-induced Neat1 transcription and inflammasome activation. Therefore, loss of Ezh2 strongly promotes the binding of p53, which recruits the deacetylase SIRT1 for H3K27 deacetylation of the Neat1 promoter and thus suppresses Neat1 transcription and inflammasome activation. Overall, our study demonstrates an epigenetic mechanism involved in modulating inflammasome activation through an Ezh2/p53 competition model and highlights a novel function of Ezh2 in maintaining H3K27 acetylation to support lncRNA Neat1 transcription.},

Scutellaria baicalensis, a traditional Chinese medicinal herb, harbors bioactive compounds with promising pharmacological properties, including potential EGFR tyrosine kinase inhibition. In this study, we employed a comprehensive approach merging cheminformatics and molecular docking techniques to investigate the glioblastoma multiforme inhibitory potentials of the bioactive compounds from the plant, with a focus against EGFR. Our findings revealed significant binding affinities ranging from −9.010 to −6.427 kcal/mol and intricate molecular interactions between compounds from S. baicalensis and the EGFR. Notably, Ganhuangenin, 5,7,2′,5′-tetrahydroxyflavone, (2R)-2-(2,6-dihydroxyphenyl)-3,4-dihydro-2H-chromene-5,7-diol, and tenaxin I showed particularly high binding affinities, with scores ranging from −9.010 to −8.649 kcal/mol. These compounds even outperformed erlotinib, a standard ligand with a score of −8.539 kcal/mol. Importantly, they interacted with key amino acid residues (Met769, Glu738, and Thr766) through hydrogen bonding. These interactions were driven by specific structural features, including aromatic rings, hydrogen bond donors and acceptors, and hydrophobic interactions and the reliability of these results was further confirmed through induced-fit docking, reinforcing the potential inhibitory effects of these compounds on the flexible protein. Additionally, all of the top-scoring compounds from S. baicalensis adhered to established drug-likeness rules, including Lipinski's criteria, Ghose's rules, Veber's guidelines, and Egan's rules. However, it's worth noting that scutellarin had some violations in these rules. Remarkably, none of the identified compounds were likely to cause hepatotoxicity, mutagenicity, or cytotoxicity, suggesting that they could be considered as safe candidates for anti-cancer agents. This multidisciplinary investigation bridges traditional herbal knowledge and modern drug discovery, offering insights into the potential of S. baicalensis bioactive compounds as novel EGFR-targeting agents. The results underscore the value of chemoinformatics and molecular docking studies in exploring natural compounds for cancer therapy, paving the way for further research in the field.},

F. occidentalis use odorant binding proteins (OBPs) to transport semiochemicals to odorant receptors to induce a behavioural response from the sensillum lymph of the insect’s antennae. This study identifies four OBPs of F. occidentalis and analyses their expression at three stages of growth: larvae, adult males and adult females. Further, it investigates the presence of conserved motifs and their phylogenetic relationship to other insect species. Moreover, FoccOBP3 was in silico characterized to analyse its structure along with molecular docking and molecular dynamics simulations to understand its binding with semiochemicals of F. occidentalis. Molecular docking revealed the interactions of methyl isonicotinate, p-anisaldehyde and (S)-(-)-verbenone with FoccOBP3. Moreover, molecular dynamics simulations showed bonding stability of these ligands with FoccOBP3, and field trials validated that Lurem TR (commercial product) and p-anisaldehyde had greater attraction as compared to (S)-(-)-verbenone, given the compound’s binding with FoccOBP3. The current study helps in understanding the tertiary structure and interaction of FoccOBP3 with lures using computational and field data and will help in the identification of novel lures of insects in the future, given the importance of binding with OBPs.

 abstract = {Breast cancer is the most prevalent and lethal form of cancer being the utmost common medical concern of women. Breast cancer etiology implicates numerous cellular protein receptors such as estrogen receptors (ER), progesterone receptors (PR), and human epidermal growth factor/receptor 2 (HER2) which turn on oncogenic cascade often attributed to certain genetic variations. Breast Cancer is thus classified into ER + /-, PR + /-, HER2 ± and Triple Negative types. This study seeks to build upon our current knowledge of HER2 + and TNBC BC types to discover novel patterns for diagnosis and prognosis. The study exploits wealth of HER2 + and TNBC transcriptome (RNA Seq) data to elucidate the key hub genes, their associated networks, pathways, stage-wise expression profile, role in prognosis and survival expectancy, and regulatory transcription factors. The study also employs machine learning models including support vector machine (SVM), XGBoost, Random Forest, k nearest neighbor (kNN), Naïve Bayes and Voting Classifier to distinguish between HER2 + and TNBC transcriptomes which is a key variable for early detection and choice of therapeutic alternatives. RNA Seq datasets consisting of 49 HER2 + and 44 TNBC breast tumor samples were retrieved and pre-processed. Differentially Expressed Genes (DEGs) along with their logFC and p-values were fetched. The KEGG (Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes) and GO (Gene Ontology) analyses of DEGs were conducted on DAVID (the Database for Annotation, Visualization and Integrated Discovery) and interaction network was constructed through Cytoscape. Ten hub genes were obtained based on maximum clique centrality (MCC), maximum neighborhood component (MNC), degree, closeness and betweenness using cytoHubba which included ACTB, ATM, ESR1, GAPDH, HNRNPK, KRAS, MDM2, SIRT1, TP53, and H3F3C (H3-5). These hub genes were found to be associated with cell proliferation, invasion and migration. Transcription factors and association of the expression profile of these hub genes with survival expectancy was also determined. Among the ML models, SVM stood out, exhibiting classification success between HER2 + and TNBC transcriptomes with an accuracy of 90\%. The findings of this study can therefore effectively aid in tracing the initial prognosis of BC and identify biomarkers for the personalized prevention, prediction, diagnosis, and treatment of BC.},

 abstract = {The mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) signaling pathway, particularly the p38 MAPK and ERK1/2, has been implicated in the pathogenesis of Parkinson's disease (PD). Recent studies have shown that MAPK signaling pathway can influence the expression of matrix metalloproteinase 9 (MMP-9), known for its involvement in various physiological and pathological processes, including neurodegenerative diseases. This study explores the modulation of MMP-9 expression via the MAPK/ERK signaling cascade and its potential therapeutic implications in the context of PD-associated motor dysfunction. Here, tolperisone hydrochloride (TL), a muscle relaxant that blocks voltage-gated sodium and calcium channels, was used as a treatment to observe its effect on MAPK signaling and MMP-9 expression. Rotenone (RT) exposure in mice resulted in a significant reduction in substantia nigra and primary motor cortex neurons, which were further evidenced by impairments in motor function. When TL was administered, neuron count was restored (89.0 ± 4.78 vs 117.0 ± 4.46/mm2), and most of the motor dysfunction was alleviated. Mechanistically, TL reduced the protein expression of phospho-p38MAPK (1.06 fold vs 1.00 fold) and phospho-ERK1/2 (1.16 fold vs 1.02 fold), leading to the inhibition of MAPK signaling, as well as reduced MMP-9 concentrations (2.76 ± 0.10 vs 1.94 ± 0.10 ng/mL) in the process of rescuing RT-induced neuronal cell death and motor dysfunction. Computational analysis further revealed TL’s potential inhibitory properties against MMP-9 along with N and L-type calcium channels. These findings shed light on TL's neuroprotective effects via MMP-9 inhibition and MAPK signaling downregulation, offering potential therapeutic avenues for PD-associated motor dysfunction.},

 abstract = {Acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) in children or adults is characterized by structural and numeric aberrations in chromosomes; these anomalies strongly correlate with prognosis and clinical outcome. Therefore, this work aimed to identify the genes present in chromosomal gain regions found more frequently in patients with acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) and ALL-derived cell lines using comparative genomic hybridization (CGH). In addition, validation of the genes found in these regions was performed utilizing RNAseq from JURKAT, CEM, and SUP-B15 cell lines, as well as expression microarrays derived from a MILE study. Chromosomes with common gain zones that were maintained in six or more samples were 14, 17, and 22, in which a total of 22 genes were identified. From them, \textit{NT5C3B}, \textit{CNP}, \textit{ACLY}, and \textit{GNB1L} maintained overexpression at the mRNA level in the cell lines and in patients with ALL. It is noteworthy that \textit{SALL2} showed very high expression in T-ALL, while \textit{JUP} was highly expressed in B-ALL lineages. Interestingly, the latter correlated with worse survival in patients.

 abstract = {Endometrial cancer is the fifth most common cancer worldwide, with one of the highest incidence and mortality rates. Its incidence is projected to increase 55\% by 2030. Currently, the techniques used for its detection are heterogeneous and can be invasive and nonspecific. In this context, omics studies have gained relevance, providing solutions that have improved patient diagnosis and prognosis. In this study, we used data from the GSE268888 study as discovery cohort and data from the TCGA consortium as a validation cohort. Expression analyses were performed to identify miRNAs overexpressed in endometrial cancer. These miRNAs were then analyzed in relation to diagnostic and prognostic clinical variables. The target genes of these miRNAs were identified using bioinformatic tools, and functional enrichment analyses were conducted with this gene set to explore their involvement in relevant oncogenic signaling pathways. We also calculated the structural topology of the miRNA-target complexes and computed their correlation coefficients. We found that hsa-miR-182 and hsa-miR-760 had diagnostic and prognostic relevance and interacted with the p53 signaling pathway. Specifically, hsa-miR-449a was associated with diagnosis, but not with prognosis. Furthermore, we found that these miRNAs share \textit{TP53INP1} as a common target gene and estimated a high probability of complex formation, along with a positive correlation between these miRNAs and \textit{TP53INP1} in more advanced stages of the disease. These findings suggest that this miRNA signature has potential to be used as a diagnostic and prognostic biomarker and could serve as a foundation for future therapeutic strategies for endometrial cancer. However, further experimental validation is needed to confirm its clinical applicability.},

 abstract = {Pathogenic Leptospira are the causative agents of leptospirosis, the most widespread zoonotic infectious disease. Leptospirosis is a potentially severe and life-threatening emerging disease with highest burden in sub-tropical areas and impoverished populations. Mechanisms allowing pathogenic Leptospira to survive inside a host and induce acute leptospirosis are not fully understood. The ability to resist deadly oxidants produced by the host during infection is pivotal for Leptospira virulence. We have previously shown that genes encoding defenses against oxidants in L. interrogans are repressed by PerRA (encoded by LIMLP\_10155), a peroxide stress regulator of the Fur family. In this study, we describe the identification and characterization of another putative PerR-like regulator (LIMLP\_05620) in L. interrogans. Protein sequence and phylogenetic analyses indicated that LIMLP\_05620 displayed all the canonical PerR amino acid residues and is restricted to pathogenic Leptospira clades. We therefore named this PerR-like regulator PerRB. In L. interrogans, the PerRB regulon is distinct from that of PerRA. While a perRA mutant had a greater tolerance to peroxide, inactivating perRB led to a higher tolerance to superoxide, suggesting that these two regulators have a distinct function in the adaptation of L. interrogans to oxidative stress. The concomitant inactivation of perRA and perRB resulted in a higher tolerance to both peroxide and superoxide and, unlike the single mutants, a double perRAperRB mutant was avirulent. Interestingly, this correlated with major changes in gene and non-coding RNA expression. Notably, several virulence-associated genes (clpB, ligA/B, and lvrAB) were repressed. By obtaining a double mutant in a pathogenic Leptospira strain, our study has uncovered an interplay of two PerRs in the adaptation of Leptospira to oxidative stress with a putative role in virulence and pathogenicity, most likely through the transcriptional control of a complex regulatory network.},

 abstract = {Pathogenic Leptospira spp. are the causative agents of the waterborne zoonotic disease leptospirosis. Leptospira are challenged by numerous adverse conditions, including deadly reactive oxygen species (ROS), when infecting their hosts. Withstanding ROS produced by the host innate immunity is an important strategy evolved by pathogenic Leptospira for persisting in and colonizing hosts. In L. interrogans, genes encoding defenses against ROS are repressed by the peroxide stress regulator, PerR. In this study, RNA sequencing was performed to characterize both the L. interrogans response to low and high concentrations of hydrogen peroxide and the PerR regulon. We showed that Leptospira solicit three main peroxidase machineries (catalase, cytochrome C peroxidase and peroxiredoxin) and heme to detoxify oxidants produced during peroxide stress. In addition, canonical molecular chaperones of the heat shock response and DNA repair proteins from the SOS response were required for Leptospira recovering from oxidative damage. Identification of the PerR regulon upon exposure to H2O2 allowed to define the contribution of this regulator in the oxidative stress response. This study has revealed a PerR-independent regulatory network involving other transcriptional regulators, two-component systems and sigma factors as well as non-coding RNAs that putatively orchestrate, in concert with PerR, the oxidative stress response. We have shown that PerR-regulated genes encoding a TonB-dependent transporter and a two-component system (VicKR) are involved in Leptospira tolerance to superoxide. This could represent the first defense mechanism against superoxide in L. interrogans, a bacterium lacking canonical superoxide dismutase. Our findings provide an insight into the mechanisms required by pathogenic Leptospira to overcome oxidative damage during infection-related conditions. This will participate in framing future hypothesis-driven studies to identify and decipher novel virulence mechanisms in this life-threatening pathogen.},

BKS has an important role in the structure of ecological community as key taxa to forming the composition and function. This study determined unique BKS candidates of the secondary forest which may not be found in burned areas. These candidates were detected in silico from the 16S rRNA gene sequence. The 16S rRNA gene sequence was determined by next-generation sequencing (NGS) method from peat soil DNA sampled from secondary forest and burned areas in the Giam Siak Kecil Biosphere Reserve, Bukit Batu (GSK-BB). BKS candidates were selected from a phylogenetic tree constructed by using MEGA version 6.06. Selected BKS was in the same cluster as secondary forest and were re-selected using BLASTn: AlignTwo or More Sequence analysis to ensure the uniqueness of the sequences. Based on the selected candidates, specific primers were designed to amplify the 16S rRNA BKS gene. Sensitivity was tested in silico using FastPCR application to ensure that candidates were only in secondary forest. There were 19 BKS candidates found in the secondary forest and not in burnt land (BKS\_SFB) that were classified into three groups. Based on the in silico PCR amplification of the 16S rRNA gene using the designed primer, we obtained two high specificity BKS candidates, i.e. BKS SFB2 (455 bp) and BKS SFB3 (473 bp). The two candidates are potential as DNA barcodes for peatland quality monitoring after burning.},

@article{zehr_patterns_2023,
 abstract = {Viruses may acquire mutations that result in a tropism shift. RNA viruses, such as Coronaviruses (CoVs), are susceptible to tropism shifts. A tropism shift occurs when a virus alters the tissue or cell type it infects, which can have important implications for disease pathogenesis, virulence, transmission, and treatment control. Tropism shifts can occur after cross-species jumps, as well as result from within-host evolution. Beyond the human host, CoVs can be highly pathogenic to a wide variety of wildlife and companion animals. A spillover event from animals to humans, resulting in a tropism shift, has occurred at some point in the evolutionary history of all three highly pathogenic human CoVs: severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV), middle eastern respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS), and severe acute respiratory syndrome 2 (SARS-CoV-2). Therefore, studying the evolution of CoVs in non-human animals may be of critical importance for pandemic prevention. This was the focus of my dissertation, to apply state-of-the-art codon models of evolution to a variety of CoV viral sequences to identify how natural selection may alter viral proteins priming them for tropism shifts. Statistical codon models can infer both which codon sites and genes have been subject to positive or negative selection, effectively differentiating signal between random mutations and those that may impact fitness. These models may also compare selection at homologous sites between different phenotypes (i.e., Spike protein sequences isolated from the gastrointestinal tract and those from macrophages) to identify where selection is acting differently between the phenotypes. In chapter 2 I examined a CoV sequence isolated from hospitalized humans in Malaysia that resembled a Canine Coronavirus (CCoV) to investigate how natural selection had shaped the Spike protein sequence in related animal CoV sequences priming it to jump into humans. In chapter 3 I compared the natural selection signals at specific codon positions in the Spike protein from sequences isolated from two separate feline tropisms (gastrointestinal and macrophage) to identity which adaptive mutations may be associated with the tropism shift and subsequent shift in virulence. This was performed on Feline Coronavirus (FCoVs), where almost 90\% of all wild and domestic cats are gastrointestinally infected with FCoVs, and infection becomes highly pathogenic as a result of the shift in tropism to the macrophages. Since intra-host evolution can impact tropism shifts, in Chapter 4 I performed a detailed high-throughout analysis of intra-host evolution of RNAseq data of Equine Coronavirus (ECoV), as well as natural selection analyses of related embecoviruses that have colonized the human host. Taken together, I report on novel signals of natural selection across viral proteins, with an emphasis on Spike, on a diverse set of CoV clades that shed light on the complexities of coronavirus evolution as it relates to tropism shifts.},

 abstract = {There are several examples of coronaviruses in the Betacoronavirus subgenus \textit{Embecovirus} that have jumped from an animal to the human host. Studying how evolutionary factors shape coronaviruses in non-human hosts may provide insight into the coronavirus host-switching potential. Equids, such as horses and donkeys, are susceptible to equine coronaviruses (ECoVs). With increased testing prevalence, several ECoV genome sequences have become available for molecular evolutionary analyses, especially those from the United States of America (USA). To date, no analyses have been performed to characterize evolution within coding regions of the ECoV genome. Here, we obtain and describe four new ECoV genome sequences from infected equines from across the USA presenting clinical symptoms of ECoV, and infer ECoV-specific and \textit{Embecovirus}-wide patterns of molecular evolution. Within two of the four data sets analyzed, we find evidence of intra-host evolution within the nucleocapsid (N) gene, suggestive of quasispecies development. We also identify 12 putative genetic recombination events within the ECoV genome, 11 of which fall in ORF1ab. Finally, we infer and compare sites subject to positive selection on the ancestral branch of each major \textit{Embecovirus} member clade. Specifically, for the two currently identified human coronavirus (HCoV) embecoviruses that have spilled from animals to humans (HCoV-OC43 and HCoV-HKU1), we find that there are 42 and 2 such sites, respectively, perhaps reflective of the more complex ancestral evolutionary history of HCoV-OC43, which involves several different animal hosts.IMPORTANCEThe Betacoronavirus subgenus \textit{Embecovirus} contains coronaviruses that not only pose a health threat to animals and humans, but also have jumped from animal to human host. Equids, such as horses and donkeys are susceptible to equine coronavirus (ECoV) infections. No studies have systematically examined evolutionary patterns within ECoV genomes. Our study addresses this gap and provides insight into intra-host ECoV evolution from infected horses. Further, we identify and report natural selection pattern differences between two embecoviruses that have jumped from animals to humans [human coronavirus OC43 and HKU1 (HCoV-OC43 and HCoV-HKU1, respectively)], and hypothesize that the differences observed may be due to the different animal host(s) that each virus circulated in prior to its jump into humans. Finally, we contribute four novel, high-quality ECoV genomes to the scientific community.},

Using PCR-based genotyping and long-read sequencing, we identified extensive diversity among msp2 size variants and sequences. Some size variants were more prevalent than others across different geographical regions, transmission intensities, and time points. These variants comprised multiple unique sequences, of which several were geographically and temporally widespread. Our study reveals greater msp2 sequence diversity than previously known, while also identifying interesting similarities in sequence and gene length across Sub-Saharan Africa. These findings support the further exploration of common msp2 variants in relation to parasite virulence and vaccine development.},

The assembly resulted in 44 contigs, with a total genome size of 36,805,277 bp and a Guanine–Cytosine content of 46.4\%. Genome-mining revealed numerous putative biosynthetic gene clusters that code for virulence factors and fungal toxins. The presence of the enzyme pisatin demethylase was indicative of the potential of Phain to detoxify its environment from the terpenoid phytoalexins produced by its host as a defense mechanism. Proteomic analysis revealed the potential survival strategies of Phain under the snow, which included the production of antifreeze proteins, trehalose synthesis enzymes, desaturases, proteins related to elongation of very long-chain fatty acids, and stress protein responses. Study of protein GH11 endoxylanase expressed in Escherichia coli showed an acidic optimum pH (pH 5.0) and a low optimum temperature (45 °C), which is reflective of the living conditions of the fungus. Mass spectrometry analysis of the methanol extract of Phain, incubated at − 3 °C and 22 °C, revealed differences in the produced metabolites. Both genomic and mass spectrometry analyses showed the ability of Phain to adapt its metabolic processes and secretome to freezing temperatures through the production of osmoprotectant and cryoprotectant metabolites. This comprehensive exploration of Phain's genome sequence, proteome, and secretome not only advances our understanding of its unique adaptive mechanisms but also expands the possibilities of biotechnological applications.},

 abstract = {Continual climate change strongly influences temperature conditions worldwide, making ectothermic animals as suitable species for studying the potential impact of climate change on global biodiversity. However, the study of how lizards distributed at different latitudes respond to climate change at the transcriptome level is still insufficient. According to the Climatic Variability Hypothesis (CVH), the range of climate fluctuations experienced by terrestrial animals throughout the year increases with latitude, so individuals at higher latitudes should exhibit greater thermal plasticity to cope with fluctuating environments. Mitochondria, as the energy center of vertebrate cells, may indicate species’ plasticity through the sensitivity of gene expression. In this study, we focused on the changes in transcript levels of liver mitochondrial protein-coding genes (PCGs) in skinks from the genus Plestiodon (P. capito and P. elegans) and the genus Scincella (S. modesta and S. reevesii) under low-temperature conditions of 8 °C, compared to the control group at 25 °C. Species within the same genus of skinks exhibit different latitudinal distribution patterns. We found that the two Plestiodon species, P. elegans and P. capito, employ a metabolic depression strategy (decreased transcript levels) to cope with low temperatures. In contrast, the two Scincella species show markedly different patterns: S. modesta exhibits significant increases in the transcript levels of six genes (metabolic compensation), while in S. reevesii, only two mitochondrial genes are downregulated (metabolic depression) compared to the control group. We also found that P. capito and S. modesta, which live at mid-to-high latitudes, exhibit stronger adaptive responses and plasticity at the mitochondrial gene level compared to P. elegans and S. reevesii, which live at lower latitudes. We suggest that this enhanced adaptability corresponds to more significant changes in a greater number of genes (plasticity genes).},

In order to determine whether the different color phenotypes of Nedyopus patrioticus require separate taxonomic status or are simply synonyms, here, the complete mitochondrial genomes (mitogenomes) of two different colored N. patrioticus, i.e., red N. patrioticus and white N. patrioticus, are presented.

Each mitogenome contained 13 PCGs, 19 tRNAs, 2 rRNAs, and 1 CR, with a lack of trnI, trnL2, and trnV compared to other Polydesmida species. All genes were located on a single strand in two mitogenomes. Mitochondrial DNA analyses revealed that red N. patrioticus and white N. patrioticus did not show clear evolutionary differences. Furthermore, no significant divergence was discovered by means of base composition analysis. As a result, we suggest that white N. patrioticus might be regarded as a synonym for red N. patrioticus. The current findings confirmed the existence of color polymorphism in N. patrioticus, which provides exciting possibilities for future research.

In the Arabidopsis root, the quiescent center (QC) acts as a stem cell organizer, signaling to the neighboring stem cells. WOX5 is a central transcription factor regulating QC function. However, due to the scarcity of QC cells, WOX5 functions in the QC are largely unexplored at a genomic scale. Here, we unveil the transcriptional and epigenetic landscapes of the QC and the role of WOX5 within them. We find that WOX5 functions both as a transcriptional repressor and activator, affecting histone modifications and chromatin accessibility. Our data expand on known WOX5 functions, such as the regulation of differentiation, cell division, and auxin biosynthesis. We also uncover unexpected WOX5-regulated pathways involved in nitrate transport and the regulation of basal expression levels of genes associated with mature root tissues. These data suggest a role for QC cells as reserve stem cells and primed cells for prospective progenitor fates. Taken together, these findings offer insights into the role of WOX5 at the QC and provide a basis for further analyses to advance our understanding of the nature of plant stem cell organizers.},

Novel rearrangements were found in the L. scaber mitogenome: trnQ -trnC and trnL1- trnP underwent short-distance translocations and the gene block rrnS-rrnL-ND1 moved to a position between ND4 and ND5, resulting in the formation of a novel gene order. The phylogenetic analysis showed that L. scaber is most closely related to S. bungii, followed by Narceus magnum. These findings enhance our understanding of the rearrangement and evolution of Diplopoda mitogenomes.},

@article{zhang_irf4_2025,
 abstract = {Natural killer (NK) cells are essential for controlling tumor metastasis, but their protective capacity diminishes when entering an exhaustion state. The mechanisms underlying NK cell exhaustion are incompletely understood. Here, we show that the susceptibility of NK cells to exhaustion is predetermined early during their development and is governed by the transcription factor IRF4. Notably, IRF4 is highly expressed in CD27−CD24+ NK precursors but is nearly absent in immature and mature NK cells. Deletion of IRF4 redirects NK cell development, enabling NK precursors to generate more mature NK cells that resist exhaustion, thereby decreasing melanoma lung metastasis. This resistance to exhaustion is evident by increased effector molecule production and decreased expression of inhibitory receptors such as TIGIT and Pik3ip1. Deleting Pik3ip1 also enhances NK cell ability to counteract melanoma lung metastasis. These findings enhance our understanding of NK cell exhaustion and have implications for preventing cancer metastasis using NK cells.},

@article{zhang_nfatc1_2023,
 abstract = {Background \& Aims
Loss of AT-rich interactive domain-containing protein 1A (ARID1A) fosters acinar-to-ductal metaplasia (ADM) and pancreatic carcinogenesis by down-regulating transcription programs controlling acinar cell identity. However, how ARID1A reacts to metaplasia-triggering environmental cues remains elusive. Here, we aimed to elucidate the role of ARID1A in controlling ductal pancreatic gene signatures and deciphering hierarchical signaling cues determining ARID1A-dependent chromatin regulation during acinar cell reprogramming.
Methods
Acinar cell explants with differential ARID1A status were subjected to genome-wide expression analyses. The impact of epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) signaling, NFATc1 activity, and ARID1A status on acinar reprogramming processes were characterized by ex vivo ADM assays and transgenic mouse models. EGFR-dependent ARID1A chromatin binding was studied by chromatin immunoprecipitation sequencing analysis and cellular fractionation.
Results
EGFR signaling interferes with ARID1A-dependent transcription by inducing genome-wide ARID1A displacement, thereby phenocopying ARID1A loss-of-function mutations and inducing a shift toward ADM permissive ductal transcription programs. Moreover, we show that EGFR signaling is required to push ARID1A-deficient acinar cells toward a metaplastic phenotype. Mechanistically, we identified the transcription factor nuclear factor of activated T cells 1 as the central regulatory hub mediating both EGFR signaling-induced genomic ARID1A displacement and the induction of ADM-promoting gene signatures in the absence of ARID1A. Consequently, pharmacologic inhibition of NFATc1 or its depletion in transgenic mice not only preserves genome-wide ARID1A occupancy, but also attenuates acinar metaplasia led by ARID1A loss.
Conclusions
Our data describe an intimate relationship between environmental signaling and chromatin remodeling in orchestrating cell fate decisions in the pancreas, and illustrate how ARID1A loss influences transcriptional regulation in acinar cell reprogramming.},

@article{zhang_replication_2022,
 abstract = {Transcription replication collisions (TRCs) constitute a major intrinsic source of genome instability but conclusive evidence for a causal role of TRCs in tumor initiation is missing. We discover that lack of the H4K20-dimethyltransferase KMT5B (also known as SUV4-20H1) in muscle stem cells de-represses S-phase transcription by increasing H4K20me1 levels, which induces TRCs and aberrant R-loops in oncogenic genes. The resulting replication stress and aberrant mitosis activate ATR-RPA32-P53 signaling, promoting cellular senescence, which turns into rapid rhabdomyosarcoma formation when p53 is absent. Inhibition of S-phase transcription ameliorates TRCs and formation of R-loops in Kmt5b-deficient MuSCs, validating the crucial role of H4K20me1-dependent, tightly controlled S-phase transcription for preventing collision errors. Low KMT5B expression is prevalent in human sarcomas and associated with tumor recurrence, suggesting a common function of KMT5B in sarcoma formation. The study uncovers decisive functions of KMT5B for maintaining genome stability by repressing S-phase transcription via control of H4K20me1 levels.},

With an aim to characterize the structural variations in Bradyrhizobium genomes during its evolution, the genomes of AIRs and the reference Bradyrhizobium strains were compared utilizing molecular biology, bioinformatics, and biochemistry techniques. The presence of symbiotic nitrogen fixation (nif) genes and photosynthetic genes, as well as components of the T3SS (Type III secretion system) and T3CP (Type III chaperone) in the genome of AIRs, was also assessed. Additionally, the origin, evolutionary history, and genes associated with the NF-independent nodulation pattern in AIRs were explored. The results indicate that horizontal gene transfer events have occurred in AIRs, and three distinct origins of AIRs were estimated: early differentiated AIRs, non-symbiotic Bradyrhizobium, and non-AIRs. In contrast to the significant genetic transformations observed in the second and third groups, the first group of AIRs displays a rich evolutionary history, exhibits high species diversity, and primarily relies on vertical transmission of nitrogen fixation and photosynthetic genes. Overall, the findings provide a fundamental theoretical foundation for gaining a deeper understanding of the phylogeny and genealogy of AIRs.},

 abstract = {Gene expression is regulated at multiple levels, including RNA processing and DNA methylation/demethylation. How these regulations are controlled remains unclear. Here, through analysis of a suppressor for the OsEIN2 over-expressor, we identified an RNA recognition motif protein SUPPRESSOR OF EIN2 (SOE). SOE is localized in nuclear speckles and interacts with several components of the spliceosome. We find SOE associates with hundreds of targets and directly binds to a DNA glycosylase gene DNG701 pre-mRNA for efficient splicing and stabilization, allowing for subsequent DNG701-mediated DNA demethylation of the transgene promoter for proper gene expression. The V81M substitution in the suppressor mutant protein mSOE impaired its protein stability and binding activity to DNG701 pre-mRNA, leading to transgene silencing. SOE mutation enhances grain size and yield. Haplotype analysis in c. 3000 rice accessions reveals that the haplotype 1 (Hap 1) promoter is associated with high 1000-grain weight, and most of the japonica accessions, but not indica ones, have the Hap 1 elite allele. Our study discovers a novel mechanism for the regulation of gene expression and provides an elite allele for the promotion of yield potentials in rice.},

The results showed that BPs caused damage to antioxidant systems in crabs. Transcriptome sequencing revealed that BP-3 and BP-1 had a greater impact on the crabs compared to the other BPs. Specifically, BP-1 and BP-3 caused severe damage to organelles and ribosomes. BP affected catalytic activity and hydrolase activity, BP-2 affected phosphoenolpyruate carboxykinase activity, and BP-4 affected tRNA aminoacylation and hydrolase activity. These findings can enhance our understanding of the ecotoxicity of BPs and may help to protect estuarine ecosystems.},

BZR1 represses gene expression by recruiting histone deacetylases, but how it activates transcription of BR-induced genes remains unclear. Here, we show that BR reshapes the genome-wide chromatin accessibility landscape, increasing the accessibility of BR-induced genes and reducing the accessibility of BR-repressed genes in Arabidopsis. BZR1 physically interacts with the BRAHMA-associated SWI/SNF (BAS)-chromatin-remodeling complex on the genome and selectively recruits the BAS complex to BR-activated genes. Depletion of BAS abrogates the capacities of BZR1 to increase chromatin accessibility, activate gene expression, and promote cell elongation without affecting BZR1's ability to reduce chromatin accessibility and expression of BR-repressed genes. Together, these data identify that BZR1 recruits the BAS complex to open chromatin and to mediate BR-induced transcriptional activation of growth-promoting genes.},

 abstract = {Abiotic stress in cucumber (Cucumis sativus L.) may trigger distinct transcriptome responses, resulting in significant yield loss. More insight into the molecular underpinnings of the stress response can be gained by combining RNA-Seq meta-analysis with systems biology and machine learning. This can help pinpoint possible targets for engineering abiotic tolerance by revealing functional modules and key genes essential for the stress response. Therefore, to investigate the regulatory mechanism and key genes, a combination of these approaches was utilized in cucumber subjected to various abiotic stresses. Three significant abiotic stress-related modules were identified by gene co-expression network analysis (WGCNA). Three hub genes (RPL18, δ-COP, and EXLA2), ten transcription factors (TFs), one transcription regulator, and 12 protein kinases (PKs) were introduced as key genes. The results suggest that the identified PKs probably govern the coordination of cellular responses to abiotic stress in cucumber. Moreover, the C2H2 TF family may play a significant role in cucumber response to abiotic stress. Several C2H2 TF target stress-related genes were identified through co-expression and promoter analyses. Evaluation of the key identified genes using Random Forest, with an area under the curve of ROC (AUC) of 0.974 and an accuracy rate of 88.5\%, demonstrates their prominent contributions in the cucumber response to abiotic stresses. These findings provide novel insights into the regulatory mechanism underlying abiotic stress response in cucumber and pave the way for cucumber genetic engineering toward improving tolerance ability under abiotic stress.},

@article{zirngibl_triose_2023,
 abstract = {Plants have evolved multiple strategies to cope with rapid changes in the environment. During high light (HL) acclimation, the biosynthesis of photoprotective flavonoids, such as anthocyanins, is induced. However, the exact nature of the signal and downstream factors for HL induction of flavonoid biosynthesis (FB) is still under debate. Here, we show that carbon fixation in chloroplasts, subsequent export of photosynthates by triose phosphate/phosphate translocator (TPT), and rapid increase in cellular sugar content permit the transcriptional and metabolic activation of anthocyanin biosynthesis during HL acclimation. In combination with genetic and physiological analysis, targeted and whole-transcriptome gene expression studies suggest that reactive oxygen species and phytohormones play only a minor role in rapid HL induction of the anthocyanin branch of FB. In addition to transcripts of FB, sugar-responsive genes showed delayed repression or induction in tpt-2 during HL treatment, and a significant overlap with transcripts regulated by SNF1-related protein kinase 1 (SnRK1) was observed, including a central transcription factor of FB. Analysis of mutants with increased and repressed SnRK1 activity suggests that sugar-induced inactivation of SnRK1 is required for HL-mediated activation of anthocyanin biosynthesis. Our study emphasizes the central role of chloroplasts as sensors for environmental changes as well as the vital function of sugar signaling in plant acclimation.},

 abstract = {Leptographium wingfieldii is a fungal associate of Tomicus piniperda (the pine shoot beetle) and pathogen of pines and this species is an agent of blue stain in sapwood on infected trees. This fungus was first reported from Europe and has been recently introduced to Canadian forests. Ten new mitogenomes have been sequenced and characterized, including seven strains of L. wingfieldii, two strains of L. procerum and one strain of L. terebrantis. The data were combined with other members of the Ophiostomatales collected from NCBI to gain more insight into the genetic diversity, evolution, and systematics of these fungi. The size of the studied mitogenomes of Leptographium species ranged from 41 to 126 kb with the number of potential mobile introns embedded within these mitogenomes ranging from 13 to 45. These data show that introns generate genetic diversity and confirms the contribution of mobile introns in genome expansion in Ophiostomatales fungi. This study also uncovered complex intron arrangements (twintrons) suggesting the potential of mobile introns generating complex ribozymes that may have implications in gene regulation.},

@article{zubaer_genome_2025,
 abstract = {Leptographium wingfieldii is an invasive fungal species in Canadian forests which was originally isolated in Europe (France and Greece). Leptographium wingfieldii and other fungi in the order Ophiostomatales (Ascomycota) are vectored by arthropods, and they can be either pathogenic to tree species or cause blue stain on sapwood in conifer (and hardwood) species. These fungi are ecologically and economically significant due to their impact on forest ecosystems and lumber industry. Whole genome sequences were obtained from Leptographium wingfieldii and related fungi (including Leptographium procerum, Leptographium terebrantis, Grosmannia aureum, Ophiostoma minus, and Ophiostoma piliferum). The mitochondrial genomes of these fungi were assembled and found to contain autocatalytic group I and group II introns, intron-encoded homing endonucleases along with intron-encoded reverse transcriptase enzymes that have applications in genome editing. These elements contribute toward the genetic diversity observed among the mitochondrial genomes studied. The study provided information to generate a mitochondrial intron landscape, identified complex intron arrangements, and demonstrated the correlation of mitogenome expansion with the number of introns. The whole genome sequence data were also analyzed with regards to the presence of nuclear genome encoded biosynthetic gene clusters (BGCs). This effort identified the presence of 205 BGCs categorized into PKS I, PKS III, NRPS, RiPPS, Terpenes, and hybrid types and these could be sources for potential antimicrobials and industrially important chemical compounds. The study provides a platform for downstream biochemical characterization and heterologous expression of the identified genetic elements, facilitating their functional annotation and explore their potential for industrial applications.},
