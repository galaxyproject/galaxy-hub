The [Galaxy Community Conference (GCC)](/gcc) is an annual conference focused on
the use and development of the [Galaxy platform](https://galaxyproject.org/) for
data analysis. **The conference brings together researchers, software
developers, and trainers from a variety of disciplines to share their
experiences, knowledge, and skills.**

The conference included talks, posters, and workshops on a wide range of topics
related to Galaxy, including analysis results, methods development, new software
features and tools, and training and outreach topics. **The GCC provides an
opportunity for attendees to learn about the latest developments in the Galaxy
platform and to connect with other members of the Galaxy community.**

**Nestled in the heart of central France**, Clermont-Ferrand is a city framed by
dramatic volcanic landscapes and rich history. Dominated by the striking black
lava-stone cathedral and surrounded by the [Chaîne des
Puys](https://volcan.puy-de-dome.fr/volcans/chaine-des-puys.html) — a UNESCO
World Heritage site of ancient volcanoes — the city offers an inspiring mix of
natural beauty and architectural wonder.

Conference participants can look forward to vibrant cultural experiences, from
strolling through charming medieval streets to enjoying lively cafés and local
gastronomy. With its dynamic university atmosphere and welcoming spirit,
Clermont-Ferrand provides the perfect setting for stimulating academic exchange
and memorable discoveries.

The **[travel page](/events/gcc2026/travel/) has more details.**

**GCC2026 is hosted by the [Université Clermont Auvergne](https://www.uca.fr/)
(UCA)**. UCA is a modern, dynamic research university born from the merger of two
prominent institutions in 2017, now unifying diverse strengths across science,
engineering, health, and humanities. With over 35,000 students and more than 40
research units, UCA is deeply integrated into local and international research
networks, committed to fostering interdisciplinary exchange and scientific
excellence.  ￼

Among other initiatives, UCA also supports the [AuBi bioinformatics
platform](https://www.france-genomique.org/platforms-and-equipments/plateforme-de-bio-informatique-de-clermont-ferrand-aubi/?lang=en),
which administers a local Galaxy instance.

The Galaxy project is thrilled to be hosted by UCA!

    <div class="card-header">GCC2026 CoFest</div>

**CoFest is a community-driven event** where participants work together on innovative projects related to Galaxy. It’s more than a hackathon—it’s a chance for everyone, regardless of background, to contribute to our vibrant ecosystem.  ￼

CoFest participants will gather around shared interests and address common topics related to those interests. It is an informal, highly interactive meeting where you get to "hack" on a topic of choice - and you can do it with others that share similar interests.

Join us at **[CoFest](/events/gcc2026/cofest/)**
