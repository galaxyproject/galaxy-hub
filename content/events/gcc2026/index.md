The [Galaxy Community Conference (GCC)](/gcc) is the premier annual gathering for
research leaders, principal investigators, and institutional decision-makers advancing
data-intensive science. **This conference provides a strategic forum for senior
researchers to influence the direction of Galaxy development, establish collaborative
partnerships, and explore how Galaxy can address institutional research priorities.**

GCC features keynote addresses from distinguished researchers, panel discussions on
funding and strategic directions, and opportunities to shape Galaxy's roadmap. **Senior
attendees gain insights into leveraging Galaxy for grant proposals, scaling institutional
infrastructure, and building sustainable research programs while networking with leaders
from top research institutions worldwide.**

**GCC2026 is hosted by the [Université Clermont Auvergne](https://www.uca.fr/)
(UCA)**. UCA is a modern, dynamic research university born from the merger of two
prominent institutions in 2017, now unifying diverse strengths across science,
engineering, health, and humanities. With over 35,000 students and more than 40
research units, UCA is deeply integrated into local and international research
networks, committed to fostering interdisciplinary exchange and scientific
excellence.

Among other initiatives, UCA also supports the [AuBi bioinformatics
platform](https://www.france-genomique.org/platforms-and-equipments/plateforme-de-bio-informatique-de-clermont-ferrand-aubi/?lang=en),
which administers a local Galaxy instance.

The Galaxy project is thrilled to be hosted by UCA!
