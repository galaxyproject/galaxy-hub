# GCC2026 CollaborationFest (CoFest!)

CoFest is a community gathering by those interested in
contributing to Galaxy's tool set, documentation, training materials, code base,
and anywhere else that expands the Galaxy ecosystem.

CoFest participants will gather around shared interests and address common
topics related to those interests. It is an informal, highly interactive meeting
where you get to "hack" on a topic of choice - and you can do it with others
that share similar interests.

CoFest will be held June 25-26, 2026, immediately following the main GCC2026
conference in Clermont-Ferrand, France. You can attend CoFest whether or not you
attend the main conference.
