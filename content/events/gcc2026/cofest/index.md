# GCC2026 CollaborationFest (CoFest!)

CoFest is a community gathering by those interested in
contributing to Galaxy's tool set, documentation, training materials, code base,
and anywhere else that expands the Galaxy ecosystem.

CoFest participants will gather around shared interests and address common
topics related to those interests. It is an informal, highly interactive meeting
where you get to "hack" on a topic of choice - and you can do it with others
that share similar interests.

CoFest will be held June 25-26, 2026, immediately following the main GCC2026
conference in Clermont-Ferrand, France. You can attend CoFest whether or not you
attend the main conference.

## Goals!

<p class="lead">
    <strong>
        The goals of CoFest are to expand the Galaxy contributor community and its ecosystem.
    </strong>
</p>

That's a short sentence, but it is very deliberately worded:

* Our **first goal is to expand the contributor community**.  This CoFest is
  first and foremost about welcoming new contributors and helping you learn the
  resources and meet the people that will help you contribute.
* The **second goal is to expand the Galaxy Ecosystem**. Not just the code, but
  the whole ecosystem. That includes training, tools, best practice workflows,
  documentation, test cases, translations, infrastructure, and yes, even code.

This is a Collaboration Fest. Not a hackathon, not a code fest, but a *CollaborationFest*.

## Project ideas

Welcome aboard! If you'd like to get involved early check out our _live document of CoFest
project ideas_ linked below.
Feel free to add to this document or join someone else's project by adding your name to the
*Participants* column.

<p class="alert alert-info">
    A good project idea for the Cofest is preferrably a collaborative one or at the very least,
    one that would benefit from in-person planning, feedback and dicussion.
</p>

### <i>Note that this is not the exhaustive list of projects for the CoFest!</i>

<p class="lead">
    <strong>
        Share your ideas and get input from Working Group Leads.
    </strong>
</p>

Show up, share what you're curious to do (doesn't have to be a fully fledged project!), get
input or support from the Galaxy Working Group leads (UI/UX, Backend, Systems, Tools &
Workflows, Testing & Hardening, GOATS).

CoFest is all about collaboration and interaction. The best ideas and solutions come from
open discussions and collective problem-solving.

## Dates & location

CoFest will be held June 25-26, 2026, immediately following the main GCC2026
conference in Clermont-Ferrand, France. You can attend CoFest whether or not you
attend the main conference.

## Registration

To attend CoFest, we do ask that you register. This will help us find adequate
space and ensure we have enough coffee and drinks.
