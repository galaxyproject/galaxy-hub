# About Clermont-Ferrand

## The City

### Between history and modernity

Perched on a hill and protected by ancient ramparts, Clermont-Ferrand is a city with an evocative atmosphere that blends a modern identity with a captivating historic center. The city is nestled in the heart of the Auvergne region, with a population of approximately 145,000. 

As the historical capital of the Auvergne region, Clermont-Ferrand perfectly balances its rich medieval heritage with a modern, innovative spirit.

On the one hand, it hosts a remarkable monument, the Romanesque Basilica of Notre-Dame-du-Port, a UNESCO World Heritage Site. The ornate and sculpted Renaissance private palaces rival the exquisitely carved Amboise Fountain in beauty, while Art Nouveau friezes adorn the 20th-century facades and shop windows. 

On the other, the city is famously the birthplace of Michelin tires and remains a hub for rubber and tire manufacturing, while also being home to a thriving tech and research sector.

The compact and walkable city center features beautiful Gothic architecture, lively squares, and a welcoming atmosphere. Students make up a significant portion of the population, contributing to a vibrant cultural scene with numerous cafés, bars, theaters, and music venues. Clermont-Ferrand is an amazing city with a rich cultural, religious, architectural, gastronomic, and sporting heritage: you'll be spoiled for choice with its museums, parks, fine restaurants, and vibrant nightlife.

### Weather in Late June

Late June in Clermont-Ferrand offers pleasant summer weather, ideal for both conference activities and outdoor exploration. Average daytime temperatures typically range from 20°C to 26°C (68°F to 79°F), making it comfortable for walking around the city and exploring the surrounding region.

The weather is generally warm and sunny, though the region can experience occasional afternoon thunderstorms characteristic of the Massif Central climate. We recommend bringing light layers, comfortable walking shoes, and a light jacket or umbrella for the occasional shower. Sun protection is advisable for outdoor activities.

The long summer days mean you'll have plenty of daylight to enjoy the city, with sunset occurring around 9:30 PM—perfect for evening strolls and outdoor dining after conference sessions.

Traditional specialties include *truffade* (a delicious potato and cheese dish), *potée auvergnate* (a hearty stew), and *pounti* (a savory cake with Swiss chard and prunes). Puy lentils from the neighboring region are another local delicacy, known worldwide for their unique flavor and texture.
