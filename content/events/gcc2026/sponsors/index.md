# Why Sponsor GCC2026?

The **Galaxy Community Conference (GCC)** is the flagship event for one of the most impactful open-source platforms in computational biology. By sponsoring GCC2026, you're investing in a global movement democratizing data-intensive research.

# Our thank you to the sponsors

We make a strong effort to seamlessly integrate sponsors and their events into
the broader GCC program, as well as promote participant engagement. Furthermore,
sponsor talks are generally scheduled immediately preceding or following a
keynote talk to maximize their attendance.
