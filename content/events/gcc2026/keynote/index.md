Rayan Chikhi is a computer scientist and group leader at Institut Pasteur, where he heads the Sequence Bioinformatics research group in the Department of Computational Biology. 
His research focuses on algorithms and data structures for large-scale analysis of biological sequences, with particular emphasis on genome assembly, k-mer-based methods, and scalable indexing of massive sequencing collections. 

Dr. Chikhi received his PhD in Computer Science from ENS Rennes in 2012. After a postdoctoral fellowship at Penn State University, he joined CNRS and later founded his research group at Institut Pasteur in 2019. He is the recipient of an ERC Consolidator Grant (IndexThePlanet, 2023-2028). 

He initiated the Logan project, an assembly and index of petabase-scale public DNA and RNA sequencing data, then used it to search the data at scale to discover new viruses and plastic-degrading enzymes.
