# GCC2026 abstracts

Presentations from the community are a core component of GCCs. These include
oral, poster, and demo presentations. All the abstracts for presentations are
are submitted by the community and go through a peer review process by the
GCC2026scientific committee before being accepted into the conference program.

GCC2026 is a Galaxy-centric conference but the topics presented can vary
greatly. Topics of interest include but are not limited to the following areas:
* Methods and pipelines for analysis of data that leverage Galaxy
* New or improved features within the Galaxy framework
* Outreach, training, and education in data science with Galaxy
* Tools and data integrated with Galaxy

**For GCC2026, all presentations must be in-person** so if you cannot attend the
conference in Clermont-Ferrand, please do not submit an abstract. By submitting an abstract,
you agree that at least one of the authors will register and present the work.

## Key dates relevant to the abstracts

| Date   | What |
| -----: | ---  |

| Apr 20  | Talk reviews returned     |

# Abstract submission guidelines

We have several guidelines that will help you craft abstracts (and then
presentations) that will resonate with GCC2026 participants.

* **Limited to 500 words.** Please be concise and to the point. Abstract
  submission is a [web
  form](https://v4.event-vert.org/en/gcc2026?form=abstracts) so no graphics or
  references are to be included.
* **Relevance to Galaxy.** Does your work use, describe, extend, deploy,
  benchmark, etc., some part of the Galaxy ecosystem? If it does not, then it
  may not reviewed.
* **Compelling.** Is the work compelling? Will GCC2026 participants find your
  presentation interesting? Does the abstract describe novel work, interesting
  results, improvements, lessons learned, and so on.
* **Open Source / Open Access.** Not all presented work / resources must be open
  source / open access, but if it isn't, then you need a compelling reason why
  it isn't. For example, if you have implemented Galaxy in a company, behind a
  firewall, then your presentation should focus on the lessons you learned, and
  any contributions that were made back into the ecosystem. An abstract that
  merely highlights an inaccessible resource is not compelling.

If you have any questions about the poster submission process, please reach out
to the [organizers](/events/gcc2026/organizers/).
