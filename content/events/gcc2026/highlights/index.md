Rayan Chikhi is a computer scientist and group leader at Institut Pasteur, where
he heads the Sequence Bioinformatics research group in the Department of
Computational Biology. His research focuses on algorithms and data structures
for large-scale analysis of biological sequences, with particular emphasis on
genome assembly, k-mer-based methods, and scalable indexing of massive
sequencing collections. Dr. Chikhi received his PhD in Computer Science from ENS
Rennes in 2012. After a postdoctoral fellowship at Penn State University, he
joined CNRS and later founded his research group at Institut Pasteur in 2019. He
is the recipient of an ERC Consolidator Grant (IndexThePlanet, 2023-2028). He
initiated the Logan project, an assembly and index of petabase-scale public DNA
and RNA sequencing data, then used it to search the data at scale to discover
new viruses and plastic-degrading enzymes.

The Galaxy Community Update provides strategic insights into Galaxy's governance,
funding landscape, and institutional adoption trends. This session highlights major
institutional deployments, successful grant outcomes leveraging Galaxy infrastructure,
and strategic partnerships between leading research organizations. Senior attendees
will learn about Galaxy's roadmap priorities, opportunities for institutional
influence on development directions, and models for sustainable Galaxy infrastructure
at the institutional level. The session includes case studies of how major research
institutions have successfully integrated Galaxy into their research computing
strategies and secured funding for Galaxy-based research programs.

The Panel Discussion convenes principal investigators, research directors, and
institutional leaders to discuss strategic challenges in scaling data-intensive
research infrastructure. Topics include funding strategies for computational
biology infrastructure, institutional models for sustainable Galaxy deployments,
approaches to multi-PI collaborative research, and navigating funding agency
requirements for open science and reproducibility. This interactive session
provides a forum for senior researchers to share experiences, discuss strategic
approaches, and engage directly with Galaxy leadership on institutional priorities
and development roadmap decisions.
