From February 4th to 6th, in Düsseldorf, Germany, members of the Galaxy team will participate in the **NFDI4BIOIMAGE All-Hands Meeting** and present their work on advancing bioimage analysis in Galaxy. This event will provide an excellent opportunity to showcase the tools, workflows, and training materials developed by the Galaxy Image Analysis Community and discuss future directions.

### Event Highlights:
- **Keynote Talks**: Inspiring talks by leading experts.
- **Sessions**: Discussions on "What can we do now that was not possible before?" and "Future steps and vision for NFDI4BIOIMAGE."
- **Poster Sessions**: Engage with cutting-edge research presented by participants, including our poster:  
   **"Advancing FAIR Image Analysis in Galaxy: Tools, Workflows, and Training"** 
   This poster will highlight how Galaxy supports FAIR principles in bioimage analysis through a growing ecosystem of tools, workflows, and training materials. Attendees can learn about interactive tools like CellProfiler, ilastik, and QuPath, as well as automated workflows designed for scalable and reproducible image analysis.
