### Agenda
Each day is divided in to 3 sessions:
* **Training session** is a zoom meeting where tutors will present the basic idea of the topic and demonstrate the data analysis on Galaxy and explain each analysis step. It is a popcorn session. Participants should relax and watch, ask questions but don't touch the keyboard.
* **Hands-on session** is the work-session. Participants will perform the analysis that they have learned during the training session. The training material and supporting hands-on videos are provided. All the questions during the hands-on session will be answered by the tutors in a slack channel. All the workshop information, training material and tutorial videos will stay online even after the workshop.
* **Q&A session**: Day ends with an extended live discussion on zoom where we all can discuss any remaining questions about the topic. This session will start at 16:30.

## Preparation
Some important steps to consider before joining the workshop:

1. Please create an account in the [European Galaxy server](https://usegalaxy.eu) 
to perform the analysis. Participants from the MPI Freiburg, please note that 
the European Galaxy server is different from the MPI Galaxy server. You will need 
to have an account on [https://usegalaxy.eu](https://usegalaxy.eu) as well.
2. We use Slack for the discussions during the hands-on session. Please follow these two steps in order to join us in Slack:
    - First, please register at the Galaxy training network Slack space: [https://join.slack.com/t/gtnsmrgsbord/shared_invite/zt-x7vinbs1-BA~Kht6N86JBhDq0uTIVdQ](https://join.slack.com/t/gtnsmrgsbord/shared_invite/zt-x7vinbs1-BA~Kht6N86JBhDq0uTIVdQ)
    - Once you are in, join our workshop channel named freiburg-galaxy-workshop-2022 by following this link: [https://app.slack.com/client/T01EL3YJPC2/C031N6QA6P3](https://app.slack.com/client/T01EL3YJPC2/C031N6QA6P3)
    - Finally, feel free to say hello to other participants.
3. For the workshop, all you need is a computer with a latest web browser.
4. Galaxy interactive tours guide you stepwise through the Galaxy user interface
and the history. They will help you to follow the Galaxy introduction, and
ensure everyone has a basic understanding of how Galaxy works. It is recommended
to go through the following two Galaxy interactive tours before beginning the
 training, but it is not mandatory.
