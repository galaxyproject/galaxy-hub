Upcoming (and past) events with Galaxy-related content.

The events listed here are also available in the [Galaxy Events Google
Calendar](https://bit.ly/gxycal).  The [Galaxy Other Events Google
Calendar](https://bit.ly/gxyothercal) lists additional events that are relevant
to the Galaxy Community, but that are not known to feature significant Galaxy
content.

Some events are part of a series:

* [Galaxy Webinar Series](/src/events/webinars/index.md)
* [Galaxy Developer Round Table meetups](/src/community/devroundtable/index.md)
* [CollaborationFests](/src/events/cofests/index.md) and [Papercuts CoFests](/src/events/cofests/papercuts/index.md)

If you know of any event that should be added to this page and/or to the Galaxy
Event Calendar, please add it here or send it to outreach@galaxyproject.org.
For events prior to this year, see the [Events
Archive](/src/events/archive/index.md).
