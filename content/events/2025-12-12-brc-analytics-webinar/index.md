Please join us for the next installment of a webinar series run by the NIAID-funded Bioinformatics Resource Centers. This webinar will demonstrate RNA-seq analysis of *Candida auris* using BRC-Analytics, replicating findings from https://doi.org/10.1038/s41564-023-01448-x who discovered SCF1—a novel adhesin that enables this emerging fungal pathogen to colonize human skin. We will walk through obtaining reference data for *C. auris* and performing differential expression analysis to identify genes like SCF1 that are dramatically downregulated in low-adhesion mutants.
This webinar (like all of them in this series) is on the second Friday of the month at 14:00 UTC (so, 10:00AM EDT), so this one is this week, December 12. You must register to attend.
