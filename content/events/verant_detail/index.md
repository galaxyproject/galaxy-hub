This workshop is designed for biologists and life scientists who want
to analyse sequence data using the Galaxy – without needing programming expertise.
Participants will learn how to perform key bioinformatics tasks.  By the end, attendees
will be able to apply FAIR and reproducible bioinformatics workflows to their own
research.  For further information and registration, please visit the [event page](https://www.dsc-ub.de/verant_detail.php?id=263)
