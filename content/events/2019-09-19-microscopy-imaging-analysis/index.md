We would like to draw your attention to the upcoming course
“Microscopy Image Analysis” organized by the Heidelberg Center for Human Bioinformatics (HD-HuB).


The course gives an introduction into the field of microscopy image analysis for cell biology and the use of software tools
for automated processing of image data. Basic methods for computer-based analysis of microscopy images are introduced such
as image preprocessing, segmentation, feature extraction, classification, colocalization, and tracking.
Concepts of software platforms with focus on ImageJ and their use for analyzing cell microscopy image data
are also taught. Workflow systems for automating image analysis pipelines are also considered (e.g., KNIME, Galaxy).
The course consists of lectures and practical sessions. Participants should bring their laptops for the practical sessions.
The target group are researchers with a background in biology or medicine
that need to analyze their data and have little or no experience in automated image analysis.

## Prerequisites

Basic knowledge in using software tools for image analysis is helpful but not mandatory 

## Learning goals

- Introduction into cell microscopy image analysis
- Application of software tools for automated analysis of image data

## Keywords

Computer-based image analysis, image preprocessing, segmentation, feature extraction, classification, colocalization, tracking

## Course fee

Participants will be charged with a course fee of 40 Euros
(to cover the lunch and infrastructure related cost). The invoice details will be shared via email.
