Luca Degradi is an Italian researcher and educator who is passionate about
molecular biology and bioinformatics. He obtained a Bachelors degree in
Agricultural Science and Technology from the Università degli Studi di Milano in
2018. His thesis on GMO perception in Italy reflects his dedication to exploring
scientific frontiers and their societal implications. Luca obtained a
Masters degree in Biotechnology for the Bioeconomy, achieving an
outstanding mark of 110/110 with honors. During his masters, he conducted
groundbreaking research on fungal genomics, with a particular focus on Fusarium
species, under the guidance of Prof. M. Pasquali. His work led to the
publication of several groundbreaking papers, including the first telomere-to-
telomere genome assembly of Fusarium musae, a pathogen that affects both bananas
and humans. Currently, Luca is pursuing a PhD at the Università degli Studi di
Milano, researching Fusarium mycotoxins to improve food safety and quality. He
is now working on the genomic differences and possible determinant of human
infection in trans-kingdom pathogens like Fusarium sp. His research demonstrates
his unwavering commitment to addressing real-world challenges through scientific
inquiry. Luca has proficiency in various technical domains, including
bioinformatics, genome assembly and annotation, and data science. He is fluent
in both Italian and English and contributes to interdisciplinary research with
his collaborative spirit and problem-solving skills. Luca is an
excellent scientist-educator who blends academic excellence with a profound
commitment to societal impact and knowledge dissemination.

Morgan Howells is a third year BSc student studying Computing & IT at The Open
University. He has a passionate interest in deep learning and its application in
bioinformatics. His final year project is focusing on leveraging large scale
single-cell transcriptomics data to train neural networks for cell type
classification. He is also currently engaged in work conducting scRNA-seq
analysis to profile and track changes in drug-resistant and sensitive cells
within prostate cancer tissues.

Ahmad Azani Othman, currently in his second year of PhD studies in molecular
microbiology at Universiti Teknologi MARA (UiTM) Malaysia, is deeply immersed in
the fascinating world of microbial diversity. His research project centers
around the external and internal (gut) microbiome of blowflies collected from
both Malaysia’s pristine reserve forests and bustling urban areas. By employing
a metagenomic approach (specifically, 16S rRNA sequencing), Ahmad aims to
compare the biodiversity and intricate interplay between blowflies and bacterial
populations.

His academic journey has been rich and diverse. He holds a Master of Science
degree in Molecular Medical Microbiology from The University of Nottingham and
earned his Bachelor of Science with honors from Universiti Kebangsaan Malaysia
(National University of Malaysia). Prior to his PhD studies, Ahmad served as a
microbiologist at the National Blood Centre in Kuala Lumpur for six years.
During this time, he led efforts in screening for pathogens related to
transfusion-transmitted infections using serology and multiplex PCR techniques.

Ahmad’s aspirations extend beyond the lab. He seeks to deepen his understanding
of genomic data analysis, particularly leveraging the Galaxy platform, and
acquire new skills and knowledge that will enhance his future research
endeavors. Networking with fellow researchers and attending training sessions
and workshops are also high on his agenda. Ahmad Azani Othman’s dedication to
unraveling the mysteries of microbial communities associated with blowflies and
his commitment to advancing scientific knowledge make him an asset to the field
of molecular microbiology.
