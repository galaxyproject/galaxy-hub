# Intro to Galaxy Development

</div>

This training is an introduction to the basics of development in Galaxy; such as the lifecycle of setting up a local Galaxy instance, making minor changes to the client or backend, and eventually seeing those changes reflected on the local application. Trainees will be given a brief overview of the client and backend infrastructure, to get a better picture of how dev changes end up on the Galaxy platform.
