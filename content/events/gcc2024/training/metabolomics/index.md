# Metabolomics, Illustrated through MS Data Processing

</div>

Data analysis in Metabolomics requires a large variety of steps, ranging from extracting information from the raw data to statistical analysis and annotation. It can be quite complex to conduct, especially when dealing with untargeted approaches. The modularity of Galaxy is an asset to perform a complete metabolomic analysis in a single environment. In this training, we will take the example of Liquid-Chromatography Mass Spectrometry (LC-MS) analysis to get an example of what is already possible in Galaxy. Training material hosted by the Galaxy Training Network will be used as a support for hands-on.
