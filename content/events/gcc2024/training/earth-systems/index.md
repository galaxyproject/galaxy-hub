# Earth Systems

</div>

The Earth System is a complex and dynamic system that encompasses the interactions between the atmosphere, oceans, land, and biosphere. Understanding and analyzing data from the Earth System Model (ESM) are essential, for example to predict and mitigate the impacts of climate change. Thus, we created a Galaxy declination for Earth System studies (earth-system.usegalaxy.eu) with dedicated models, data, tools and data visualisation. It will make Earth System modeling more accessible to researchers in different fields.
