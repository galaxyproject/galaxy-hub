# Galaxy Automated Testing

</div>

The Galaxy code base contains thousands of tests that include tests of different types (unit vs. functional vs. end-to-end; client vs. backend, etc.) that are supported by a variety of testing frameworks and libraries. In this tutorial, we will offer a small, yet representative sample of the types of tests you might write, as well as the concepts and issues you may need to be familiar with when writing tests for Galaxy code, whether as part of a new feature you are implementing, or as a standalone contribution to Galaxy’s testing code.
