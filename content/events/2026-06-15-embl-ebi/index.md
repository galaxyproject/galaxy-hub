We are happy to share the following training course on behalf of the European Bioinformatics Institute:

"We are thrilled to announce ‘Data science for life scientists: hands-on machine learning for biological data’, will run from 15 – 19 June 2026 at EMBL's European Bioinformatics Institute (EMBL-EBI), United Kingdom. This course will introduce life scientists to practical data science methods increasingly used in research, with a particular focus on statistics and machine learning, using Python as the language of choice. Participants will learn how to prepare, process, and visualise some key biological datatypes, and gain hands-on experience in training and evaluating machine learning models using publicly available data."
