# Kick off event for Galaxy NUBRI

[Galaxy NUBRI](https://nubri.usegalaxy.eu/) is a web-based, open platform of the **National University Biomedical Research Institute (NUBRI)**, National University–Sudan, operated with support from usegalaxy.eu. 
It provides cloud-hosted bioinformatics and genomics tools and workflows that make computational research accessible, reproducible, and transparent for researchers, students, and partner institutions.
During the webinar, we will introduce Galaxy in general and the subdomain NUBRI in detail. 
Moreover, we will exemplify existing workflows for Microbiome/Pathology analysis and provide an overview of training options from the Galaxy Training Network. 
If you want to learn more about the subdomain, visit [Galaxy NUBRI](https://nubri.usegalaxy.eu/) directly or read about the [launch of Galaxy NUBRI](https://nu.edu.sd/official-announcement-launch-of-galaxy-nubri/).
