Every 3 months the Galaxy Training Network organises one day dedicated to the community! **February the 13th is the next community day** and here's what's going on:

# CoFest

This CoFest's topic is: **Admin Training**! We will focus on that topic, but anyone is welcome to contribute anything they're working on :)

Anyone who would like to contribute, learn how to contribute to the Galaxy Training Material or just catch up with the community is very welcome to join.

We will coordinate via [Hangout](https://hangouts.google.com/hangouts/_/calendar/Z2FsYXh5dW5pZnJlaWJ1cmdAZ21haWwuY29t.6n6fbpoqj6s81h9aokvtim69id) (drop-in channel we will keep open the whole day) and the [GTN Matrix channel](https://matrix.to/#/#Galaxy-Training-Network_Lobby:gitter.im).

# GTN Call

The idea of these meetings is to share news about Galaxy and Training, but also just talk together. *Everyone is welcome to join!*

To accommodate different time zones and schedules, there will be 2 calls (with similar discussions) at [8am (UTC + 1)](https://arewemeetingyet.com/Berlin/2020-02-13/08:00/GTN%20meeting) and [4pm (UTC + 1)](https://arewemeetingyet.com/Berlin/2020-02-13/16:00/GTN%20meeting) via [Hangout](https://hangouts.google.com/hangouts/_/calendar/Z2FsYXh5dW5pZnJlaWJ1cmdAZ21haWwuY29t.6n6fbpoqj6s81h9aokvtim69id).

Agenda and minutes document in [this Google Doc](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1BA4TYe5snFd5866ZeF3OtuV9quhpvvfrIMn6qD2qxl0/edit?usp=sharing), please feel free to suggest your agenda items here if there is anything you would like to discuss or learn about!
