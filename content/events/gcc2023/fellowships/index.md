# GCC2023 Fellowships

GCC2023 is proud to offer a number of student fellowships to attend the
conference. However, the application deadlines for fellowships have passed.

Two types of fellowships were offered:
- **3 in-person fellowships**: this will cover the conference and CoFest
  registration, conference dinner, up to 4 nights of hotel stay, and up to
  AU$500 in travel costs. Food and any travel expenses in excess of AU$500 will
  be the responsibility of the awardee. To apply for this type of fellowship,
  you must submit an abstract for a short or long talk.
- **10 virtual fellowships**: this will cover the cost of virtual conference
  registration. To apply for this type of fellowship, you must submit an
  abstract for a poster or demo and be present online during your scheduled
  poster or demo session to interact with the attendees.

The fellowships are made available by an anonymous donor, with much appreciation
from the conference organizers and the students.
