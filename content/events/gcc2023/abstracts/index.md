# GCC2023 Abstracts

Presentations from the community are a core component of Galaxy Community
Conferences.  These include long talks, short talks, poster presentations, and
demo presentations.  All of these are submitted by the community and go through
a peer review process before being accepted for the program.

Abstract submission deadlines have passed; you can still submit an idea for a
[BoF](#birds-of-a-feather-bof-sessions).

By submitting an abstract for a short of long talk, you agree that at least one
of the authors will register and present the work in-person at GCC2023. Posters
or demos can be presented virtually and at least one of the authors must
register and be available on Zoom/Slack during their scheduled session.


## Key dates relevant to the abstracts

| Date   | What |
| -----: | ---  |
| ~~Feb 24~~ | Abstract submission opens |
| ~~Apr 14~~ | Abstracts due for short and long talks (extended from April 3) |

| ~~Jul 1~~  | Deadline for submitting slides for your talk to the organizers |


## Poster details

Posters at GCC2023 will be presented in a digital format, on large, TV-sized
monitors (image below). To accommodate this format, **you must use [this
Powerpoint presentation
template](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1VtwTMaEB-GnRb-XR6MQjpLCcdg7Uzz5f/edit?usp=sharing&ouid=100125360277624035474&rtpof=true&sd=true)**
to create your poster. Make a copy of the Powerpoint file and build your poster.
Once you created the poster, use the poster title as the file name and upload a
PNG or JPG version of the file to this [Google Drive
folder](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1G7oFQyjtcZ6yLK7wt8Njg7sBa777d1BO?usp=sharing)
(you will need to sign in using a Google ID). If you have multiple slides, please
export those as separate PNG files and save them to a folder.

Complete details about creating a poster from the venue IT are available in
[this
PDF](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1hrPtuuvvhkbEt1eoFIlh9JKAS8ncDDSH/view?usp=sharing).


### Virtual poster presenters

For those that will not attend GCC2023 in person but are presenting a poster, we ask
you do the following 2 things to help increase the impact of your poster:
1. Upload your poster to the conference Slack (see below)
2. Create a ~90 second video where you give a quick overview of the poster
3. If you plan on being available during your poster session, set up a virtual meeting link

Please do both of these steps no later than July 9.

To start, please first join the [conference
Slack](https://join.slack.com/t/gcc2023/shared_invite/zt-1ptuyxw02-QHSHuHdyogdhSY~dxqnTXg).
Then join the the [#poster-chat
channel](https://gcc2023.slack.com/archives/C058E0U8UC9) and upload your poster.
Feel free to write a sentence or two describing the poster. Meanwhile, everyone
will use this channel for (asynchronous) communication about the posters so
please initiate and monitor activity.

For the short video, this is your opportunity to share enthusiasm for your work
and give the poster a persona. The video is intended as an overview to capture
attention so there is no need (or time) to go into every detail. The goal is to
initiate a conversation in Slack after someone has watched your video. So go
ahead, practice your [elevator
pitch](https://www.thebalancemoney.com/elevator-speech-examples-and-writing-tips-2061976)
and create the video. Once you have it, upload it to Slack (best to do
this as a threaded reply with your poster message so they are kept together).

Although not a requirement (timezones can be challenging), if you are available
during your [scheduled poster
session](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1xJVtNlN3D0yEZceoPb0CcdxtXP0Rx0FUo_ixU38wqlA/edit#heading=h.iqd2fy2pxc1h),
we encourage you to create a virtual meeting (eg, Zoom, Meet, etc) and post a
link in the [#poster-chat
channel](https://gcc2023.slack.com/archives/C058E0U8UC9) on Slack. Participants
can then use this link to connect via their phones and chat to you about your
poster.

</div>


## Demo details

Demos will be held alongside posters. There will be tables available to place
your laptop. Beyond that, it is entirely up to you how you organize the demo.


## Talk details

Slides for your talk will be projected on a screen in the 16:10 format.

Long talks will be 15 minutes total (including any questions and answers from
the audience). Short talks will be 7 minutes total.

Because GCC2023 is a hybrid event with virtual participants, the organizers will
need to ensure all the slides for talks are uniformly available for remote
attendees. Hence, **we ask that you create your slides in [Google
Slides](https://slides.google.com) and share the slide deck with *anyone with
the link* (in view-only mode), and provide a link in [this
spreadsheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/13Cs1ZgUkxN3Al9tfmNFzDYgxH7T-sa6YS6_vppMhJJE/edit#gid=0)**.


# Birds of a Feather (BoF) sessions

Birds of a Feather, or BoF, sessions are informal gatherings during GCC that
allow participants to discus topics of interest. These are free-form events
that are organized by the participants and can take any form you'd like (eg,
presentations, brainstorming, architecture drawing, etc.).

**Interested in organizing a BoF? [Fill out this
form](https://forms.gle/UU6o9bT329kP9HS7A)** with some details so we can add it
to the schedule and help advertise. Also, peep an open mind and feel free to
propose fun activities as well, such as an evening run or a city tour.


# Abstract guidelines

We have several guidelines that will help you craft abstracts (and then
presentations) that will resonate with GCC2023 participants.

* **Limited to 500 words.** Please be concise and to the point. Abstract
  submission is a web form so no graphics or references are to be included.
* **Relevance to Galaxy.** Does your work use, describe, extend, deploy,
  benchmark, etc., some part of the Galaxy ecosystem? If it does not, then it
  may not reviewed.
* **Compelling.** Is the work compelling? Will GCC2023 participants find your
  presentation interesting? Does the abstract describe novel work, interesting
  results, improvements, lessons learned, and so on.
* **Open Source / Open Access.** Not all presented work / resources must be open
  source / open access, but if it isn't, then you need a compelling reason why
  it isn't. For example, if you have implemented Galaxy in a company, behind a
  firewall, then your presentation should focus on the lessons you learned, and
  any contributions that were made back into the ecosystem. An abstract that
  merely highlights an inaccessible resource is not compelling.
* **Project Update.** If an abstract is a project update for a project that has
  previously been presented at a GCC, then it needs to describe a significant
  update to be considered for a talk. Minor updates submitted as talks will be
  offered a poster or demo spot.


# Option to publish in F1000 Galaxy gateway

Following GCC2023, you'll have an option to publish your slides or poster in the
[F1000 Galaxy gateway](https://f1000research.com/gateways/galaxy/). Besides
being a great collection of Galaxy-related content, each published artifact gets
a [DOI](https://www.doi.org/), making it easier to reference in the future.


# Questions?

Got questions about abstracts, abstract submission, or BoFs? Ask the [Scientific Program
Committee](https://galaxyproject.org/events/gcc2023/organizers/#scientific-program-committee).
