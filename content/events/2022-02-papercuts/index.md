*Paper cuts are annoying but easy to fix friction points. [Paper cuts CoFests](/events/cofests/papercuts/) are virtual, global, day-long events that improve the Galaxy ecosystem by addressing these issues.  They are also an opportunity for new contributors to become better connected with the Galaxy community.*

The February PaperCuts CoFest will be held in conjunction with the [February Galaxy Training Network (GTN) CoFest day](https://github.com/galaxyproject/training-material/issues/1712). Want to improve Galaxy, and get involved with Galaxy? Please join us.

**Goals**

* Make the Galaxy experience be a pleasure and be productive by removing and reducing irritants.
* Grow the Galaxy *contributor* community by holding regular events.
* Identify easy but informative issues to fix.
* Work together and enjoy the community.
* Dedicate time together for bug-fixing.
* Make reducing paper cuts fun.

This will be a 24h event, spanning all time zones with our worldwide community. We'll start at 09:00 Melbourne time, and end at 16:00 Portland time.

## Interested?

On Papercuts Day, please __join us on [Matrix](https://matrix.to/#/#galaxyproject_Lobby:gitter.im)__ (all day). If you don't have a GitHub or Matrix (or Elements/Matrix) account yet, then set them up (in that order).


# Before the event

If you are a Galaxy user or admin, you can create, or tag existing GitHub issues for any irritating, but likely easily fixed bugs (make a guess). These can be in any part of Galaxy, not just the core engine, and includes training, documentation, and other software.
