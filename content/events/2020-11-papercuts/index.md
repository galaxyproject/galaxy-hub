*Paper cuts are annoying but easy to fix bugs.*

This event is a recurring, day-long and worldwide *collaboration fest*, dedicated to reducing Papercuts in the Galaxy ecosystem.

The first Galaxy Paper Cuts day in October was a smashing success at identifying paper cut issues, fixing paper cut issues, and in welcoming new contributors to the Galaxy contributor community.

**Goals**

* Make the Galaxy experience be a pleasure and be productive by removing and reducing irritants.
* Grow the Galaxy contributor community by holding regular events.
* Identify easy but informative things to fix.
* Work together and enjoy the community.
* Dedicate time together for bug-fixing.
* Make reducing paper cuts fun.

This will be a 24h event, spanning all time zones with our worldwide community. We'll start at 9 AM Melbourne time, and end at 6 PM Portland time.

## Interested?

Interested? Then please join us on a call (and on [Matrix](https://matrix.to/#/#galaxyproject_Lobby:gitter.im)) and we will get you on board.

### Before the event

If you are a Galaxy user or admin, you can create, or tag existing GitHub issues for any irritating, but likely easily fixed bugs (make a guess). These can be in any part of Galaxy, not just the core engine, and includes training, documentation, and other software.

If you don't have a GitHub or Matrix account yet, then set them up (in that order).

If you have time, and want to learn more about contributing you are encouraged to review:

* [A collection of short videos](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLNFLKDpdM3B8Ro-V0mZboQjj40RimRZ8n), highlighting how to do common useful tasks during Paper Cuts and beyond.
* [Development in Galaxy tutorials](https://training.galaxyproject.org/training-material/topics/dev/).
* [Contributing to the Galaxy Training Material tutorials](https://training.galaxyproject.org/training-material/topics/contributing/).
* [Galaxy on GitHub](https://github.com/galaxyproject) - see what projects are supported and find the one that speaks to you. Pay particular attention to each project's CONTIBUTING.md files.

### During the event

We will have video calls throughout the day and be on Matrix for chat all day long. Please take advantage of both to communicate with your collaborators around the world.

### After the event

*Get those pull requests in! And address anything from the review! And become more involved in the Galaxy code, training, and documentation base!*

### Communication

Communication will happen through GitHub, [Matrix channels](https://matrix.to/#/#galaxyproject_Lobby:gitter.im) and [Zoom](#join-us-in-our-regular-video-calls). Links will be posted here before the event.
