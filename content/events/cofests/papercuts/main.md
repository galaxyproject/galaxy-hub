# How to get involved with Papercuts CoFests?

Papercuts CoFests are held every three months (see below), and it's easy to get involved in the very next one.

-   **Before**
    -   Each Papercuts event page has links to issues. in different parts of Galaxy, that have been flagged by experienced community members as being "fixable during a Papercuts."
    -   Figure out which of these projects interest you the most.
    -   Do some (even a little bit is useful) on that project.
    -   Check the event page for more information on that particular event. Depending on what issues we're hoping to tackle, there may be some scheduled Zoom calls or collaboration materials.
-   **During**
    -   Join the discussion on [Matrix](https://matrix.to/#/#galaxyproject_Lobby:gitter.im).
    -   People on Matrix will provide guidance and resources, and help connect you to folks who specialize in the area you are interested in.
    -   Ask for help! Collaborate! Work together!
    -   Join the GTN CoFest Calls! (And any other Zoom calls that we may have for the event.)

    -   [Stay involved.](https://galaxyproject.org/community/contributing/) Galaxy has lots of ways to get involved. Leverage your newly acquired knowledge to ask for help, and to help others.
    -   Get your fixes integrated! You may or may not get in a fix integrated during the official Papercuts day. If you don't, then stick with it until you have the final polish on it, so it can be merged.
    -   Join us again for the next Papercuts.

# Guide for WGs: Hosting a Papercuts event

If your working group is the host for the next papercuts event, here is what we need from you for the event to be successful:

-   Find **5-10 small to medium issues** that you want to see worked on. Triage them a bit to make sure a contributor has any pertinent information they may need to be successful.
-   Find **1 or 2 bigger topics** that you want a lot of feedback or collaboration on, if applicable.
-   Decide if you want to have video calls or not. If you do, we can pre-schedule them ahead of time.
-   **Be available.** Talk about who's going to take point on certain issues or time zones.
-   Make the event yours. We welcome help with design decisions for the advertisements, formatting on the event page, etc.
-   Have fun!
