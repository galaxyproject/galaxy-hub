Papercuts events are [Galaxy CoFests](/events/cofests/) that address annoying, but easy to fix bugs ("paper cuts").  *Papercut CoFests* run for 24 hours (following the sun) and are collaborative events, dedicated to

* **Making the Galaxy experience be a pleasure and be productive by removing and reducing irritants.**
* **Growing the Galaxy *contributor* community by holding regular events.**
* Identify easy but informative things to fix.
* Work together and enjoy the community.
* Dedicate time together for bug-fixing.
* Make reducing paper cuts fun.

# How to get involved with Papercuts CoFests?

First, you can register your interest.  We'll send you information and a reminder before the next event.  (Registering your interest is optional.  You can also just show up.)

<button type="button" class="btn btn-light"> **[I'm interested!](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSc-OUa9s-L9DO1RMuSeiOWts1am0eWXI9VKM9dHfKxExBS-ag/viewform)**
 </button></a>

Papercuts CoFests are held regularly (see below), and it's easy to get involved in the very next one.

* **Before**
  * Each Papercuts event page has links to issues. in different parts of Galaxy, that have been flagged by experienced community members as being "fixable during a Papercuts."
  * Figure out which of these projects interest you the most.
  * Do some (even a little bit is useful) on that project.
  * Each event has conference calls, every 3-4 hours, going around the world.  Look at the schedule and figure out which calls you can make it to.
* **During**
  * Join the discussion on [Gitter](https://gitter.im/galaxyproject/Lobby).
  * People on Gitter will provide guidance and resources, and help connect you to folks who specialize in the area you are interested in.
  * Before the next call, followup with others on Galaxy chat channels.
  * Be on the next call for a follow up.
* **After**
  * Stay involved. Galaxy has lots of ways to get involved. Leverage your newly acquired knowledge to ask for help, and to help others.
  * Get your fixes integrated!  You may or may not get in a fix integrated during the official Papercuts day.  If you don't then stick with it until you have the final polish on it, and it goes in.
  * Tell everyone you meet that you are now a Galaxy Project contributor.
  * Join us again for the next Papercuts.
