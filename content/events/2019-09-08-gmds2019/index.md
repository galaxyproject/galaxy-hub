In this training course, we provide a summary of the applications of Next Generation Sequencing (NGS) technologies in the clinical context. These are presented through a hands-on session on RNA-Seq data analysis, following a use case to study a clinical NGS dataset. Leveraging on the Galaxy environment, we guide the participants through all relevant steps for carrying out the analysis, as well as linking the obtained results with current gene-disease-related databases, or other relevant resources to highlight the clinical impact of the technology. Finally, we discuss our audience's NGS experiments, and provide advice on their NGS data analysis approaches.

## Learning goals
- Get familiar with the Galaxy framework (https://usegalaxy.eu) for carrying out scientific data analyses
- Learn methods for data exploration and quality control of NGS datasets
- Get familiar with the concepts underlying genome alignment and data visualization of subsequent results

## Prerequisites
This workshop is intended for MSc/PhD students, postdocs, and researchers with a background in Life Science research.

## Keywords
Galaxy, Reproducibility, Workflow development, RNA-Seq data analysis, Visualization
