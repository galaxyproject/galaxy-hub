[Biolytix](https://www.biolytix.ch/en/) and the [Freiburg Galaxy team](/freiburg/) teamed up over the last year to develop **Galaxy**-based **workflows** for **accessible** and **scalable** detection and identification of **foodborne pathogens**, thanks to an [EOSC-Life internal grant for academia-industry collaborations](https://www.eosc-life.eu/industrycall/).

To share about the workflows and (foodborne) pathogen detection in general, we organize a 1-day **hybrid** (F2F at FHNW Muttenz, Switzerland and online), **free** and **practical workshop** on **February 2nd, 2023** to learn how to detect (foodborne) pathogens from (direct Nanopore) sequencing data using Galaxy, an **open-source** platform for **FAIR data analysis**.

In the context of the COVID-19 pandemic, there is no "zero risk" when it comes to any kind of gathering – especially events that bring groups of people together. To try to limit these risks as much as possible, the organizers team has enabled the following safety measures throughout the event. Please make sure to respect them and request support if at any given time you need it.

If you don't feel well or show any symptoms of COVID-19, please avoid joining the event. Online participation is possible at all given times. If you choose to attend in person, please make sure you:
- wear a FFP2 mask during the conference sessions,
- clean your hands frequently,
- cover coughs and sneezes with bent elbow or tissues,
- try to keep distance from other people when sitting.

# Before the workshop

Some important steps to consider before joining the workshop:
1. Create an account in the [European Galaxy server](https://usegalaxy.eu) to perform the analysis.
2. Get ready for using Slack
    - Register at the [Galaxy Training Network Slack](https://join.slack.com/t/gtnsmrgsbord/shared_invite/zt-x7vinbs1-BA~Kht6N86JBhDq0uTIVdQ) space:
    - Join the workshop channel named #event-foodborne-pathogen-detection-2023
    - Say hello to other participants.
3. Bring a computer with a recent web browser
4. [Optional] Take one of Galaxy interactive tours to guide you stepwise through the Galaxy user interface and the history.

    They will help you to follow the Galaxy introduction, and ensure everyone has a basic understanding of how Galaxy works. It is recommended to go through the following two Galaxy interactive tours before beginning the training, but it is not mandatory

    - [Galaxy UI](https://usegalaxy.eu/tours/core.galaxy_ui)
    - [History Introduction](https://usegalaxy.eu/tours/core.history)
