Every 3 months the Galaxy Training Network organises one day dedicated to the community! **February 25th is the next community day** and here's what's going on:

# CoFest

Anyone who would like to contribute, learn how to contribute to the Galaxy Training Material or just catch up with the community is very welcome to join.

We will coordinate via Zoom and the [GTN Matrix channel](https://matrix.to/#/#Galaxy-Training-Network_Lobby:gitter.im).

# GTN Call

The idea of these meetings is to share news about Galaxy and Training, but also just talk together. *Everyone is welcome to join!*

To accommodate different time zones and schedules, there will be 3 calls (with similar discussions) in 3 different time zones.

# Papercuts CoFest

**The February 2021 GTN Day will be held concurrently with the [February Papercuts CoFest day](/events/2021-02-papercuts/)**, which like GTN day is a CoFest featuring community calls throughout participating time zones.  You are encouraged to participate in both.
