# Introducing Galaxy tools and Workflows in the University Library Freiburg

The Galaxy Freiburg team will introduce Galaxy (and particularly the (Digital Humanities Special Interest Group)[https://galaxyproject.org/community/sig/digital-humanities/]) to
the University Library in Freiburg.
We will discuss the applicability of Galaxy to non-machine-readable data and present examples from the Digital Humanities and Social Sciences.
