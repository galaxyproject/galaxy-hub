The Galaxy Training Network has developed an infrastructure to deliver interactive training based on Galaxy: one central place ([https://training.galaxyproject.org](https://training.galaxyproject.org)) to aggregate training materials covering many current research topics. Each topic is supported by different tutorials developed and maintained by the community via a GitHub repository: [https://github.com/galaxyproject/training-material](https://github.com/galaxyproject/training-material).

The Galaxy Training Network is organizing regular online CoFests (Collaboration/Contribution Fests) every 3 months on the 3rd Thursday for a day of the collaborative work on the training content.

**The next one will be on the 15th of November.** We plan to focus on genome annotation training; but anyone who would like to contribute on any other topics is very welcome to join.
We will coordinate via [Hangout](https://hangouts.google.com/hangouts/_/calendar/Z2FsYXh5dW5pZnJlaWJ1cmdAZ21haWwuY29t.459bpoqjjo780nm56q267ba7i8) (drop-in channel we will keep open the whole day) and [the GTN Matrix channel](https://matrix.to/#/#Galaxy-Training-Network_Lobby:gitter.im).

During the day, we plan to have a GTN meeting to discuss the recent changes and future directions.
