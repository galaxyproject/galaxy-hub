# Where is the data? 
## Managing and processing digital humanities research data to unlock its full potential 

The Love Data Week is scheduled for **February 9 to 13, 2026** and the Freiburg Galaxy Team is teaming up with the Central Data Facility and the DH lab to celebrate it!

What counts as “research data” in the humanities? 
How can we get and responsibly manage that data? Which tools let us turn manuscripts, images, or sound recordings into FAIR‑ready research assets or do even more compelling tasks? 
And where can you find them? Join us for an interactive talk that answers these questions and introduces you to different institutions at the University of Freiburg to support your research data analysis.

For more details on this and other events, please visit the **[Central Data Facility]([https://e-science-tage.de/en/startseite](https://cdf.uni-freiburg.de/en/events/2026-02-09-love-data-week.html))** event page.
