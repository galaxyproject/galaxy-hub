*Paper cuts are annoying but easy to fix friction points. [Papercuts CoFests](/events/cofests/papercuts/) are virtual, global, day-long events that improve the Galaxy ecosystem by addressing these issues.  They are also an opportunity for new contributors to become better connected with the Galaxy community.*

### Goals

* Make the Galaxy experience be a pleasure and be productive by removing and reducing irritants.
* Grow the Galaxy *contributor* community by holding regular events.
* Identify easy but informative issues to fix.
* Work together and enjoy the community.
* Dedicate time together for bug-fixing.
* Make reducing paper cuts fun.

This will be a __24h event__, spanning __all time zones__ with our worldwide community.

### Interested?

On Papercuts Day, please __join us on [Matrix](https://matrix.to/#/#galaxyproject_Lobby:gitter.im)__ (all day), and on __3 calls__ held throughout the day (arranged to cover the globe).

If you don't have a GitHub or Matrix (or Elements/Matrix) account yet, then set them up (in that order).


# Before the event

If you are a Galaxy user or admin, you can create, or tag existing GitHub issues for any irritating, but likely easily fixed bugs (make a guess). These can be in any part of Galaxy, not just the core engine, and includes training, documentation, and other software.

### Resources

If you have time, and want to learn more about contributing you are encouraged to review:
