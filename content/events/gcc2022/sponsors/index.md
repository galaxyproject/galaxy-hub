# GCC2022 Sponsors

Sponsors are a key part of GCC2022.  They are potential partners in your
success, and sponsors make this conference affordable and accessible.

Please join everyone during the sponsor talks to learn more about how their
services relate to the Galaxy community and software. Sponsor talks are
generally scheduled at the start of the last session with accepted talks. See
[the program](https://gcc2022.sched.com/) for exact times.
