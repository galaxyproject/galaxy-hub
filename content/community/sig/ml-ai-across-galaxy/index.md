# Welcome to **MALIC – Machine Learning and Artificial Intelligence across the Galaxy Community!**  
*The Galaxy-wide community for ML & AI across disciplines*

**MALIC** is a stylized name representing the key themes of our community:  
- **M** – Machine  
- **A** – Artificial  
- **L** – Learning  
- **I** – Intelligence  
- **C** – Community (across Galaxy)

**Like every Galaxy community, we have our own unique flavor!**
MALIC brings together everything related to machine learning (ML) and artificial intelligence (AI) within Galaxy.  
We connect users, developers, and trainers from diverse fields to collaborate, share, and grow together in this transformative era of AI.

**Our mission is to connect fields such as** *digital humanities*, *omics*, *ecology*, **and** *imaging*, **by sharing expertise that strengthens the Galaxy platform.**

## Could MALIC be your new home in Galaxy? Let’s find out!

We’re a growing, welcoming community of people using and developing ML/AI tools in Galaxy.  
Whether you're working with data in biology, ecology, humanities, imaging or anywhere in between, there's a place for you here!

- **Developers**  
  Are you wrapping or building ML or deep learning tools? Join us to coordinate efforts, avoid duplications and get early feedback from others in the community.
- **Users**  
  Are you using Galaxy ML tools for omics, images or texts? Share your experiences, tell us what works and what could be improved. Your feedback helps shape future tool design.
- **Trainers**  
  Are you contributing tutorials or running workshops? Help us curate and connect training resources across different use cases and domains.
- **Researchers**  
  Are you exploring new ML applications in Galaxy? Join us to benchmark workflows, improve reproducibility and exchange ideas across disciplines.

## MALIC Community Goals

Our primary goals are to:
* **Coordinate efforts** across the Galaxy ecosystem to reduce redundancy in tools, workflows, and training.
* **Share our work** from within and outside Galaxy to showcase our advancements.
* **Support each other** through knowledge-sharing, troubleshooting, and collaboration.

Additionally, we strive to:
* **Develop and maintain** ML/AI tools within Galaxy.
* **Implement FAIR principles** to make workflows reproducible and reusable.
* **Expand documentation** and **training resources** for accessible learning and skill-building.

## Meetings and Communication

- **When?** We meet every third Thursday at 16:00 CET  
- **How long?** Just one hour, short and sweet!  
- **What’s on the agenda?** Tool demos, cross-domain updates, collaboration planning, and relaxed idea sharing.

- Our community connects via our dedicated [Matrix channel](https://matrix.to/).
- Check our [Agenda](googledoc) to find out more about what we are currently doing. 

## New to ML in Galaxy?

We got you covered! These resources are perfect for beginners or returning users:

To dive into ML and AI with Galaxy, the [Galaxy Training Network (GTN)](https://training.galaxyproject.org) offers a wide range of tutorials. These tutorials guide you step by step through core ML, statistics and AI concepts, tools, and workflows. They help you gain hands-on experience and build reproducible analyses using Galaxy.

## A dedicated Galaxy subdomain

[ml.usegalaxy.eu](https://ml.usegalaxy.eu) is a Galaxy instance designed specifically for machine learning and AI.  
It offers a rich set of tools and workflows optimized for interactive and reproducible analysis of imaging and other complex data.
