# Welcome to **MALIC – Machine Learning and Artificial Intelligence across the Galaxy Community!**  
*The Galaxy-wide community for ML & AI across disciplines*

**MALIC** is a stylized name representing the key themes of our community:  
- **M** – Machine  
- **A** – Artificial  
- **L** – Learning  
- **I** – Intelligence  
- **C** – Community (across Galaxy)

**Like every Galaxy community, we have our own unique flavor!**
MALIC brings together everything related to machine learning (ML) and artificial intelligence (AI) within Galaxy. We connect users, developers, and trainers from diverse fields to collaborate, share, and grow together in this transformative era of AI.

**Our mission is to connect fields such as _digital humanities_, _omics_, _ecology_, and _imaging_, by sharing expertise to strengthen the Galaxy platform.**

## AI-Assisted Programming

Through Galaxy Jupyter Notebooks, researchers can harness ChatGPT as a programming assistant. [This integration](https://galaxyproject.org/news/2023-08-14-chat-gpt/) simplifies code generation and debugging.

## AI-Powered Model Inference

Galaxy integrates a range of pre-trained AI models to support different inference tasks, from biological systems modeling to biomedical image analysis. These models are accessible through dedicated tools and resources:

### BioModels for systems biology

The [**BioModels**](https://www.ebi.ac.uk/biomodels/) repository provides computational models of biological processes.

Galaxy integrates a [**dedicated tool**](https://usegalaxy.eu/root?tool_id=toolshed.g2.bx.psu.edu/repos/bgruening/biomodels_biomd0000001066/biomodels_biomd0000001066/1.1) that leverages a **pre-trained Random Forest machine learning model** (available in **ONNX format** within a Docker container) to predict immune checkpoint blockade efficacy across multiple cancer patient cohorts.

This enables researchers to run predictive models directly within Galaxy—without the need for local infrastructure.

> _Learn more in the [BioModels tool blog post](https://galaxyproject.org/news/2023-11-29-bio-m-ltool/)._

### BioImage.IO models for image analysis

Galaxy also supports **[BioImage.IO](https://bioimage.io/#/)**, a repository of deep learning models for biomedical image processing (e.g., segmentation, classification). Using the **[BioImage Inference tool](https://usegalaxy.eu/root?tool_id=toolshed.g2.bx.psu.edu/repos/bgruening/bioimage_inference/bioimage_inference/2.4.1+galaxy3)**, users can:

- Load models directly from BioImage.IO for inference
- Apply state-of-the-art models on microscopy data
- Access mirrored models within Galaxy for fast and efficient use
