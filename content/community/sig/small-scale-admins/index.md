# Who are we?

We are a group of admins who maintain a (small) (local) Galaxy server. Having grown out of the "Small Scale Servers" subcommittee of the [Global Galaxy Steering Committee](https://galaxyproject.org/community/steering/), our meetings are now taking place every month. We discuss issues, problems, and of course solutions we encounter as maintainers of a non usegalaxy.* instance, which very often are very specific (and not covered by the Galaxy code base). We have different backgrounds and individual experiences. We do not have the same amount of time dedicated to administering our galaxy instance.
We very much welcome new people who are just starting setting up a local Galaxy server or are only considering doing so.

# How can you contact us or join us?
We meet every month by zoom. Check our next meeting in the [Galaxy WGs Google Calendar](https://calendar.google.com/calendar/u/0/embed?src=5l6o0msfduoir59hrab0jlkocc@group.calendar.google.com) and just join.
Occasionally, we organize a BoF at GCC or regional Galaxy meetings/workshops
We have a [mailing list](https://lists.galaxyproject.org/lists/small-scale-admins.lists.galaxyproject.org/).
We intentionally do not have chat but if you have a emergency admin question, please ask it to the [matrix channel](https://matrix.to/#/#galaxyproject_admins:gitter.im)
