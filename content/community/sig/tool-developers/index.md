## 👥 Who are we?

We are developers of Galaxy tool wrappers with a shared interest in high-quality, sustainable tool development, agreed-upon maintenance responsibilities, and open collaboration. We try to support each other to increase the overall quality of our work through coordination, mentoring, and knowledge sharing.

Many of us are members of Galaxy’s [Intergalactic Utilities Commission (IUC)](https://galaxyproject.org/iuc/), but we explicitly welcome anyone seeking to improve Galaxy’s tool ecosystem and/or their own tool wrapping skills. Whether you are an experienced developer or just starting with Galaxy tool wrapping, you can participate in our discussions, learn from others, and take on meaningful tasks related to tool development and maintenance across scientific domains.
