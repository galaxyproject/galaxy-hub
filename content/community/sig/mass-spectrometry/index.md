## Welcome to the Galaxy Mass Spectrometry Community!

**An Open and Collaborative Community**

We are a vibrant and inclusive network of researchers, developers, and trainers dedicated to advancing the fields of proteomics and metabolomics. Our community is committed to fostering open, reproducible, and accessible research through the use of Galaxy.

**Our Mission**

We believe in the power of collaboration and the importance of sharing knowledge. 

Our mission is to:

- develop a set of well-documented and tested tools for the analysis of mass spectrometry data (both LC-MS/MS and GC-MS/MS),
- support researchers in their quest to understand complex biological systems using the MS. We provide both proteomics and metabolomics workflows to analyze complex MS data,
- provide comprehensive training materials describing such tools and workflows,
- facilitate a collaboration across pipelines and tools,
- conduct a research in an open and reproducible manner.

**How do we function?**

**Meetings** We meet every 2-3 months. There are two meetings in one day, one for the EU and one for AU time zone - you can choose the one that suits you more or join both! Check our **google calendar** to see when the next meeting occurs.

**Emails** We send out emails to the mailing list after each meeting, at the mid-way point between meetings, and the day before meetings as a reminder.

**Notes** We keep rolling notes on a googledoc and monitor our work in a github project.

**Chat Forum** We have a chat forum on [Matrix](https://matrix.to/#/#galaxyproject_mass-spectrometry:matrix.org), where you can discuss news and ideas or ask for a help.

## I would like to... 

## ... analyze my MS data!

You can start with the workshops related to analysis of [proteomic](https://training.galaxyproject.org/training-material/topics/proteomics/) or [metabolomic](https://training.galaxyproject.org/training-material/topics/metabolomics/) data in Galaxy.

Also, the GalaxyP team provides slides to [conference talks](https://galaxyp.org/conference-presentations/#presentations) or materials from [workshops](https://galaxyp.org/workshops/)

## ... learn more about Galaxy!

If you are completely new to Galaxy, these two tutorials are great point to start!

- [Introduction to Galaxy Analyses](https://training.galaxyproject.org/training-material/topics/introduction/)
- [Using Galaxy and Managing your Data](https://training.galaxyproject.org/training-material/topics/galaxy-interface/)

## ... develop new tools!

We keep all the source code on Github:

- General [Galaxy repository](https://github.com/galaxyproject).
- Github repository for [proteomics tools](https://github.com/galaxyproteomics)
- Github repository for [metabolomics tools](https://github.com/workflow4metabolomics/tools-metabolomics)

To start with the new tools development, check out the [development training materials](https://training.galaxyproject.org/training-material/topics/dev/) 

## ... contribute to trainings!

If you would like to create new training materials or hold a training at your institute - we obviously have a [training](https://training.galaxyproject.org/training-material/topics/contributing/) for that!
