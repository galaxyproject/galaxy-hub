Whether you are analysing texts, images, audio data or other media, **Galaxy is here to help**!


# How can you use Galaxy for Digital Humanities analysis?

Galaxy is a flexible setup, so it can leverage analysis in Digital Humanities (DH) and Social Sciences in various ways. Due to the platform's flexibility, you can create an analysis that fits your research needs and supports you with tools for easier research data management on the go. Just go to the Galaxy instance of your choice, for example, the [European Galaxy Server](https://usegalaxy.eu/), create an account and get started.

Here are some examples:

## üìÑ Publications / Examples

- See the newest [poster](https://zenodo.org/records/17016028) on how Galaxy can help researchers in Digital Humanities and Social Sciences presented at the [Historikertag 2025](https://www.historikertag.de/Bonn2025/).

- We explored Instagram posts from the Bavarian State elections provided by the [BERD Data Portal](https://www.berd-nfdi.de/data-portal/). [Read more](https://galaxyproject.org/news/2025-05-20-berd-wf/) to see how the dataset was cleaned and mined to visualise not only the most frequent words in the post to get an idea of its contents, but also extracted and mapped where most of those posts originated in just a couple of steps in Galaxy.

- Check out the [poster](https://doi.org/10.11588/heidok.00036288) on Galaxy in the Humanities that Daniela Schneider and Jan Leendertse presented at the [E-Science Days 2025](https://artifact.galaxyproject.org/news/2025-03-14-e-science-days/).
  
- A German article from Daniela Schneider and Jan Leendertse, building on this presentation, is forthcoming.

# What is available?

To make your own analysis, start by checking out the tools (the term we use in Galaxy for programs) in your Galaxy instance, for example, [Galaxy Europe](https://usegalaxy.eu/). On the website, you can access the tools by clicking on the bar on the left-hand side. The second icon there is **tools**.

## üéì Workflows and training materials

You can find an overview of the existing tutorials on the dedicated DH-section of the [Galaxy Training Network](https://training.galaxyproject.org/training-material/topics/digital-humanities/). Those are open educational resources (OER) that you can create from your workflows or reuse in teaching and training. Documentation for providing further tutorials can be accessed [here](https://training.galaxyproject.org/training-material/topics/contributing/). If you have never worked with Galaxy before, we suggest you start with our [Introduction to Digital Humanities in Galaxy](https://training.galaxyproject.org/training-material/topics/digital-humanities/tutorials/introduction_to_dh/tutorial.html).

In addition to those mentioned above, we are currently working on:
- Using OpenRefine in Galaxy to analyse data

##  üèõÔ∏è Upcoming events
