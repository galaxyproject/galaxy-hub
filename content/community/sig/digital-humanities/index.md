Whether you are analysing texts, images, audio data or other media, **Galaxy is here to help**!


# How can you use Galaxy for Digital Humanities analysis?

Galaxy is a flexible setup, so it can leverage analysis in Digital Humanities (DH) and Social Sciences in various ways. Due to the platform's flexibility, you can create an analysis that fits your research needs and supports you with tools for easier research data management on the go.

Here are some examples:

## üìÑ Publications / Examples

- We explored Instagram posts from the Bavarian State elections provided by the [BERD Data Portal](https://www.berd-nfdi.de/data-portal/). [Read more](https://galaxyproject.org/news/2025-05-20-berd-wf/) to see how the dataset was cleaned and mined to visualise not only the most frequent words in the post to get an idea of its contents, but also extracted and mapped where most of those posts originated in just a couple of steps in Galaxy.

- Check out the [poster](https://doi.org/10.11588/heidok.00036288) on Galaxy in the Humanities that Daniela Schneider and Jan Leendertse presented at the [E-Science Days 2025](https://artifact.galaxyproject.org/news/2025-03-14-e-science-days/).

- A German article from Daniela Schneider and Jan Leendertse, building on this presentation, is forthcoming.

# What is available?

To make your own analysis, start by checking out the tools (the term we use in Galaxy for programs) in your Galaxy instance, for example, [Galaxy Europe](https://usegalaxy.eu/). On the website, you can access the tools by clicking on the bar on the left-hand side. The second icon there is **tools**. You can search there or click on the arrows and search for more details in the help text.
You can combine various Galaxy tools into [workflows](https://training.galaxyproject.org/training-material/topics/galaxy-interface/tutorials/history-to-workflow/tutorial.html) to automate and re-run the analysis or [export](https://galaxyproject.org/news/2024-05-03-inveniordm-integration/) the data you created to a repository.
