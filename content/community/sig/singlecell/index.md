We are a mix of users, developers, and trainers providing feedback and energy to improve and expand the Galaxy single cell capabilities.
 - **Developers**: Are you developing single cell tools in Galaxy, or looking for a place to develop in Galaxy? Do you need users, testers, or just want to make sure you're not wrapping the same tools as someone else!
 - **Users**: Do you use Galaxy single cell tools for scRNA-seq or beyond? Do you have feedback for us? Want to be a tester of new resources? Do you want to request new resources?
 - **Trainers**: Do you use Galaxy to train others in single cell analysis? Do you have feedback or requests on how we can support users better now and in the future?
Do you want to impact the future of single cell in Galaxy?

**Welcome to the Galaxy Single-Cell Community of Practice!**

Anyone with energy! We love hearing from users, developers, trainers, and everyone in between who is using or developing Galaxy for single cell analysis.

# How do we function?

**Meetings** We meet every 6 weeks (alternating USA and AU time zones) for 1 hour.

Our meeting agenda is:
1. Random intro chatter & introductions
2. Updates from Trello site (what people are working on / asking for help)
    - <i class="fa fa-optin-monster" aria-hidden="true"></i> Help/bugs
    - Status reports & new stuff that’s happening
3. Other cool stuff (example: Smorgasbord)
4. Ongoing actions to send out

**Emails** We send out emails to the mailing list after each meeting, at the mid-way point between meetings, and the day before meetings as a reminder.

**Notes** We keep rolling notes on a googledoc and monitor our work on Trello.

**Collaborative Chat Forums** When people ask for help or are working across institutes, we set up chat sub-channels to bring them together.

**General Chat Forum** We have a chat forum to discuss news and ideas, and are represented in the Galaxy Community Reps chat group.
