# Community Maintained, Curated and Ready-to-Use Resources

## Tools and Workflows

MGL provides **315+ tool suites** and **115+ curated workflows** for comprehensive microbial data analysis:

![This diagram illustrates comprehensive workflows for analyzing microbial isolate and microbiome samples through genomics, transcriptomics, and proteomics approaches. For microbial isolates (Panel A), the process begins with raw genomic, transcriptomic, or proteomic data, which is cleaned and processed into assemblies, mapped reads, or peptide data. These are further analyzed to identify strains, genes, and functional elements such as antimicrobial peptides, virulence factors, and biosynthetic genes. The workflow also includes comparative analyses, annotation, and visualization of results. For microbiome samples (Panel B), raw data from metabarcoding, metagenomics, metatranscriptomics, and metaproteomics are processed to generate taxonomic and functional profiles. This involves cleaning and assembling reads, identifying operational taxonomic units (OTUs) or amplicon sequence variants (ASVs), and constructing annotated gene catalogs. The workflows culminate in diversity metrics, functional tables, community profile visualizations, and differential feature analyses. The diagram highlights the interconnectedness of data types and analytical steps, emphasizing the integration of multi-omics approaches for comprehensive microbial and microbiome research.](https://github.com/usegalaxy-eu/microbiology_galaxy_lab_paper_2025/blob/main/docs/figures/figure_4.png?raw=true)
