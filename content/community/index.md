A vibrant community of contributors is the reason this project exists. The [Galaxy team](/galaxy-team/) alone cannot possibly [maintain enough servers](/use/), [wrap enough tools](https://toolshed.g2.bx.psu.edu/), [teach enough workshops](/events/), implement [all needed features](https://github.com/galaxyproject), or [answer every question](/support/) on its own. This is why community is vital to our core mission - enabling reproducible research in data-rich sciences and beyond. Members within the Galaxy community are located all around the world and often form subgroups that differ in size (small versus large) and degree of privacy (public versus private). This page highlights these groups.

# Galaxy Community Conference

<img class="float-right" style="max-width: 16rem;" src="/images/events/gcc2021/gcc2021-logo-wide-trans.png">

In 2010 the National Science Foundation initiated a yearly gathering of Galaxy users and developers by providing the project with a grant supplement. Since then this gathering has grown into an annual event known as the **[Galaxy Community Conference (GCC)](/gcc/)**. GCC alternates between North America and elsewhere, and provides a forum for sharing knowledge and building collaborations. There have been over 200 participants every year since 2012.

# Set up your own community

Galaxy is composed of plenty of subcommunities, either [regional](/community/sig/#regional-communities) or [communities of practice](/community/sig/#communities-of-practice). Check them out and if you find one suitable for you, please see [**here**](/get-started/new-leads/) on how to set up your own.


# Galaxy Mentor Network

[Galaxy Mentor Network](https://galaxy-mentor-network.netlify.app/) (GMN) program is an initiative by the Galaxy Community to build her members in open source projects.

It is a two-month mentoring program designed for Galaxy community members to come together as mentors and mentees to achieve a goal, share knowledge and expertise, ask questions, receive feedback, network, and most of all, get support from peers(mentors) without having to wait for days for a response from the community via the Help Forum or communication channels. 

# Interacting communities with Galaxy

## Conda and Bioconda

<img class="float-right" style="max-width: 15rem;" src="/images/logos/bioconda_64.png" alt="Bioconda logo" />

[Conda](https://conda.io/docs/index.html) is an open source package management system that is heavily used by Galaxy to manage tool dependencies and installations. [Bioconda](https://bioconda.github.io/) is a specific channel for Conda that distributes popular bioinformatics software, many of which have been wrapped by the Galaxy community.

## Open Life Science 

<img class="float-right" style="max-width: 15rem;" src="/images/logos/open-life-science-logo.png" alt="Open life science logo" />

[Open Life Science](https://openlifesci.org/) (OLS) is an online mentoring & training program to help individuals and stakeholders in research to become Open Science ambassadors. Participants of this program learn essential knowledge required to create, lead, and sustain an Open Science project, connect with members across different communities, backgrounds, and identities by sharing their experiences and expertise.

## Outreachy

<img class="float-right" style="max-width: 15rem;" src="/images/logos/outreachy-logo.svg" alt="Outreachy logo" />

[Outreachy](https://www.outreachy.org/) provides internships in open source and open science for people subject to systemic bias and impacted by underrepresentation in the technical industry where they are living. Outreachy internship projects may include programming, research, user experience, documentation, graphical design, data science, marketing, user advocacy, or event planning.

### Well-being and Mental Health Guideline

It is a guideline developed as part of the Outreachy program, which focused on developing a culture of well-being in the community. The guideline addresses well-being and mental health in open-source communities by focusing on common challenges faced in open-source that affect mental health and well-being. It is designed to increase awareness about well-being and mental health in the communities, as well as promote it by providing recommendations and resources to those common challenges. You can access it through this [**link**](https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.7194426) on Zenodo.

## Bioconductor

<img class="float-right" style="max-width: 15rem;" src="/images/logos/BioconductorLogo.gif" alt="Bioconductor logo" />

The mission of the [Bioconductor project](https://www.bioconductor.org/) is to develop, support, and disseminate free open source software that facilitates rigorous and reproducible analysis of data from current and emerging biological assays. Bioconductor uses the R statistical programming language, and is open source and open development. It has two releases each year, and an active user community.

## F1000Research
<img class="float-right" style="max-width: 15rem;" src="/images/logos/f1000-logo-simple.jpg" alt="F1000Research logo" />

[F1000Research](https://f1000research.com/?utm_source=shared_link&utm_medium=post&utm_campaign=JRC27054) enables scientists and scholars to publish their research rapidly, openly, and transparently via an author-centric platform. We publish research across all academic disciplines and in multiple formats, including original articles, data notes, software tool articles and method articles. 

F1000Research operates a unique post-publication open peer review process, enabling authors to engage with their reviewers transparently, whilst also making the research available to a global audience as quickly as possible.
