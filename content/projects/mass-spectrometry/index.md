We are a mix of users, developers, and trainers providing feedback and energy to improve and expand the processing of mass spectrometry data with Galaxy. Do you use Galaxy in your research? Do you have feedback for us? Want to be a tester of new resources? Want to impact the future of computational mass spectrometry in Galaxy? Are you a developer looking for a place to play? Are you developing Galaxy materials and want to stay aware of what others are doing in this field?

**Welcome to the Galaxy Mass Spectrometry Community of Practice!**

## I'm just trying to learn to analyse my data, how did I get here?
Hello user! You'll be interested in the following resources:

 - [Learning pathway for getting to grips with Galaxy and <>]()
 - [Proteomics training material](https://training.galaxyproject.org/training-material/topics/proteomics)
 - [Metabolomics training material](https://training.galaxyproject.org/training-material/topics/metabolomics)
 - Galaxy instance: [<> instance]()
 - [Matrix channel for asking for help](https://matrix.to/#/#galaxyproject_mass-spectrometry:matrix.org)

Saying that, we'd absolutely love to have users feedback on their experiences to help us improve. You'd be very welcome to join the Community of Practice to help improve the processing of mass spectrometry data in Galaxy!

# What are the goals of the Mass Spectrometry community of practice?

🎯Goals
- Prevent work duplication
- Collaborate across pipeline, ensuring users feedback to developers
- Identify community needs
- Tool & tutorial development
- Testing
- Build & support user community
- <Modify/adapt the above>

# Who are we looking for?

Anyone with energy! We love hearing from users, developers, trainers, and everyone in between who is using or developing Galaxy for mass spectrometry analysis.

# How do we function?

<Change/adapt/edit this section>

We meet every <3 weeks (alternating USA and AU time zones) for 1 hour>.

Our meeting agenda is:
 - Random intro chatter & introductions
 - Updates from Trello site (what people are working on / asking for help)
    - 🐛Help/bugs
    - Status reports & new stuff that’s happening
 - Other cool stuff (example: Smorgasbord)
 - Ongoing actions to send out

We send out emails to the mailing list after each meeting, at the mid-way point between meetings, and the day before meetings as a reminder.

We keep rolling notes on a googledoc and monitor our work on Trello.

When people ask for help or are working across institutes, we set up chat sub-channels to bring them together.

We have a chat forum to discuss news and ideas, and are represented in the Galaxy Community Reps chat group.
