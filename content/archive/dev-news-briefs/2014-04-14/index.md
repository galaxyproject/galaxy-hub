# Upgrades

* **Review instructions for core build: [Getting the Stable Distribution](http://getgalaxy.org)**
* **Review reset for Tool Shed repos: [Resetting Metadata For Installed Repositories](http://wiki.galaxyproject.org/ResettingMetadataForInstalledRepositories)**

<br />
# Data

1. New and updated reference genomes added to [Rsync](https://wiki.galaxyproject.org/Admin/UseGalaxyRsync) server that mirrors contents of the public Main [http://usegalaxy.org](http://usegalaxy.org) instance

* New/updated genomes: 115
    * includes hg38
    * note: all available in tool "Extract Genomic DNA"
* New bowtie indexes: 60
* New bowtie2 indexes: 115
* New BWA indexes: 54
* New lastz indexes: 54
* New sam indexes: 64
* New picard (srma) indexes: 59
* New liftOver mappings: 163

1. MAF hg19 100waymultiz conservation alignment sourced from [UCSC](http://genome.ucsc.edu)
1. Replaced: The sam index for hg_g1k_b37 was updated to use "samtools faidx" with version 0.1.18 (original from GATK 1.4 bundle used 0.1.13). The older index lead to some issues with BAM<->SAM conversion using the newer SAMTools version.

<br />
# Visualizations

1. Framework turning https://trello.com/c/kdhJ1Dit
1. *Trackster*:

* View complete read/feature across tile boundaries, in all tiles https://trello.com/c[/Q03dC1](/archive/dev-news-briefs/2014-04-14/Q03dC1/)QC
* Better handling of deep coverage regions in read tracks https://trello.com/c/TxxzqWNx
