# Centralized redirect definitions for the Galaxy Community Hub
#
# These redirects are consumed at build time to generate 301 permanent
# redirects. They're kept here in the content directory so they stay
# framework-agnostic and human-editable.
#
# Two types of redirects are supported:
#
#   1. Simple redirects: exact path-to-path mappings
#   2. Pattern redirects: dynamic path patterns with placeholders
#
# Content-level redirects (individual pages with `redirect:` in their
# frontmatter) are handled separately and don't need to be listed here.

# Pattern redirects — dynamic path mappings with [...slug] placeholders.
# These are applied as route-level patterns, not individual redirect pages.
patterns:
  /blog/[...slug]: /news/[...slug]

# Simple redirects — exact path mappings (from → to).
