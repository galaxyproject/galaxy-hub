    bio: |
      [BIONT](https://biont-training.eu/index.html) – BIO Network for Training – is an international consortium of academic entities and SMEs with the aim to provide a high-quality training program and community for digital skills relevant to the biotechnology industry and biomedical sector.

      Project is running from 2023-2026.

      The basic curriculum of the program aims at employees or job seekers with limited prior experience in handling, processing and visualizing biological data and/or the usage of computational biology tools.

      The advanced curriculum is targeted at Data Stewards, System Administrators, and other professionals who hold leading roles in the management and deployment of computational resources at their workplaces. It is building upon the strong expertise in digital literacy training of its members as well as on its wide network of collaborations and other initiatives aimed at professionalizing Life Sciences data management, processing and analysis skills.

      Standardization and state- of-the-art technological implementation will reinforce the training and outreach activities plan.

      The program builds on short dedicated remote workshops as well as training recordings and will generate specific training material as Open Educational Resources which will be made available in a dedicated web platform.

      The consortium structure and high connectivity to relevant networks will foster project sustainability and efficient knowledge delivery to the stakeholders throughout the entire duration of the project and beyond, all this under a well defined and transparent management system.

      University of Freiburg is participating in BioNT through the BioInformatics group Freiburg and its Freiburg Galaxy Team.

      We are responsible for delivering training in BioNT, like "A practical introduction to bioinformatics and RNA-seq using Galaxy" and "From Zero to Hero with Python".
      Moreover, we provide consultancy on the Galaxy Training network and the Galaxy Team helps shape the report concerning language-specific communities, the selection of workshops' participants, coordination with the Carpentries and project ambassador recruitment and communication.
