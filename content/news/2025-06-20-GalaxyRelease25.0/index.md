# The Galaxy 25.0 Release is Live\!

We’re thrilled to announce the release of Galaxy 25.0, now live across public Galaxy servers\!

# Key Highlights in Galaxy 25.0

## Dataset Collection Enhancements

Collections are now more flexible than ever:

* Improved support for creating and managing nested collections  
* Enhanced rule-based creation of lists and pairs  
* New display options and context menu actions

## Performance and Backend Tweaks

A range of backend performance improvements means faster load times and smoother interactions across the board. The system is more robust when handling large datasets and extensive histories.

# What This Means for You
