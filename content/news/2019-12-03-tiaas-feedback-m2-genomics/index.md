At the end of November, we organized a 2-day workshop (reads quality, short and long reads genome assembly, reads mapping and RNAseq differential gene expression) for 12 master students.

The server reserved for our training went very well, waiting time for requests were absolutely reasonable for our datasets (3 Mb bacterial genome).

Usegalaxy.eu provides a huge list of useful tools for genomic and statistic analysis, sharing histories was super useful for the students and the status session was super convenient for me to follow their requests.
