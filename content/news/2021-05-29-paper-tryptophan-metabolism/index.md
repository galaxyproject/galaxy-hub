Mirco Friedrich, Roman Sankowski, Lukas Bunse and colleagues from the University of Freiburg and the German Cancer Research Center (DKFZ), have published a new manuscript about the influence of Tryptophan metabolism on IDH-mutant gliomas. Congratulations and thanks for using Galaxy!

_Abstract_ 

The dynamics and phenotypes of intratumoral myeloid cells during tumor progression are poorly understood. Here we define myeloid cellular states in gliomas by longitudinal single-cell profiling and demonstrate their strict control by the tumor genotype: in isocitrate dehydrogenase (IDH)-mutant tumors, differentiation of infiltrating myeloid cells is blocked, resulting in an immature phenotype. In late-stage gliomas, monocyte-derived macrophages drive tolerogenic alignment of the microenvironment, thus preventing T cell response. We define the IDH-dependent tumor education of infiltrating macrophages to be causally related to a complex re-orchestration of tryptophan metabolism, resulting in activation of the aryl hydrocarbon receptor. We further show that the altered metabolism of IDH-mutant gliomas maintains this axis in bystander cells and that pharmacological inhibition of tryptophan metabolism can reverse immunosuppression. In conclusion, we provide evidence of a glioma genotype-dependent intratumoral network of resident and recruited myeloid cells and identify tryptophan metabolism as a target for immunotherapy of IDH-mutant tumors.
