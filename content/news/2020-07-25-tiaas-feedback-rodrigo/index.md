An introductory workshop to bacterial whole-genome sequence analysis was delivered from December 9-12, 2019 in the [Lethbridge Research and Development Centre](https://www.agr.gc.ca)
(Agriculture and Agri-Food Canada). There were 7 participants which included a research scientist (PI), a visiting scientist, a research technician, a postdoctoral fellow, and three graduate students. 

Besides materials from the Galaxy Training Network, publicly available materials from the Canadian Bioinformatics Workshops (Bioinformatics.ca), as well as from Torsten Seeman’s presentations were used for the workshop. The instructor (Rodrigo Ortega Polo) guided attendees through theoretical concepts from the GTN, Bioinformatics.ca and Dr. Seeman’s materials,
and hands-on exercises using TIaaS. Trainees learned about working with NGS data, sequence quality assessment, *de novo* assembly,
genome annotation and pan-genome analysis. The participants were very enthusiastic and asked great questions about both Galaxy and the subject matter.
