**<h2>Contributions to major genomic initiatives: VGP and ERGA-BGE</h2>**

Galaxy has played a role in contributing significantly to large-scale biodiversity genomics projects, notably the [Vertebrate Genomes Project (VGP)](https://vertebrategenomesproject.org/) and the [European Reference Genome Atlas (ERGA)](https://www.erga-biodiversity.eu/) within the [Biodiversity Genomics Europe (BGE)](https://biodiversitygenomics.eu/) framework. The VGP leverages Galaxy to produce reference-quality genomes for 74,963 vertebrate species. Its standardized workflows ensure consistency and transparency, with all data and methods openly accessible via public repositories. To cater the demand for generating and curating a large number of genome assemblies, the Galaxy project has created [VGP-Galaxy](https://vgp.usegalaxy.org/), a dedicated Galaxy instance equipped with tailored tools and robust computational resources. As of January 2025, the Vertebrate Genomes Project (VGP) has successfully produced 315 genome assemblies representing 188 species through the VGP-Galaxy platform. All generated genome assemblies have been submitted to [Genome Ark](https://www.genomeark.org/) and are publicly accessible. 

Similarly, ERGA, under the BGE initiative, utilizes Galaxy to support the ambitious goal of sequencing approximately 200,000 European eukaryotic species. Aligned with the [Earth BioGenome Project (EBP)](https://www.earthbiogenome.org/) standards, Galaxy’s infrastructure enables the generation of high-quality reference genomes, facilitating biodiversity monitoring and conservation efforts. Additionally, ERGA-BGE researchers have developed specialized workflows using Galaxy, such as the ONT+Illumina & HiC pipeline (NextDenovo-HyPo + Purge_Dups + YaHS), which are deposited in [WorkflowHub](https://workflowhub.eu/workflows?filter%5Btag%5D=ERGA&filter%5Bworkflow_type%5D=galaxy). These workflows combine Oxford Nanopore long reads, Illumina short reads, and Hi-C data to produce robust assemblies, enhancing the toolkit available to the global research community. These workflows are deposited in WorkflowHub and are planned to be submitted to [IWC Galaxy](https://iwc.galaxyproject.org/) (Intergalactic Workflow Commission Galaxy) for long-term maintenance, updates, and support, ensuring their availability and adaptability for future research.

**<h2>Development of ERGA EAR and ERGA Bot for the BGE Project</h2>**

Within the ERGA-BGE collaboration, Galaxy along with its project partners from IZW, have facilitated the development of ERGA EAR and ERGA Bot. The [ERGA Assembly Report (EAR)](https://galaxyproject.org/news/2024-09-19-erga-ear/) is a standardized, community-developed document implemented in Galaxy to evaluate genome assemblies. It incorporates metrics such as contiguity (e.g., N50), gene content completeness via BUSCO analysis, and contamination screening, providing a comprehensive assessment aligned with EBP quality thresholds. This tool enhances transparency and ensures that assemblies meet rigorous scientific standards.

Complementing EAR, the [ERGA Bot](https://galaxyproject.org/news/2026-03-07-erga-bot/) is an automated validation system built using GitHub actions for the BGE project. Designed to streamline quality assurance, it processes assembly reports, identifies anomalies, and enforces consistency across the diverse datasets generated by ERGA’s distributed network. Together, EAR and ERGA Bot represent significant advancements in automating and standardizing genome assembly evaluation, critical for large-scale genomic initiatives.
