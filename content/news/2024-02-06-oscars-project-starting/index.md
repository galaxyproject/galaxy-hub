The [Albert-Ludwigs-University Freiburg](https://uni-freiburg.de) and the [Galaxy Team](https://usegalaxy-eu.github.io/people) are happy to announce the participation in the ["**O**pen **S**cience **C**lusters' **A**ction for **R**esearch & **S**ociety" (OSCARS)](https://oscars-project.eu/). With [EuroScienceGateway (ESG)](https://www.eurosciencegateway.org) running in its second year now, OSCARS is an additional project from the [EOSC](https://digital-strategy.ec.europa.eu/en/policies/open-science-cloud) space to be involved in. Similar to ESG, this project offers the opportunity to foster connection to a variety communities beyond life sciences, underlining Galaxy being principally domain-agnostic. OSCARS is financed by the European Commission though the European Research Executive Agency‘s HORIZON-INFRA-2023-EOSC-01-01 funding line, under grant agreement number 101129751.

The project's central mission is to bring together world-class European Research Infrastructures (RIs) in the [ESFRI](https://www.esfri.eu) roadmap and beyond to foster the uptake of Open Science in Europe.

Over the next four years, 15 such RIs are partners in OSCARS, representing the five [Science Clusters](https://science-clusters.eu) (Humanities and Social Sciences, Life Sciences, Environmental Sciences, Photon and Neutron Science, Astronomy, Nuclear and Particle Physics). Their common aim is to make open data easily accessible to users and the public, by providing FAIR data management policies and practices for enabling [Open Science](https://research-and-innovation.ec.europa.eu/strategy/strategy-2020-2024/our-digital-future/open-science_en). OSCARS will 
 * Consolidate achievements from the five H2020 [INFRA-EOSC-2018-01-04 projects](https://ec.europa.eu/info/funding-tenders/opportunities/portal/screen/opportunities/topic-details/infraeosc-04-2018) into lasting interdisciplinary services and working practices, and
 * Lead and foster the involvement of a broad range of research communities in EOSC via the development of new Open Science projects to drive the uptake of FAIR-data-intensive research.

While having officially started on 1st January 2024, we are looking forward to the kick-off meeting from 13th to 15th March 2024; not least we are happy to join forces with well-known as well as new partners from all over Europe.

As for [EuroScienceGateway](https://galaxyproject.org/projects/esg/news/), we will keep you informed about developments via [blog posts](https://galaxyproject.org/eu/news/) and social media ([Mastodon](https://mstdn.science/@galaxyproject), [Linkedin](https://www.linkedin.com/groups/4907635/)), but also recommend to follow OSCARS itself on [X](https://twitter.com/oscars_eu) and [Linkedin](https://www.linkedin.com/company/oscars-project/).
