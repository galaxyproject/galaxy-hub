Thanks to a collaborative effort between the teams at Galaxy Training Network (GTN), WorkflowHub, and Australian BioCommons, GTN workflows are now registered automatically with WorkflowHub. The existing set of workflows can be viewed here: GTN on WorkflowHub. For every new tutorial that is added to the GTN, any workflows that it contains will now also be pushed to WorkflowHub.
