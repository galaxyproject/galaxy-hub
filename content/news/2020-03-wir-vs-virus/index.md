We want to encourage you to participate and join the fight against COVID-19.

The Federal Government of Germany is organising the [#WirVsVirus Hackathon](https://wirvsvirushackathon.org/), and we at Galaxy are here to help.

The Galaxy community freely offers [RStudio](https://galaxyproject.github.io/training-material/topics/galaxy-ui/tutorials/rstudio/tutorial.html) and [Jupyter notebook](https://galaxyproject.github.io/training-material/topics/galaxy-ui/tutorials/galaxy-intro-jupyter/tutorial.html) instances, hosted using the de.NBI-cloud infrastructure aided by more than 3000 cores and extensive memory resources.

All tools and notebook instances are backed by a foundation of scientific and computational reproducibility, using the power of [Bioconda](https://bioconda.github.io/), along with the full [Galaxy suite](https://usegalaxy.eu) of 2000+ bioinformatic tools to experiment with at your disposal.

Take a look at [https://covid19.galaxyproject.org/](https://covid19.galaxyproject.org/) for an initial analysis of COVID-19 data using Galaxy, BioConda and public research infrastructure (XSEDE, de.NBI-cloud, ARDC cloud).

Feel free to contact us at <galaxy@informatik.uni-freiburg.de> for further information or if we can support your research with our infrastructure.

Stay healthy!
