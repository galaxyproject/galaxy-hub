## Abstract

>RNA  plays  essential  regulatory  roles  in  all  known  forms  of life. Clustering RNA sequences with common sequence and structure is an essential step towards studying RNA function. With  the  advent  of  high-throughput  sequencing  techniques, experimental and genomic data are expanding to complement the predictive methods. However, the existing methods do not effectively utilize and cope with the immense amount of data becoming available. Here we present GraphClust2, a comprehensive approach for scalable clustering of RNAs based on sequence and structural similarities. GraphClust2 provides an integrative solution by incorporating  diverse  types  of  experimental  and  genomic data in an accessible fashion via the Galaxy framework. We demonstrate  that  the  tasks  of  clustering  and  annotation  of structured  RNAs  can  be  considerably  improved,  through  a scalable  methodology  that  also  supports  structure  probing data.  Based  on  this,  we  further  introduce  an  off-the-shelf procedure  to  identify  locally  conserved  structure  candidates in long RNAs. In this way, we suggest the presence and the sparsity of phylogenetically conserved local structures in some long  non-coding  RNAs.  Furthermore,  we  demonstrate  the advantage of a scalable clustering for discovering structured motifs  under  inherent  and  experimental  biases  and  uncover prominent targets of the double-stranded RNA binding protein Roquin-1 that are evolutionary conserved.
