We had a very nice Galaxy Admin workshop in Oslo.

Over 30 participants from all over Europe learned how to setup a highly scalable Galaxy server and how to use
resource efficiently. We would like to thank the traininers Nicola Soranzo (GB), Marius van den Beek (FR), Enis Afghan (USA), Abdulrahman Azab (NO) and Björn Grüning (DE), as well
as our sponsors ELIXIR, de.NBI and the awesome host - the University of Oslo.
