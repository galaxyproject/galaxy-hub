During January 2021, I led two Galaxy workshops; the first was for 20 Graduate students and lasted for five days from 9 am-2 pm. The students learned how to use the Galaxy platform to perform basic text processing and RNA-seq analysis. Their final project was to use Galaxy to analyze RNA-seq data related to their research.

The second workshop was given to 20 medical doctors. In five meetings of 4 hours each, they were introduced to the Galaxy platform and analyzed both exome trio data and RNA-seq.
The feedback I received from both events was fantastic. Students were thrilled with the ability to perform analyses without needing to write code. They found Galaxy to be user-friendly and easy to operate, and I am sure they will use it in their research.

I would like to thank Galaxy eu. team, for providing the excellent TIaaS service, and to thank the team and especially to Beatriz Serrano-Solano, for their generous support!!!
