Last week, the [ELIXIR Galaxy Community](https://elixir-europe.org/communities/galaxy) organized a [4-days workshop related to Galaxy tool integration and training]({% link _events/2019-01-28-roscoff-workshop.md %}). This event was hosted by the [Biological station of Roscoff](http://www.sb-roscoff.fr/), in the (sunny/rainy) beautiful Brittany (France).

15 participants joined the workshop from 4 european countries, with heterogeneous background.

The first day was dedicated to training: how to integrate tools to Galaxy and how to create training material for Galaxy, with Gildas, Anthony, Björn, Bérénice and Lorraine as instructors.

Subsequently, a Hackathon started with several self-organised groups:
- Tool integration
- Training Material
- Continuous Integration (Travis / Circle CI / Gitlab CI)
- Galaxy Interactive Environment
- Galaxy Genome Annotation
- Material and Methods automatic generation

We also had some breakout sessions about:
- Galaxy Administration: usegalaxy.* by usegalaxy.eu
- Galaxy Interactive Tour
- Visualization within Galaxy

Based on the nice feedback we received, the 15 participants and the 4 instuctors enjoyed this workshop, but also the local food and the warm welcome of the organizers. Thanks again for this fabulous workshop!
