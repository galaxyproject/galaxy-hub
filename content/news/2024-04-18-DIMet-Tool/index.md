Please welcome [Tracegroomer](https://toolshed.g2.bx.psu.edu/repository?repository_id=25b635ecf4f7c8dc - new member of the European Galaxy bookshelf.

TraceGroomer is a solution for formatting and normalising isotope-labeled (a.k.a tracer) metabolomics given file(s), to produce the tabular files ready for the [DIMet](https://usegalaxy.eu/root?tool_id=toolshed.g2.bx.psu.edu/repos/iuc/dimet_differential_analysis/dimet_differential_analysis/0.2.4+galaxy1) tool.
Several input formats, such as IsoCor output files, are accepted, and more! For any of the supported inputs, TraceGroomer generates an independent file for each type of quantification:

i) total metabolite abundances
ii) Isotopologues
iii) Isotopologues' proportions and
iv) mean enrichment (a.k.a fractional contributions)

Moreover, data normalization -whether by the amount of material and/or by an internal standard- is also possible: TraceGroomer processes your data in seconds!
