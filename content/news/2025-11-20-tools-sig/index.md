The Galaxy Project is pleased to announce the formation of the [Tool Developers Special Interest Group (SIG)](https://galaxyproject.org/community/sig/tool-developers/), a new initiative designed to strengthen the backbone of the Galaxy ecosystem: its tools.

Operating as an extension of the [Intergalactic Utilities Commission (IUC)](https://galaxyproject.org/iuc/), this group provides a dedicated forum for developers of all experience levels to collaborate on high-quality, sustainable tool development. The [SIG](https://galaxyproject.org/community/sig/) was established to address the growing need for coordinated maintenance, standardized best practices, and a supportive environment for knowledge sharing within the community.

# A Hub for Innovation and Mentorship

The Tool Developers SIG aims to standardize and streamline the creation of Galaxy tool wrappers. By centralizing efforts, the group ensures that tools remain accessible, functional, and scientifically rigorous.

Key objectives include:

- **Standardization:** Establishing and maintaining best practices for wrapping, testing, and documentation.
- **Collaboration:** Coordinating [community-driven](https://galaxyproject.org/community/) maintenance responsibilities to reduce redundancy.
- **Mentorship:** Offering training sessions and peer support to onboard new developers and elevate the skills of existing contributors ([similar to this event](https://galaxyproject.org/news/2025-07-10-tool-dev-workshop/)).
- **Governance:** Representing the technical needs of tool developers within the broader Galaxy governance structure.

# Call for Participation

Membership is open to **all** individuals interested in improving the Galaxy tool ecosystem, **regardless of their current skill level**. Whether you are an experienced [IUC](https://galaxyproject.org/iuc/) member or a newcomer seeking to learn tool wrapping, your contributions are vital.

The group engages through bimonthly virtual meetings, peer review cycles, and collaborative hackathons.

# How to Join

We invite all interested developers to participate in our upcoming sessions.

- **Meetings:** Held every 2nd and 4th Thursday of the month at 14:00 CET.
- **Communication:** Join the discussion on our [Matrix channel](https://matrix.to/#/#galaxy-iuc_iuc:gitter.im) or follow our progress on the GitHub Project Board.
