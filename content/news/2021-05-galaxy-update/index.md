<div class="card-header">Share your favorite James Taylor story: Deadline extended to May 7</div>

It's been a year since [James Taylor](/jxtx/) passed away.  To remember him, and mark his upcoming birthday (May 18) we are creating a community video, *and we have extended the deadline for contributions to this Friday, May 7*.  We are asking you to tell us your favorite story about James in ~ 30 seconds. We will combine your clips into a video that will be prominently featured on all Galaxy-related sites.

Here is what we will need you to do by the end of Friday, May 7:

1. Think of your favorite story/interaction/event involving James
2. Pick a nice location and record the video!
3. The video should be:

* in a high-resolution
* without background noise
* in a horizontal orientation (not vertical!)
* ≲ 30 seconds in length

4. Deposit video file to your Google Drive or Dropbox folder (or any other location that would allow us to retrieve it)
5. Send a link to the video, your name and location as you would like them to appear in the final video to: outreach@galaxyproject.org

Thank you all in advance and please feel free to invite other friends of James to participate.

[GCC2021 Registration](https://www.vibconferences.be/events/gcc2021)

</div>

**The [2021 Galaxy Community Conference](https://www.vibconferences.be/events/gcc2021) will be held 28 June through July 10.  It will be [virtual, affordable, and globally accessible](/news/2021-02-gcc-virtual/).**

GCC2021 will start with a [__week of online training__](https://galaxyproject.org/events/gcc2021/training/). Training will largely use the GTN Smörgåsbord model: lectures will be prerecorded, with live help available on chat for the duration of the week. This model allows participants to learn at their own pace, avoids scheduling conflicts that are inherent with our usual multi-track training, and enables those with low bandwidth internet connections to fully participate.


__Registration closes June 25__

Registering before __June 1__ saves 50% off of the full rates. Registration discounts will be available to researchers from low and lower-middle income countries. For everyone else, registration are downright cheap too: the rates start in €15.00 for the training week and in €25.00 for the 3-day conference (plus VAT). The CoFest is free.

**And [GCC2021 is looking for sponsors](http://bit.ly/gcc2021_prospectus_v1) too!**

</div>

Several deadlines for the [2021 Galaxy Community Conference (GCC2021)](https://www.vibconferences.be/events/gcc2021-virtual-edition) have been extended. See below.

GCC2021 talk and poster/demo presentations will be selected from abstract submissions. We welcome submissions that use, implement or extend the Galaxy platform and ecosystem, including integrating and analyzing datasets in any research area, enhancing reproducibility in computational analyses, and fostering collaboration in scientific workflow development

**Talk Abstracts: 17 May**

Talks can be either long (15-20 minutes) or lightning (5-7 minutes). **Talks** will be pre-recorded, with live Q`&`A. [Submit your abstract now](https://www.vibconferences.be/events/gcc2021-virtual-edition#abstracts).

**Poster/Demo Abstracts: 14 June**

(However, you are encouraged to submit your abstracts earlier, if at all possible.)  Poster/Demos will be presented live at Remo.co tables and will not be limited to a single large PDF.  They are an opportunity to fully communicate your work. [Submit your abstract now](https://www.vibconferences.be/events/gcc2021-virtual-edition#abstracts).

**GCC2021 Community Fellowships: 17 May**

The Galaxy Community Fund is offering fellowships to students, post-docs, and other non-profit / academic / government researchers based in [lower, lower-middle and upper-middle income countries](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1aFR1b8Al0DE0Ovn1pFJYlLchVUl2At82Dt4MRudvtRY/edit?usp=sharing) who will benefit from attending GCC2021, and for whom the [cost of registration](/news/2021-04-gcc-reg/) is a barrier.

Fellowships will cover the full registration for any GCC2021 events awardees want to attend. Interested?  [Apply here](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSfyqKg87x8wL1EhOfrGR0SlQui8wEkQgg3qVFi6txO6GmHgKg/viewform) by May 17.

[ISMB/ECCB/BOSC Deadlines](https://www.iscb.org/ismbeccb2021)

</div>

**Submissions due May 6**

[ISMB/ECCB 2021](https://www.iscb.org/ismbeccb2021) is one of the largest bioinformatics conferences and every year Galaxy has had a significant presence.  ISMB/ECCB is built from community building blocks, and this year that includes the **[Bioinformatics Open Source Conference (BOSC)](https://www.open-bio.org/events/bosc-2021/)** (our 2018 and 2020 conference partner), as well as communities focused on [high-throughput sequencing](http://hitseq.org/), [mass spec](http://cosi.iscb.org/wiki/CompMS:Home), [bioinformatics education](http://cosi.iscb.org/wiki/Education:Home), [visualization](http://biovis.net/2021/index.html), [microbiomes](https://www.microbiome-cosi.org/), [bioinformatics core facilities](http://bioinfo-core.org/index.php/ISMB_2021:_BioinfoCoreWorkshop), and [many others](https://www.iscb.org/communities-of-special-interest).

**[BOSC](https://www.open-bio.org/2021/03/24/join-us-at-bosc-2021/)** is a particularly good match for the Galaxy community. Topics include software development practices that promote open science standards and sharing of biological data and code, as well as approaches for building diverse communities.

Most of these are accepting talk and poster submissions through the [ISMB/ECCB website](https://www.iscb.org/ismbeccb2021), but [BioInfo-Core is taking talk submissions here](https://forms.gle/N1mfB3dEEd4oi4wBA).  All submissions are due May 6.

[QIIME 2 2021.4](https://forum.qiime2.org/t/qiime-2-2021-4-is-now-available/19340)

</div>

The 2021.4 release of QIIME2 includes a new interface, [q2galaxy](https://github.com/qiime2/q2galaxy) (see Platform News above), for generating Galaxy tool descriptions automatically from QIIME 2 actions. This means that as plugins are created and evolve, the QIIME 2 team can automatically generate complete Galaxy tools in a few seconds, rather than developing them by hand as is typically done.

[Pulsar 0.14.5](https://github.com/galaxyproject/pulsar/blob/master/HISTORY.rst)

</div>

[Pulsar](https://pypi.python.org/pypi/pulsar-app/) is a Python server application that allows a Galaxy server to run jobs on remote systems (including Windows) without requiring a shared mounted file systems. Unlike traditional Galaxy job runners - input files, scripts, and config files may be transferred to the remote system, the job is executed, and the results are transferred back to the Galaxy server - eliminating the need for a shared file system.
