This year, we were offering a training called "Analyze your NGS data in few clicks" to life science PhD students at the University of Geneva.

Once again, we could rely on the excellent support from the Freiburg Galaxy team and in particular on their free TIaaS offer. It all went smoothly. - Thank You!

Following the [Reference-based RNA-seq tutorial](https://training.galaxyproject.org/training-material/topics/transcriptomics/tutorials/ref-based/tutorial.html), we introduced many (new) features of the Galaxy ecosystem to highly motivated people. 

Lucille and Hans-Rudolf (who are looking forward to repeat this workshop next year)
