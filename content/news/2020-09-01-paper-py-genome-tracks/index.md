We are happy to announce the publication of **pyGenomeTracks (PGT)** in Bioinformatics. The tool plots combinations of genomic tracks in a
modular way and it's [available on the European Galaxy server](https://usegalaxy.eu/root?tool_id=pygenomeTracks).
Many thanks to all the authors for the great effort!

_Abstract_ 

**Motivation**: Generating publication ready plots to display multiple genomic tracks can pose a serious challenge. Making desirable and accurate
figures requires considerable effort. This is usually done by hand or by using a vector graphic software.

**Results**: pyGenomeTracks (PGT) is a modular plotting tool that easily combines multiple tracks. It enables a reproducible and standardized
generation of highly customizable and publication ready images.

**Availability**: PGT is available through a graphical interface on [https://usegalaxy.eu](https://usegalaxy.eu/root?tool_id=pygenomeTracks) and through the command line. It is provided on conda
via the bioconda channel, on pypi and it is openly developed on [GitHub](https://github.com/deeptools/pyGenomeTracks).
