![A phylogenetic tree showing the evolutionary relationships among 271 vertebrate species whose genomes were assembled by the Vertebrate Genomes Project](https://news.iu.edu/live/image/gid/13/width/1500/height/1500/crop/1/26608_Simplified_Figure_tree.rev.1768237318.webp)

The [Vertebrate Genomes Project](https://vertebrategenomesproject.org/) (VGP), powered by Galaxy running on the IU-led [Jetstream2](https://jetstream-cloud.org/) cloud computing resource, has produced **272 near error-free genome assemblies** spanning **271 vertebrate species** and **518 haplotypes**. 

## Galaxy and Jetstream2: A Powerful Partnership

Producing genome assemblies at this scale and quality requires enormous computational resources. Galaxy, running on Indiana University's Jetstream2 cloud, provided the infrastructure to make it happen. Jetstream2's **large-memory nodes** (up to 1 TB of RAM) were critical for the memory-intensive steps of genome assembly, while its scalable cloud architecture allowed the VGP to process hundreds of genomes efficiently.

Galaxy's accessible, web-based interface meant that researchers worldwide, including those without deep computational expertise, could participate in the assembly and analysis process. This combination of scalable cloud computing and an open, user-friendly platform was key to the project's success.

> "These assemblies open the door to understanding the biology of species that have never had a reference genome. For non-model organisms, this changes everything."
