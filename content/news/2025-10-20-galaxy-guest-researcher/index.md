I am a PhD candidate in **Biochemistry** at the **University of Isfahan**, with a research focus on the application of **functional nucleic acids** in medicine — both for diagnostics and for theranostics.
In **September 2024**, I had the privilege of joining the **Galaxy Europe** team in Freiburg as a visiting scientist under the leadership of **Dr. Björn Grüning**.

This experience was a turning point in my scientific journey. The Galaxy team welcomed me warmly, provided professional and technical support, and created an environment where collaboration and creativity flourished. It was also a joy and an honor to celebrate the New Year together — a moment that symbolized the spirit of community that Galaxy embodies.

## Developing New Tools: CleaveRNA

During my stay, I worked on developing **CleaveRNA**, a tool designed to support researchers in **DNAzyme design** for improved target site selection. This work aims to contribute to the **next generation of gene therapy** applications, where careful design and reproducibility are critical for success.

I would like to express my deepest gratitude to **Dr. Björn Grüning** and **Dr. Martin Raden**, whose guidance and support were invaluable throughout the development of this tool. I am also sincerely thankful to every member of the **Galaxy Europe team** for their technical help, feedback, and enthusiasm that made this work possible.

In addition to CleaveRNA, I wrapped several other tools for deployment on the Galaxy platform, expanding its capabilities for both researchers and educators.

## Training and Community Contributions

I actively participated in **Galaxy workshops**, the **Galaxy Training Network (GTN)**, and the **Imaging Hackathon**, where I experienced first-hand the openness and collaborative energy of this community.
I contributed to the training ecosystem by:

- Reviewing Galaxy tutorials
- Writing new workflows and training materials
- Developing a hands-on tutorial for **electrophoresis gel image analysis** in biochemistry applications

The electrophoresis tutorial, written in collaboration with **Diana Chiang Jurado**, reflects my passion for bridging molecular biology with accessible, reproducible computational tools. By combining **QuPath** and **Galaxy imaging tools**, the workflow provides an open alternative for gel quantification — a method that is widely used but often lacks transparency in analysis.

## Gratitude, Memories, and Reflections

Looking back, I am deeply grateful for the chance to learn from, collaborate with, and contribute to this inspiring team. **Galaxy Europe** exemplifies what can happen when open-source software, scientific rigor, and human kindness intersect.

On my final day in Freiburg, we gathered for an enjoyable **barbecue with the Galaxy team** — a warm and memorable way to conclude my stay. The team surprised me with a beautiful **wooden boat**, a symbolic gift representing the city of Freiburg, signed by Galaxy members as a keepsake of friendship and collaboration. It is a memory I will always cherish.

> *“Science is not only about answering questions, but also about building the bridges that allow others to cross into new territories of knowledge.”*

I would like to thank the **Galaxy Europe team** — especially **Dr. Björn Grüning**, **Prof. Rolf Backofen**, **Dr. Martin Raden**, **Dr. Anup Kumar**, **Dr. Pavan Videm** and all my wonderful colleagues — for their support, encouragement, and vision. It was my honor to work alongside you, to share knowledge, and to contribute in my own way to the Galaxy ecosystem. I would also like to warmly acknowledge the invaluable support of my supervisors at the University of Isfahan, **Dr. Fatemeh Javadi-Zarnaghi** and **Dr. Fariba Dehghanian**, whose scientific guidance and continuous encouragement, greatly enriched my research stay and overall academic growth.

I returned to my PhD journey at the **University of Isfahan** with renewed energy, inspiration, and a deep appreciation for the Galaxy community. I look forward to continuing our collaboration and to helping build tools and training that empower researchers worldwide.
