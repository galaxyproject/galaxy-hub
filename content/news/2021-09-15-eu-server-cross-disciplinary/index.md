Galaxy is nowadays well-known to be a __cross-discipline platform that connects researchers all over the world__. Many different communities use it and several projects at different levels are supporting the [European Galaxy server](https://usegalaxy.eu/). 


At the __German level__, [de.NBI](https://www.denbi.de) provides the cloud infrastructure and the newly established [NFDI](https://www.nfdi.de/) (Nationale Forschungsdateninfrastruktur) covers the data aspects. Within the [DFG](https://www.dfg.de/) (Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft) funded project [DataPLANT](https://www.nfdi4plants.de/), scientists will be able to use a well-annotated data management platform for plant research, a key aspect for future reproducibility and reusability of the resources. 

On the clinical side, [MIRACUM](https://www.miracum.org) (Medical Informatics in Research and Medicine) supports molecular tumor boards from several university hospitals across Germany. A recent [article](https://www.denbi.de/news/1279-for-better-patient-care-cooperation-between-miracum-and-the-german-network-for-bioinformatics-infrastructure-de-nbi) bridges both the cloud infrastructure and the clinical research carried out by MIRACUM. 

[BioDATEN](https://portal.biodaten.info) (Bioinformatics DATa ENvironment), funded by the Ministry of Science, Research and the Arts of the State of Baden-WÃ¼rttemberg, aims at building a Science Data Center to handle increasing amounts of data.

On the __European level__, the cross-disciplinary nature reaches the European Open Science Cloud (EOSC) landscape, being the European Galaxy server listed as a service in the [EOSC marketplace](https://marketplace.eosc-portal.eu/services/european-galaxy-server).

In [EOSC-Life](https://www.eosc-life.eu/), the European Galaxy server provides cloud infrastructure and support on the software stack required to implement workflows for the Biomedical Sciences. In the two open calls for training, EOSC-Life has granted a [workshop on Functionally Assembled Terrestrial Ecosystem Simulator ](https://www.eosc-life.eu/news/training-online-galaxy-training-on-functionally-assembled-terrestrial-ecosystem-simulator-fates/) and [Training Infrastructure as a Service (TIaaS)](https://galaxyproject.eu/posts/2021/08/24/tiaas-flyer/). Several EOSC-Life communities ([chemoinformatics](https://www.eosc-life.eu/d1/), [marine genomics](https://www.eosc-life.eu/d4/) and [imaging](https://www.eosc-life.eu/d6/)) have described their use cases with Galaxy workflows. Other EOSC projects have also prominent use cases with Galaxy, like [EOSC-Pillar](https://www.eosc-pillar.eu/), with [reference data](https://www.eosc-pillar.eu/use-cases/exploring-reference-data-through-existing-computing-services-bioinformatics-community) and [EOSC-Nordic](https://www.eosc-nordic.eu/) with the [Climate Science Workbench](https://nordicesmhub.github.io/EOSC/). 

Thank you to all the different scientific communities for using Galaxy and the funders for the support!
