The [COVID-19 Data Portal](https://www.covid19dataportal.org) emerged as an effort to coordinate data sharing to speed up the coronavirus research. It brings together relevant datasets submitted to EMBL-EBI and other major centres for biomedical data and constitutes an updated resource to which scientist can upload access and analyse reference data. 

The [__European Galaxy Server__](https://usegalaxy.eu/) is now listed as part of the [_"Computing support resources"_](https://www.covid19dataportal.org/related-resources). Under the _"Analysis tools"_, the __COVID-19 analysis on Galaxy Server__ can be found, and the __COVID-19 analysis on Galaxy__ under _"Standard for data sharing"_. An _"ELIXIR publications"_ is also listed: [__No more business as usual: Agile and effective responses to emerging pathogen threats require open data and open analytics__](https://journals.plos.org/plospathogens/article?id=10.1371/journal.ppat.1008643).
