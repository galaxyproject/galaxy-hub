__Akanksha Bafna__ from the [MRC Harwell Institute, Neurobehavioural Genetics, Oxfordshire, United Kingdom](https://www.har.mrc.ac.uk/) uses Galaxy for Circadian research. Thanks Akanksha!


> I’m a circadian biologist which means that often I am dealing with NGS dataset coming from biological samples collected at varied time-points, spread  uniformly across 24 hour period. To make my research reliable and robust, as a practice I prefer to conduct my experiments on independent biological replicates. As a result, I require reasonable disk quota to run and analyse my dataset. Further, Galaxy gives me the privilege to understand and analyse my data, without prior knowledge of command line or coding. This offers great advantage to biologist like me who would like to analyse the dataset keeping in mind the biological question.
