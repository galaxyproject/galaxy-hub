It's with incredible sadness that we need to notify you that Christophe Caron passed away. He suffered a heart attack during a football game last Friday.

Christophe was a driving force in the French bioinformatics community and the IFB, the French ELIXIR Node. He always advocated and pushed for collaboration, both within France as internationally. He was the funding father of many projects, including Workflow4Metabolomics. It was a pleasure working with Christophe. His enthusiasm, his passion and his dynamic way of working inspired entire communities. But also because of his "joie de vivre": he knew how to have a good time and how to welcome people. Something many of us had the pleasure of experiencing.

Our thoughts are with his family and friends. We will miss Christophe...

In commemorating and mourning,
