Hello all,

Welcome to the June 2021 edition of Galaxy News.  GCC2021 is upon us, **[with deadlines and events starting this month](#featured-news)**.  It's not too late to register (register by June 8 and get 50% off) and to submit Poster/Demo abstracts.  Training week starts on June 28. We also started getting confirmations from speakers and are **[publishing confirmed presenters](#featured-news)** as we get them. We are also pleased to **[announce our first three sponsors for GCC2021: F1000Research, GigaScience Press and KWS-SAAT](#gcc2021-sponsorships)**.

In addition to GCC news, we also released the **[James Taylor birthday video](#community-news)**, and have several **[new open positions](#community-news)**, lots of **[event news](#event-news)**, **[Galaxy platform news](#galaxy-platforms-news)**, **[Galactic blog posts](#galactic-blog-activity)**, **[training and doc updates](#doc-hub-and-training-updates)**,
recent **[open-access Galaxy-related publications](#publications)**, and **[new releases](#releases).**

As always, thanks for using Galaxy,

Dave Clements and Beatriz Serrano-Solano, Editors

[GCC2021 Dates: Training Starts June 28](https://www.vibconferences.be/events/gcc2021)

</div>

**The [2021 Galaxy Community Conference](https://www.vibconferences.be/events/gcc2021) is almost upon us.  GCC2021 will be held 28 June through July 10.    Here are the dates you need to know over the next 5 weeks:**

**June ~~1~~ 8: Early registration closes**

[Register by __June 8__ and save 50% off of the full rates](/news/2021-05-gcc-reg/). Registration [discounts are available to researchers from low and lower-middle income countries](/news/2021-05-gcc-reg/#participants-based-in-low-lower-middle-and-upper-middle-income-countries). For everyone else, registration is downright cheap too, starting at €15.00 for the training week and in €25.00 for the 3-day conference (plus VAT). *The [CoFest](https://sched.co/iLKn) is free.*

**June 14: Poster/Demo Abstracts Due**

We welcome [poster/demo submissions](/news/2021-05-gcc-posterdemo/) that use, implement or extend the Galaxy platform and ecosystem, including integrating and analyzing datasets in any research area, enhancing reproducibility in computational analyses, and fostering collaboration in scientific workflow development

Poster/Demos will be presented live at Remo.co tables and will not be limited to a single large PDF.  They are an opportunity to fully communicate your work. [Submit your abstract now](https://www.vibconferences.be/events/gcc2021-virtual-edition#abstracts).


**June 17: CoFest Prep Day**

The *June Paper Cuts Day* is now  the [GCC2021 CoFest Prep Day](/events/2021-06-papercuts/) for CoFest participants to create plans for the [GCC2021 CoFest](https://sched.co/iLKn). The CoFest will loosely organized around *clusters* -- shared areas of interest. [Find, propose, or guide your cluster ahead of time](/news/2021-05-gcc-cofest-call/), and at prep day.


**June 25: All Registration Closes**

So, [register](https://www.vibconferences.be/events/gcc2021) by then, OK?


**June 28: Training Week Starts**

GCC2021 [Training Week](https://galaxyproject.org/events/gcc2021/training) runs from June 28 through July 2. [Galaxy for Scientists](https://galaxyproject.org/events/gcc2021/training/science-track), [Galaxy for Developers](https://galaxyproject.org/events/gcc2021/training/dev-track), and [Galaxy for Admins](https://galaxyproject.org/events/gcc2021/training/admin-track) tracks are offered (and you can swap back forth between the Scientists and Developers tracks).  Lectures will be prerecorded, with live help available on chat for the week. This enables participants to learn at their own pace, avoids scheduling conflicts that are inherent with multi-track training, and enables those with low bandwidth internet connections to fully participate.  Training Week requires a separate registration from the meeting.

**July 7: Three Day Meeting Starts**

Featuring accepted full and lightning talks, poster/demo presentations, sponsors, birds-of-a-feather gatherings, and plenty of time for networking, the GCC2021 meeting is a three day event that brings the Galaxy Community together to share our work and address common challenges in data intensive science.   I

The meeting is [virtual, affordable, and globally accessible](/news/2021-02-gcc-virtual/) no matter what time zone or country you live in.

**July 9: Two Day CollaborationFest Starts**

GCC2021 wraps up with [a two-day collaborative work event](https://sched.co/iLKn) that aims to broaden the Galaxy contributor community, and to extend and improve all aspects of the Galaxy ecosystem.  The CoFest includes training, documentation, best practice workflows, community infrastructure, tools, and of course code.

Galaxy has always had Google-translated tutorials, but we are now embarking on a project to assess the learning experience with human-translated, vs Google-translated, bioinformatics tutorials. We are aiming to survey usage and utility in a workshop for native Spanish speakers.

The project started with Anna Syme's [A short introduction to Galaxy](https://training.galaxyproject.org/training-material/topics/introduction/tutorials/galaxy-intro-short/tutorial.html), and produced [Breve introducción a Galaxy - en español](https://training.galaxyproject.org/training-material/topics/introduction/tutorials/galaxy-intro-short/tutorial_ES.html). Many thanks to Wendi Bacon, Beatriz Serrano-Solano,  Patricia Carvajal López, Alejandra Escobar-Zepeda, Saskia Hiltemann, and Helena Rasche for making this happen.

Convolutional neural networks are specifically tailored to image and video processing tasks. This material explains what convolutional neural networks are, discusses their architecture, and solves an image classification problem using a CNN in Galaxy.

BioBlend ([Sloggett et al. 2013](https://training.galaxyproject.org/training-material/topics/dev/tutorials/bioblend-dev/tutorial.html#Sloggett2013)) is a Python library to enable simple interaction with Galaxy via the command line or scripts. This tutorial covers the basics behind BioBlend and the Galaxy API from a developer perspective, and demonstrates how to implement a simple method in BioBlend.

**This is the 200th tutorial in the Galaxy Training Network Library.**

[Galaxy Helm Chart v4.0](/news/2021-05-galaxy-helm-chart-v4/)

</div>

The Galaxy Helm chart automates the mechanics of deploying Galaxy into a single package. The same package can be used to deploy Galaxy for development, testing, or production. With v4, the chart also introduces improvements for managing Galaxy over time.

See this [blog post](/news/2021-05-galaxy-helm-chart-v4/) by Alex Mahmoud, Nuwan Goonasekera, Keith Suderman, and Enis Afgan for details.

[Nebulizer 0.7.0](https://pypi.org/project/nebulizer/0.7.0/)

</div>

[Nebulizer](https://nebulizer.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) is a Python utility which provides a high-level interactive command-line interface to remotely administer Galaxy servers.  It is built on top of the [BioBlend library](https://bioblend.readthedocs.io/en/stable/index.html) and offers an interface and range of functionality that complements the lower-level interfaces offered by [Ephemeris](https://ephemeris.readthedocs.io/en/latest/index.html) and [Parsec](https://parsec.readthedocs.io/en/latest/index.html).
