The Galaxy community is broad and diverse. Contributors to the main code, admins, tool developers, trainers, students... we are spread all over the world!  

This global open-source effort has its core values in the __accessibility__ of analysis tools for everyone, __reproducibility__ of the scientific pipelines, __transparency__, and __shareability__ of the results with others. These values can only be accomplished thanks to an awesome community.

A sneak peek of the community has recorded __different ways of becoming part of the Galaxy community__, with suggestions for newcomers:

- __If you are a scientist__, there are plenty of communities that you can join: genomics, proteomics, single-cell, plants, ecology, climate science, imaging, chemoinformatics, metabolomics, ...
- __If you are (or want to become) a developer__, there are also events for you! [Developers roundtables](https://galaxyproject.org/community/devroundtable/), [Paper Cuts day](https://galaxyproject.org/events/cofests/papercuts/)...
- __If you are (or want to become) an admin__ you can join the Galaxy Admin Training, help with the [training materials](https://training.galaxyproject.org/training-material/topics/admin/)...
- __If you are a trainer__, there are many opportunities with material ready to go in the [Galaxy Training Network (GTN)](https://training.galaxyproject.org/), and you can also contribute your own tutorials for others to learn and teach.
- __If you want to learn__, the [GTN](https://training.galaxyproject.org/) is your place! Plenty of training materials that you can follow at your own pace. For questions, the community can help you in the [Galaxy Help forum](https://help.galaxyproject.org/) too!
- __If you are just curious and would like to meet the community__, join our Matrix channels, attend the [Galaxy Community Conference](https://www.vibconferences.be/events/gcc2021-virtual-edition), [webinars](https://galaxyproject.org/events/webinars/), and/or [follow us on Twitter](https://twitter.com/galaxyproject)!
