[*Sex differences in peripheral not
central immune responses to paininducing
injury*](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-017-16664-z).

It is not clear whether this is due to differences in higher level
cognitive processes or basic nociceptive responses. In this study we used a
mouse model of neuropathic pain to dissociate these factors. We performed
RNA-seq on purified peripheral afferent neurons, but found no striking differences
in gene expression between male and female mice, neither before nor
after nerve injury. Similarly, spinal cord immune responses between the
sexes appeared to be indistinguishable when studied by flow cytometry or
qRT-PCR. Differences emerged only upon studying peripheral immune cell
infiltration into the dorsal root ganglion, suggesting that adaptive
immune responses in neuropathic pain could be sexually dimorphic.
