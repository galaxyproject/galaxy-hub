The [__ELIXIR Galaxy Community__](https://elixir-europe.org/communities/galaxy) started in 2018 from the Galaxy Working Group, founded in 2015. Since then, the community has expanded a lot and we have updated the ELIXIR website including the __goals__ (we outgrown the old ones!) with a special emphasis on the interactions with the __local, domain-specific and global communities__. Of course, providing __infrastructure__, constant improvement of __tools__ and easy __access to data__ has always been a must! 

The new website also lists the recent __accomplishments__: [__Pulsar__](https://pulsar-network.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) is now a reality and the integration with ELIXIR resources has been enhanced. In terms of training, and besides the success of the [__GTN__](https://training.galaxyproject.org/) tutorials, new __massive online training events__ are happening over the pandemic. Much more [__SARS-CoV-2 related resources__](https://covid19.galaxyproject.org/) have been collected as well since the response of the Galaxy community to the COVID-19 pandemic has been amazing!

__Thanks, ELIXIR Galaxy Community for all the great work!__
