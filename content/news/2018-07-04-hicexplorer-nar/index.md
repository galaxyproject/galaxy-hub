## Abstract

Galaxy HiCExplorer is a web server that facilitates the study of the 3D conformation of chromatin
by allowing Hi-C data processing, analysis and visualization. With the Galaxy HiCExplorer web server,
users with little bioinformatic background can perform every step of the analysis in one
workflow: mapping of the raw sequence data, creation of Hi-C contact matrices, quality assessment,
correction of contact matrices and identification of topological associated domains (TADs) and
A/B compartments. Users can create publication ready plots of the contact matrix, A/B compartments,
and TADs on a selected genomic locus, along with additional information like gene tracks or ChIP-seq signals.
Galaxy HiCExplorer is freely usable at: [https://hicexplorer.usegalaxy.eu](https://hicexplorer.usegalaxy.eu)
and is available as a Docker container:
[https://github.com/deeptools/docker-galaxy-hicexplorer](https://github.com/deeptools/docker-galaxy-hicexplorer).
