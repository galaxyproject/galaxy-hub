In the past few updates to Galaxy, many exiting changes and additions have arrived to workflows.

In this article, we'd like to shine a spotlight on three of them, which we are particularly excited about!

## 🤯 Is that a workflow on the community hub?

It sure is! And it's also the first feature we'd like to show you: **Workflow Embeds**

<iframe title="Galaxy Workflow Embed" style="width: 100%; height: 700px; border: none;" src="https://usegalaxy.eu/published/workflow?id=6e0330de5d80e619&embed=true&buttons=true&about=false&heading=true&minimap=true&zoom_controls=true&initialX=-20&initialY=-20&zoom=0.5"></iframe>

This is the workflow editor, hosted on usegalaxy.eu, embedded inside the community hub (this site!).
You can drag it around, zoom in and out, view the workflow on usegalaxy.eu, or download it directly here, all fully interactive.

This does not just work on the community hub, it works on any website. Galaxy workflows are now fully embedable, like a YouTube video embed.

Powering this embed is the workflow editor in a read-only mode.

## 🤔 How do I make my own embeds?

Embeds can easily be created from the workflow publishing page.
Go to the list of your workflows, and click "Share".

_notice how this list looks a bit different to before? Hold that thought_

Now make sure "Make workflow accessible" is turned on, and scroll down to the all new "Embed Workflow" section.

### ✅ Embed Options

There's a bunch of options to customize the embed. The defaults are fine for most cases, but here's a brief explanation of what these all do:

-   Show Heading: display a heading, showing either the workflows name, or "Workflow Preview" depending on if the about section is visible.
-   Show About: show or hide the about section. If the about section is active, shows the workflows name there, instead of in the heading.
-   Show Buttons: display the "Download" and "View in Galaxy" buttons.
-   Show Minimap: whether to show the minimap (bottom-right) inside the embedded workflow editor.
-   Show Zoom Controls: whether to show the zoom controls (bottom-left) inside the embedded workflow editor.
-   Initial Position: the x, y position shown before the user has dragged the canvas.
-   Initial Zoom: the zoom level shown, before the user zoomed in or out.
-   Add Basic Styling: adds a width, height, and removes the border of the embed. This is required for most websites, unless they have their own styling for the embed, or you want to use your own, custom, styling.
