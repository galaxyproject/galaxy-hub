At the [EOSC Symposium 2025](https://eosc.eu/news/lets-seize-this-moment-momentum-made-visible-at-eosc-symposium-2025/) in Brussels, the programme spotlighted the first wave of EOSC Nodes and the momentum behind the Federation’s launch. Roksana Wilk presented “From National Resources to EOSC: The EOSC Node Poland Gateway,” positioning the Polish node within EOSC’s broader move from plans to operations. 

The demo and accompanying video walk through a complete workflow on [eosc.pl](https://eosc.pl/):

1. Integrate data into [Onedata](https://onedata.org/#/home) spaces and catalogue.
2. Select datasets via [data.eosc.pl](https://data.eosc.pl/ozw/onezone/i#/login).
3. Choose environment.
4. Run analysis by configuring [Onedata](https://onedata.org/#/home) as [a source in Galaxy](https://training.galaxyproject.org/training-material/hall-of-fame/lopiola/).
5. Gather results back to [Onedata](https://onedata.org/#/home) as [RO-Crate](https://www.researchobject.org/ro-crate/) with provenance.
6. Publish via the [eosc.pl](https://eosc.pl/) catalogue for discovery and reuse.
