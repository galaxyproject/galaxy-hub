tease: "At the EOSC Symposium 2025, the Polish EOSC Node demonstrated a complete FAIR research workflow powered by Galaxy and PLGrid’s Pulsar integrating data analysis, execution, and provenance tracking through Onedata. The presentation video and full details are available via the [EOSC Node - Poland](https://eosc.pl/search/all_collection?q=EOSC%20Symposium%20Demo)."

At the [EOSC Symposium 2025](https://eosc.eu/news/lets-seize-this-moment-momentum-made-visible-at-eosc-symposium-2025/) in Brussels, the programme spotlighted the first wave of EOSC Nodes and the momentum behind the Federation’s launch. Roksana Wilk presented “From National Resources to EOSC: The EOSC Node Poland Gateway,” positioning the Polish node within EOSC’s broader move from plans to operations. 

The demo video walked through a complete research workflow using [EOSC Node - Poland](https://eosc.pl/) and [Galaxy EU](https://usegalaxy.eu):

1. Discover datasets with the help of [eosc.pl](https://eosc.pl) catalogue.
2. Integrate remote data into [Onedata](https://onedata.org/#/home) spaces using the Node's data portal ([data.eosc.pl](https://data.eosc.pl).
3. Choose an environment for analysis.
4. Configure [Onedata](https://onedata.org/#/home) as [a source in Galaxy](https://training.galaxyproject.org/training-material/hall-of-fame/lopiola/).
5. Run analysis on [Galaxy](https://usegalaxy.eu/).
6. Gather results back to [Onedata](https://onedata.org/#/home) as an [RO-Crate](https://www.researchobject.org/ro-crate/) with provenance.
7. Package the inputs, results, and provenance metadata into an RO-Crate and publish via the [eosc.pl](https://eosc.pl/) catalogue for discovery and reuse.
