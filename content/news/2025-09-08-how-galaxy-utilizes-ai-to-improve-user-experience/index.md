# How Galaxy Utilizes AI to Improve User Experience

Artificial intelligence (AI) is transforming not only how scientists analyze their data, but also how they **interact with scientific platforms**. Within the Galaxy Project, AI is being applied to improve the user experience itself—helping researchers debug analyses, discover relevant tools, and collaborate more efficiently. These innovations ensure that the platform is not only powerful, but also intuitive and supportive of the diverse needs of biomedical researchers.

## AI in Everyday Life: A Familiar Assistant

Most of us already interact with AI systems every day. Recommendation engines on streaming services, virtual assistants on smartphones, and autocorrect in text messaging are all examples of AI working behind the scenes to **smooth the user experience**. Importantly, these systems are designed not to replace the user, but to augment their abilities.

Galaxy’s AI-driven features serve a similar purpose. They don’t perform the scientific discovery for you, but they help researchers **navigate complexity, save time, and avoid pitfalls** while using Galaxy. Just as autocomplete makes writing less error-prone, Galaxy’s AI tools make computational research more approachable.

## The Job Error Wizard: AI-Powered Debugging

One of the most prominent AI enhancements is the **[Job Error Wizard](https://github.com/galaxyproject/galaxy/blob/dev/client/src/components/GalaxyWizard.vue)** (formerly ChatGXY). This AI assistant uses large language models (LLMs) to **interpret job failure messages and logs**, providing human-readable explanations and actionable suggestions. Instead of cryptic error codes, researchers receive guidance like: *“Your FASTQ file appears to be truncated; try re-uploading or validating the file.”* This not only accelerates problem-solving but also turns each error into a **learning opportunity**. For researchers who may not have extensive computational training, this feature is designed to dramatically reduce frustration and foster proactive solutions.

## The Galaxy MCP Server: Opening Doors for AI Agents

Another key innovation is the **[Model Context Protocol (MCP) server](https://github.com/galaxyproject/galaxy-mcp)**. Through MCP, external AI systems can connect to Galaxy and carry out actions such as:

- Searching for tools relevant to a research question  
- Launching workflows with specified parameters  
- Querying datasets or retrieving results programmatically  

This creates the foundation for **AI copilots** that can assist researchers directly inside Galaxy. Imagine describing your goal in plain language—*“I want to compare differential gene expression between these two conditions”*—and having an AI agent suggest or even build a suitable workflow for you.

## AI for Smarter Training and Onboarding

The [Galaxy Training Network (GTN)](https://training.galaxyproject.org/) already provides hundreds of curated tutorials. Integrating AI into this ecosystem could offer dynamic support—automatically recommending the next tutorial based on your previous analyses, or answering contextual “how do I…” questions directly within the platform. 

Such features echo the personalized learning experiences we see in mainstream education apps, where AI tailors lesson plans to individual learners. For Galaxy, this could mean **adaptive scientific training**, ensuring that every user, from student to seasoned researcher, has the right guidance at the right time.

## A Research Assistant, Not a Replacement

In Galaxy, AI is explicitly designed to **complement—not replace—researchers**. The Job Error Wizard doesn’t interpret the biological data; it helps you run the tools correctly. The MCP server doesn’t decide your hypotheses; it helps you set up workflows that test them. These systems act as **scaffolding**: they hold up the technical complexity so that researchers can focus on the biological questions that matter most.

## The Road Ahead: Community-Driven AI in Galaxy

As with all things Galaxy, the future of AI-driven features will be **community-driven**. The [machine learning & AI special interest group](https://galaxyproject.org/community/sig/ml-ai-across-galaxy/) continues to explore new opportunities for integrating AI into the platform—whether that’s developing domain-specific models, designing smarter user interfaces, or creating AI-enhanced reproducibility checks.

## Conclusion

Galaxy has always prioritized accessibility, reproducibility, and collaboration. With the addition of AI-driven features, the platform is now also prioritizing **usability and researcher empowerment**. From automated error diagnosis to AI-assisted workflow construction, these innovations represent the next step in making Galaxy not only a hub for data analysis but also a **partner in scientific discovery**.

By embracing AI to enhance the user experience, Galaxy is ensuring that researchers can navigate the growing complexity of biomedical data with confidence and ease.
