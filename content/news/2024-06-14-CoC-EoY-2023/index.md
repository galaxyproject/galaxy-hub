Lack of incidents being reported does not necessarily mean lack of incidents. 
Please feel free to get in touch with the CoC Committee if you think that there have been incidents that have not yet been raised.


## Changes to Code Of Conduct committee
Change in membership - Assunta DeSanto has left the committee.

## Procedures for changes to Code of Conduct
CoC Committee members are now listed as codeowners of the file, ensuring that we are aware of any requested changes, and preventing 
committee members from changing things without review. Review and update window will be held annually starting at GCC each year at a Bird of a Feather event (co-responding async document will be available for members who are not attending GCC in person).  The proposed changes will be shared in the Hub and we will solicit feedback for up to two months. Afterwards, the CoC will vote on the proposed changes and inputs, and ask the Exec Board to ratify our changes. Following the changes, we will publish the updates to the CoC, any incidents that took place and their outcome, and the minutes from Code of Conduct meetings.
