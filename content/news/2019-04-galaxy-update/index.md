# GCC2019 Registration & Abstract Submission

**We are pleased to announce that [registration](/events/gcc2019/registration/) and [abstract submission](/events/gcc2019/abstracts/) for the [2019 Galaxy Community Conference (GCC2019)](/events/gcc2019/) are now open.**

[<img class="float-right" style="max-width: 300px" src="/events/gcc2019/gcc2019-logo-big.png" alt="GCC2019" />](/events/gcc2019/)

GCC2019 will be held 1-6 July in Freiburg, Germany.  The *tenth* [GCC](/events/gcc2019/) will have many familiar features from earlier years, including accepted and lightning talks, posters and demos, birds-of-a-feather gatherings (BoFs), training, and a CollaborationFest.  GCC2019 brings the [most significant conference program update](https://gcc2019.sched.com/) in several years:

* some training will be integrated with the main conference,
* three days of conference instead of two,
* several parallel sessions,
* and a strong emphasis on organizing content by domain.

GCC2019, like every GCC before it, will be built around **community**.  Training topics are nominated, selected, and presented by the community.  Presentations will  feature the full spectrum of Galaxy applications, enhancements and deployments from the community as well.

If you are working in data intensive life science research then there will not be a better place to share your work, learn from others, and find new collaborators.

Please find additional information on GCC2019 [here](/events/gcc2019/).

# GCC2019 Sponsors

We are very pleased to welcome **[Limagrain](https://www.limagrain.com/en/)** as a [Silver Sponsor for GCC2019](/events/gcc2019/sponsors/).

## Limagrain

[<img class="float-left img-fluid mx-auto" style="max-width: 300px" src="/images/logos/limagrain-logo-text.png" alt="Limagrain: From earth to life" />](https://www.limagrain.com/en/)

As the fourth largest seed company worldwide, **[Limagrain](https://www.limagrain.com/en/)**’s mission is to move agriculture forward to meet global food related challenges. Limagrain is a cooperative group founded and managed by French farmers. Its parent company, Coopérative Limagrain, brings together nearly 2,000 farmers located in the center of France, in the Limagne Val d'Allier plain. The Group creates, produces and distributes field seeds, vegetable seeds and cereal products. Limagrain is present in 56 countries and has more than 10,000 employees. It makes nearly 2.5 billion Euros of sales with recognized brands on their markets: LG, Vilmorin, Hazera, Harris Moran, Jacquet, Brossard.

After participating for several years, Limagrain has the pleasure to help out with the Galaxy Community Conference organization for the first time ever. With over 200 Limagrain users worldwide and hundreds of tools dedicated to agronomic research, Galaxy has become central to Bioinformatics and Bioanalysis platforms of Limagrain research activities. By leveraging access to sequencing data of the plant species and by  gathering tools and workflows tailored towards breeding, Galaxy is key to Limagrain competitiveness.

## Your Organization/Vendor Here!

[GCC2019](/events/gcc2019/) is looking for [sponsors](/events/gcc2019/sponsors/)!  If your organization wants to help put on the premier Galaxy event of the year, then please contact the [organizers](/events/gcc2019/sponsors/)). And please encourage your vendors to consider sponsoring as well.  Sponsors are potential partners for participants and their contributions make GCC affordable (and maybe even possible).

# Galaxy Platforms News

The [Galaxy Platform Directory](/use/) lists resources for easily running your analysis on Galaxy, including publicly available servers, cloud services, and containers and VMs that run Galaxy.  A lot was added in March:

[<img class="float-right" style="max-width: 300px" src="/use/graphclust/graphclust-pipeline.png" alt="graphclust" />](/use/graphclust/)

## GraphClust

The [GraphClust2 server](/use/graphclust/) is a workflow for scalable clustering of RNAs based on sequence and secondary structures feature. [GraphClust2 is implemented within the Galaxy framework](https://graphclust.usegalaxy.eu/) and consists a set of integrated Galaxy tools and flavors of the linear-time clustering workflow.

## Language Analysis Portal

The language analysis portal (LAP) provides an intuitive and easy-to-use [web interface](https://www.mn.uio.no/ifi/english/research/projects/clarino/) to a centralized repository of a wide range of language technology tools, all installed on a high-performance computing (HPC) cluster.  Users are able to compose and run workflows using an in-browser graphical interface, with multiple tools and resources chained together in potentially complex pipelines.  Although the project reaches out to a diverse set of user groups, it particularly aims to facilitate use of language analysis in the social sciences, humanities, and other fields without strong computational traditions.

## CAFU

[<img class="float-right" style="max-width: 300px" src="/use/cafu/cafu-overview-800.png" alt="cafu" />](/use/cafu/)

[CAFU](https://github.com/cma2015/CAFU) is a [Galaxy-based bioinformatics framework](http://bioinfo.nwafu.edu.cn:4001/) for comprehensive assembly and functional annotation of unmapped RNA-seq data from single- and mixed-species samples which integrates plenty of existing NGS analytical tools and our developed programs, and features an easy-to-use interface to manage, manipulate and most importantly, explore large-scale unmapped reads.


## Galaxy Platforms in Publications

We tag papers that use, mention, implement or extend public Galaxy platforms (servers, services, clouds, containers...).  Here are the counts for the past month's publications:

[CloudBridge](http://cloudbridge.cloudve.org/en/latest/) is a Python library that offers a uniform interface to major Infrastructure-as-a-Service (IaaS) cloud providers. CloudBridge ensures operational consistency across the supported providers allowing the same code to run consistently across multiple cloud providers. With this release, CloudBridge supports Amazon Web Service (AWS), Microsoft Azure, OpenStack, and now Goodle cloud. This release is further characterized by improved code consistency.
