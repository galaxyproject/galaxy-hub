We are one out of five German [de.NBI cloud](www.denbi.de/cloud) centers that provides storage and compute resources for the life science community. Thanks to a new [de.NBI](https://www.denbi.de) grant, the European Galaxy Server now has extended CPU memory and storage resources. Expect less waiting time in the queue, smoother big training events and more power for your research!

Thanks to our local [compute center](http://www.hpc.uni-freiburg.de/) for all their help on our way!

More information about the de.NBI cloud can be found [here](https://www.denbi.de/cloud).
