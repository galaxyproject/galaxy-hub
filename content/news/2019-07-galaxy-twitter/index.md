The recent addition of a [new Twitter account for the Galaxy Training Network](https://twitter.com/gxytraining) makes this a good time to talk about Galaxy's presence on Twitter.  Why might this matter?  Let's start with two quotes that nicely sum up the usefulness of Twitter in bioinformatics:

<div class="blockquote trim-p">

**Twitter** is one of the most important bioinformatics tools you can use.

and

**Twitter** is the world's largest lab meeting.

Twitter is a great way to keep current with what's happening in the Galaxy community (as well as in science in general). Twitter is instantaneous, and it is often the first place where news and information is posted.  It is also *voluminous* and this can also make it overwhelming.  So, to help you get the most out of Twitter, here is a quick guide to *Galaxy on Twitter*.

<sup>*</sup> This could have been you!  Please let us know if it was.

# What do you want to see?

## I want it all!  The #UseGalaxy hashtag

Hashtags (they start with a `#`) can be used by anyone and indicate that a tweet is relevant to a particular topic.  The [#UseGalaxy hashtag](https://twitter.com/hashtag/UseGalaxy) is used on any tweet that is related to Galaxy in any way.  *And it is.*  #usegalaxy shows up in over 100 posts per week.  If you want the full story, then search for #usegalaxy.

## I want to be in the know: The @galaxyproject account

[<img class="float-right" style="max-width: 64px" src="/images/galaxy-logos/galaxy_project_logo_square_no_text.png" alt="Galaxy Project on Twitter" />](https://twitter.com/galaxyproject)

The [@galaxyproject account](https://twitter.com/galaxyproject) is the project's "official" Twitter channel.  We (Dave C, Martin C, Mo H, Nicola S, and Hans-Rudolf H) use this channel to announce events, news, publications, and resources that we think will be of interest to the Galaxy community.  This account sends between 25 and 50 tweets and retweets per month (except during [GCC](https://galaxyproject.org/gcc/), when that number goes way up).

## I'm Interested In Particular Communities

Several communities within Galaxy have their own presence on Twitter.  These are used for particular geographies, resources, or topic interests:

# Got something to say?

Twitter is not a passive platform (you may have heard that already :-).  If you have news that's relevant to the Galaxy community then please include the **#UseGalaxy** hashtag, or one of the other accounts or hashtags if those are more relevant.


# Keeping up without drowning: TweetDeck

We recommend [TweetDeck](https://tweetdeck.twitter.com/) for using Twitter.  TweetDeck lets you track multiple accounts and hashtags simultaneously, each in its own column.


See you on Twitter,
