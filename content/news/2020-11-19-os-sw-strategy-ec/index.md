The European Commission has recently approved the Open Source Software Strategy. A selection of the press release:

> *The internal strategy, under the theme ‘’Think Open’’, sets out a vision for encouraging and leveraging the transformative, innovative and collaborative power of open source, its principles and development practices. It promotes the sharing and reuse of software solutions, knowledge and expertise, to deliver better European services that benefit society and lower costs to that society. The Commission commits to increasing its use of open source not only in practical areas such as IT, but also in areas where it can be strategic.*

As an ambassador for Open Science, the European Galaxy project is welcoming this decision and will fully support this strategy.
