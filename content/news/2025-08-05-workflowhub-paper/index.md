In a world drowning in data, researchers are under mounting pressure to deliver reproducible, scalable analyses. Computational workflows – the coded recipes that turn data into scientific insight – have become essential. They serve as both a record of what was done and a reusable map for anyone trying to run the same analysis again. Workflow adoption has skyrocketed across domains including biosciences, astronomy and the physical sciences and the number of workflow management systems has exploded from a few systems two decades ago to hundreds today. And as the [EuroScienceGateway (ESG) project](https://galaxyproject.org/projects/esg/) rightly notes, scientists today face a jungle of data sources, tools and infrastructures; many lack the computing skills to harness high‑performance or cloud platforms. The demand for FAIR (findable, accessible, interoperable and reusable) data and workflows is growing.

Yet there is a bottleneck. But these workflows are scattered across GitHub repositories, institutional websites and journals. They are described inconsistently, making them hard to find, and the lack of standardised metadata stalls discovery and reuse. This fragmentation leads to duplication of effort and slows the translation of data into knowledge. Even when scientists want to share their workflows, there is no single, trusted registry that assigns credit, enforces FAIR practices and connects with the myriad of workflow execution platforms. [Houston, we have a problem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Houston,_we_have_a_problem): how can the research community avoid reinventing the wheel and support reproducibility at scale?

# WorkflowHub: A Unified Registry

The paper [“WorkflowHub: a registry for computational workflows”](https://doi.org/10.1038/s41597-025-04786-3) published in Scientific Data on 21 May 2025 tackles this issue head‑on. The authors argue that the rising popularity of workflows is driven by the need for repetitive and scalable data processing and transparent methods. However, workflows are scattered and hard to find. [WorkflowHub](https://workflowhub.eu/) is presented as a public and inclusive registry dedicated to sharing computational workflows across all scientific domains. It is deliberately agnostic to workflow language, management system or discipline, meaning a Galaxy workflow, a Snakemake pipeline or a custom Python script are equally welcome.

At the heart of [WorkflowHub](https://workflowhub.eu/) is a simple value proposition: make workflows FAIR and give credit where credit is due. The registry integrates with Git repositories and community platforms like [nf‑core](https://nf-co.re/) and the [Intergalactic Workflow Commission](https://iwc.galaxyproject.org/), allowing developers to import workflows directly. It supports citation infrastructure (CITATION.cff, DOIs and [ORCID](https://orcid.org/) IDs) so that authors receive scholarly credit. Each workflow entry contains rich metadata, version history, license information and ontology annotations. [WorkflowHub](https://workflowhub.eu/) does more than just storage – it connects workflows to digital objects such as publications, Standard Operating Procedures (SOPs) and data sets, enabling researchers to see the full context. The platform uses modern web‑friendly standards like [Bioschemas](https://bioschemas.org/), [Research Object Crates (RO‑Crate)](https://www.researchobject.org/ro-crate/) and the [GA4GH Tools Registry Service](https://www.ga4gh.org/product/tool-registry-service-trs/) to enable machine‑actionable [interoperability](https://galaxyproject.org/fair/interoperability/). In short, it serves as a hub linking the workflow ecosystem and easing the integration of diverse services.

# Global Adoption and the Numbers Behind the Success

Since its launch in 2020 under the [EOSC‑Life Workflow Collaboratory](https://www.tib-op.org/ojs/index.php/CoRDI/article/view/352), [WorkflowHub](https://workflowhub.eu/) has demonstrated rapid uptake. By the time of submission, the registry hosted 860 registered workflows, 958 users from 266 organisations across 36 countries. These workflows span life sciences, health sciences, engineering, earth sciences and computer sciences. Notably, more than 67 [COVID‑19‑related workflows](https://workflowhub.eu/search?q=COVID#workflows) helped researchers respond rapidly to the pandemic. This breadth proves that a domain‑agnostic registry can attract a diverse user base, from small research groups to large consortia.

[WorkflowHub](https://workflowhub.eu/)'s' [governance model](https://about.workflowhub.eu/project/community/) is inclusive and transparent: it is an [ELIXIR service](https://elixir-europe.org/services) supported by the [UK](https://elixir-europe.org/about-us/who-we-are/nodes/uk) and [Belgium](https://www.elixir-belgium.org/) ELIXIR nodes and the [Australian BioCommons](https://www.biocommons.org.au/). Governance is coordinated by the [WorkflowHub Club](https://about.workflowhub.eu/#community), an open community that meets biweekly and includes representatives from multiple institutions. Funding is secured through [Horizon Europe projects and national UK programmes](https://about.workflowhub.eu/project/acknowledgements/#funding), ensuring sustainability. The registry is built on the [FAIRDOM‑SEEK platform](https://fair-dom.org/fairdomseek) and is hosted on the University of Manchester’s Research IT cloud. These operational details demonstrate a commitment to open development, community leadership and long‑term support – qualities necessary for any research infrastructure.

# The EuroScienceGateway Connection

Why should the [ESG](https://galaxyproject.org/projects/esg/) community care about [WorkflowHub](https://workflowhub.eu/)? Because the registry is explicitly part of the [ESG project](https://galaxyproject.org/projects/esg/). ESG is building a distributed computing network across 13 European countries, accessible through six national instances, offering researchers access to compute, storage and data analysis platforms. One of [ESG](https://galaxyproject.org/projects/esg/)’s core objectives is to apply FAIR principles to workflows and adopt FAIR Digital Objects to stimulate reusable and reproducible research. [WorkflowHub](https://workflowhub.eu/) operationalises that objective by providing a centralised registry that makes workflows findable, assigns credit and packages them into machine‑actionable [RO‑Crates](https://www.researchobject.org/ro-crate/). In effect, [WorkflowHub](https://workflowhub.eu/) is the workflows pillar of [ESG](https://galaxyproject.org/projects/esg/)’s [Work Package 2](https://galaxyproject.org/projects/esg/news/?tag=esg-wp2), which aims to stimulate FAIR and reusable research.

[ESG](https://galaxyproject.org/projects/esg/) also emphasises user‑friendliness: many scientists lack the skills to navigate High Performance Computing (HPC) or cloud environments. [WorkflowHub](https://workflowhub.eu/) bridges that gap by integrating with execution platforms like [Galaxy](https://usegalaxy.eu/) and [Nextflow](https://www.nextflow.io/). [WorkflowHub](https://workflowhub.eu/)’s support for [RO‑Crates](https://www.researchobject.org/ro-crate/) and [FAIR digital objects](https://fairdo.org/) aligns perfectly with [ESG](https://galaxyproject.org/projects/esg/)’s mandate to produce EOSC‑catalogued FAIR data and workflows.

The synergy goes further. [WorkflowHub](https://workflowhub.eu/) is acknowledged as part of both EuroScienceGateway and [DARE‑UK TRE‑FX](https://dareuk.org.uk/how-we-work/previous-activities/dare-uk-phase-1-driver-projects/tre-fx-delivering-a-federated-network-of-trusted-research-environments-to-enable-safe-data-analytics/). It feeds into ESG deliverables such as [“EuroScienceGateway D2.1: Reproducible FAIR Digital Objects for Workflows”](https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.13225792), which emphasises packaging workflows as portable, citable research artefacts. For ESG, having a robust registry reduces duplication and lowers the learning curve for new users – two practical goals the project emphasises.

# Looking Ahead: Practical Implications for Researchers

From a project‑management perspective, [WorkflowHub](https://workflowhub.eu/) offers a comprehensive, scalable solution to a pervasive problem. It removes friction from workflow sharing, ensures credit assignment and fosters cross‑disciplinary collaboration. With hundreds of workflows already registered, the network effect will only strengthen; as more researchers contribute, discovery becomes easier and reuse more attractive. The bottom line: centralising workflows saves time and resources and speeds up discovery. In an era where duplication can burn budgets and delay results, that’s a competitive advantage.

For [ESG](https://galaxyproject.org/projects/esg/) stakeholders, adopting [WorkflowHub](https://workflowhub.eu/) is a no‑brainer. It embodies [FAIR principles](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FAIR_data), integrates with [Galaxy](https://usegalaxy.eu/) (the platform powering many [ESG](https://galaxyproject.org/projects/esg/) users) and directly supports [ESG](https://galaxyproject.org/projects/esg/)’s objectives around reproducibility and ease of use. Communities in [Work Package 5](https://galaxyproject.org/projects/esg/news/?tag=esg-wp5) of [ESG](https://galaxyproject.org/projects/esg/) can register their workflows, obtain DOIs, link to publications and data sets, and provide rich metadata without building bespoke infrastructure. At the same time, the registry’s open governance and sustainable funding mean that it will remain available long after individual projects conclude.

In conclusion, the Scientific Data paper serves as both a technical description and a call to action. It highlights the fragmented state of workflows but also provides a clear solution. Therefore, for the [ESG](https://galaxyproject.org/projects/esg/) community and beyond, [WorkflowHub](https://workflowhub.eu/) is not just another registry – it is a cornerstone for reproducible, FAIR science. By embracing [WorkflowHub](https://workflowhub.eu/), [ESG](https://galaxyproject.org/projects/esg/) can deliver on its promise of a robust, scalable, open research infrastructure and help European researchers thrive in the data‑driven era. Let’s stop reinventing the wheel and start building on each other’s work.
