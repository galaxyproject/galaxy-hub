Hello all,

The 2021 Galaxy Community Conference has started!  It is too late to register for the 3 day conference next week.  It is also officially too late to sign up for the CoFest on 9-10 July, but if you [follow this link](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLScdJHTzw7LWVxFaqGI30COZlcxGPksjGL_UDSwDNsQK1FVFCw/viewform), you just mind find yourself invited anyway.

This is one of our thinner newsletters, but there are still **[open positions](#community-news)**, **[event news](#event-news)**, **[Galaxy platform news](#galaxy-platforms-news)**, **[Galactic blog posts](#galactic-blog-activity)**, **[training and doc updates](#doc-hub-and-training-updates)**,
recent **[open-access Galaxy-related publications](#publications)**, **[new releases](#releases), and [other news too](#other-news).**

We hope to see you at GCC events this week and next.

Dave Clements and Beatriz Serrano-Solano, Editors

GCC2021 [Training Week](https://galaxyproject.org/events/gcc2021/training) is underway, and the GCC meeting and [CoFest](https://sched.co/iLKn) are next week.  If you registered in time, *then welcome to one of the coolest community get togethers in data-intensive science!*

If you didn't get registered then here is some hopefully consoling news:

* Training videos and materials are now available for free in the Galaxy Training Network library.
* Videos of all talks presented at GCC2021 will be made available online, for free later this summer.
* All slides and poster PDFs will be made available online this summer as well.

# Event News

Did we mention that the [2021 Galaxy Community Conference](https://www.vibconferences.be/events/gcc2021) is under way?  Just checking...

But even something as universe-spanning as GCC doesn't suck up all the oxygen in the Galaxy Community. Here are some other [upcoming events highlights](/events/):

<div class="card-deck">

**9-12 August**

The goal of this workshop is to build capacity in SARS-CoV-2 data analysis and data management, including data submission to ENA. After the workshop, all participants will be able to upload viral sequencing data, call all variants, create a variety of reports and create consensus alignments.

It will be a 4-day event introducing scalable and reproducible SARS-CoV-2 data analysis with Galaxy. The sessions will be pre-recorded and provided in advance. During the workshop, there will be live support in chat and live Q&A sessions, in which experts will answer questions.

Galaxy is now available in all flavors of the Terra platform.

"Today, we released an update that makes Galaxy available through the other “faces” of Terra, i.e. the project-agnostic [Terra Community Workbench](https://app.terra.bio/) and the [NHLBI BioData Catalyst](https://terra.biodatacatalyst.nhlbi.nih.gov/)..."  Galaxy has been available on the [AnVIL Terra Portal](https://anvil.terra.bio/) since last year.
