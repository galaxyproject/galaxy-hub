We were invited in July to give talks at the ISMB/ECCB organized by the International Society for Computational Biology. During the ELIXIR-hosted special session on "Scalable Plant-Research in Cloud Environments" we presented "Galaxy and the European Galaxy Community", "Apollo and Galaxy", and "e!DAL". We spent a really great day in Basel (CH).
