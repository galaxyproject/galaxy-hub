From [3 to 5 November 2025 in Brussels](https://eosc.eu/news/lets-seize-this-moment-momentum-made-visible-at-eosc-symposium-2025/), the [Data Terra Research Infrastructure](https://www.data-terra.org/) participated in the [EOSC Symposium 2025](https://eosc.eu/eosc-symposium-2025/), engaging with the wider EOSC ecosystem through its booth and demonstration talk. As the EOSC thematic node for environmental sciences, Data Terra presented services that strengthen the European research landscape, most notably the Galaxy platform, now integrated into the EOSC Federation.

During their lightning talk, **Marie Jossé ([CNRS](https://www.cnrs.fr/fr))** and **Jérôme Détoc ([Ifremer](https://www.ifremer.fr/en))** delivered a demonstration titled *“From Plume to Bloom: Data Terra RI × EOSC Federation.”* Their demonstration showed how [Earth System Galaxy subdomain](https://earth-system.usegalaxy.eu/), supports scientists in detecting and analysing extreme environmental events, transforming raw observation data into meaningful insights.

This demonstration highlighted the added value of Galaxy in orchestrating reproducible, cross-domain analyses of Earth-system data combining satellite, in-situ, and model sources within the federated EOSC environment. Through EOSC’s interoperable authentication and data access services, researchers can easily execute Galaxy workflows, visualise results, and share findings.
