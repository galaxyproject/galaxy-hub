This week, starting from Monday the 15th of February, the [Galaxy Training Network (GTN)](training.galaxyproject.org/) is running a global Galaxy online course: [__GTN Smörgåsbord__](https://shiltemann.github.io/global-galaxy-course/)[^1].

You can choose between many different training sessions along the week ranging from Genomics, Proteomics, or Ecology, to analysing and understanding climate-related scientific data. You can dive into the R-programming language and combine it with Galaxy, or play around with Python. All of that supported by video recordings in our [YouTube channel](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCwoMMZPbz1L9AZzvIvrvqYA), hands-on materials and a bunch of [experts](https://shiltemann.github.io/global-galaxy-course/#acknowledgements) supporting you during the entire week.

A total of __1080 participants__ from all over the world will be following the course:

If you are participating in the training, please [__consider using our data library to get the training datasets that you will need for the tutorials__](https://usegalaxy.eu/library/folders/Fa21272e5bd712216). This way, you will save time and we will have more bandwidth to share with other participants :-)



The load will be spread around three different Galaxy servers ([usegalaxy.eu](usegalaxy.eu), [usegalaxy.org.au](usegalaxy.org.au) and [usegalaxy.org](usegalaxy.org)). In all of them, you will find a very convenient way of __accessing the training materials__ through the hat in the header of the Galaxy server:

The format of this course will give you an overview of all the potential that you can achieve by analysing data with Galaxy. But this is only possible thanks to the amazing community behind the project. If you are wondering __how to become part of the Galaxy community__, take a look at this video for some ideas:
