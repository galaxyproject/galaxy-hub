With this article we would like to share Mona's experience with usegalaxy.eu and its use for her research.

>I am __Mona Malek Mohammadi__ from the [Institute of Physiology I, University Hospital Bonn](https://www.physiologie.uni-bonn.de/en/physiology?set_language=en).

>Our group's research focuses on understanding the mechanism of cardiac regeneration in neonatal mice. This is because neonatal mice at postnatal day 1 (P1) are able to regenerate the heart after injury or adapt to pressure overload, but this ability is lost seven days after birth. Given high mortality and morbidity rates upon cardiovascular diseases, our research aims to discover regenerative mechanisms in neonatal mice, to be able to discover new therapeutic strategies for humans in the future.

>Galaxy has been a great help in this regard, which allows us to analyze RNA sequencing data obtained from heart tissues and different cell types of the heart. Using Galaxy, we have been able to rapidly compare and cross different samples, thus having gained great insights into the mechanism of cardiac regeneration. Recently, we could publish a manuscript on our research:
