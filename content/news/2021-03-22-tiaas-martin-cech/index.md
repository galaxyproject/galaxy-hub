This has been a second time we've used this free service at ELIXIR Czech Republic and we couldn't be happier. Both times our use case was an afternoon-long workshop comprised of general introduction to Galaxy with hands-on parts and later a specialized session (cheminformatics/proteomics). The whole process of applying for the dedicated resources and its approval is very short and smooth. Enrollment of attendees to the dedicated queue is effortless and the added convenience of seeing everybody's jobs statuses provided me with much appreciated peace of mind.

Kudos to Galaxy Europe.
