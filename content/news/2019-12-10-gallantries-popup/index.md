The [Gallantries Project](https://galaxy-carpentries.github.io/gallantries/) recently had their final meeting in Thessaloniki, Greece!

During this meeting we [refactored the lessons for R, and RStudio](https://github.com/galaxyproject/training-material/pull/1672). Following feedback from previous workshops, we knew that these lessons needed some more real life testing in order to smooth out their rough edges, ensuring that the content would approachable for everyone. There were several folks at [INAB CERTH](http://www2.inab.certh.gr), the host for our meeting, who were interested in this topic. So we decided to give a last minute pop-up course on making volcano plots in R!

We received a lot of [useful feedback](https://github.com/galaxyproject/training-material/issues/1452#issuecomment-564506234) from these interactions which we will build into future versions of the lessons.

This was only possible thanks to UseGalaxy.eu, TIaaS, and their deployment of the RStudio interactive tool, the first of any Galaxy server to support this feature crucial to taking analyses from finished tables to paper-ready plots.

A heartfelt thanks from the whole Gallantries team, without Galaxy Europe we could not have done the super cool things we did.
