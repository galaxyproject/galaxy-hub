The [10th ELIXIR All Hands meeting](https://elixir-events.eventscase.com/EN/ahm2024) was held in Uppsala, Sweden, from June 10 to 12, 2024. The Galaxy Europe team attended this meeting,
which aimed to bring together members of the ELIXIR community from across the ELIXIR Nodes, as well as collaborators from partner organisations, to review ELIXIR's achievements and activities and discuss future plans.

In the [Deciphering federated analysis: What is it and how far it can take us](https://docs.google.com/document/d/13aCXWW8gnv9AYvPUDyOLO_oBQYacsW3EpJ9IKk5OzbM/) session on the first day, the participants discussed the following question. How can we conduct collaborative analysis while respecting data privacy and following data protection regulations? Multiple ELIXIR initiatives are working on federated analysis, which will solve this problem. The Galaxy Europe team, as part of the [EuroScienceGateway project](https://galaxyproject.org/projects/esg/), was present at this gathering. Dr. Björn Grüning presented [How Galaxy Can Be Used for Federated Analytics?](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1PBMeVux-ukXoCsj8mAaUf_c3oHWCYwgm5cpc37WTkY4/edit#slide=id.g2e3832b6d94_1_48) during this meeting. He discussed how the Galaxy architecture is similar to EUCAIM, as well as Pulsar Nodes, ELIXIR AAI, and the GA4GH TES Cluster, and the use of distributed nodes for various types of efficiency, including carbon efficiency. He also addressed the storage problem for federated data analysis and the Galaxy team's solutions, which include connecting to and selecting multiple public or personal storage alternatives via API, command line, and GUI, in addition to the temporarily expanding users' scratch space. Pulsar provides a varied collection of alternatives, including S3 storage from several countries, commercial S3, OneData, iRODS, and Rucio. In the same session, Dr. Tim Beck presented [the role of EOSC-ENTRUST in secure federated data analysis](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1PBMeVux-ukXoCsj8mAaUf_c3oHWCYwgm5cpc37WTkY4/edit#slide=id.g2e3832b6d94_1_53) and discussed [RO-Crate](https://www.researchobject.org/ro-crate/) and [workflow processing](https://workflowhub.eu/), which enable the interoperability framework and execution approach for practical pan-Trusted Research Environment (TRE) analysis.

On the second day of the event, the [Tackling single-cell data management and interoperability in Galaxy](https://docs.google.com/document/d/16ykadI4A8l4wrviaBunan4ujxU36sJCk5_ZUOZTw_XU/edit?tab=t.0#heading=h.gjdgxs) session discussed the advancements of analysis tool suites and the abundance of data. Poor interoperability of diverse single-cell data types has been identified as a challenge in this field. New tools and regular releases of R and Python tools bring new data formats, many of which lack backward compatibility, posing challenges for tutorial and workflow sustainability. In this session, ELIXIR members explored incorporating ELIXIR data management techniques and how to use available tools such as the ELIXIR single-cell RDM toolkit to assist users in standardizing RDM and data interoperability. Wendi Bacon and Pavankumar Videm [presented](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1CM0bFJFuYezVOqNyFsZp2BrsygGRYMs43p1ColbYihI/edit#slide=id.g268ba6ba735_0_0) the lifetime of single-cell data on Galaxy and explored the problems in standards and data formats. Participants in this workshop were divided into groups, led as well by Björn Grüning and Wolfgang Maier ran breakout groups, to create and test workflows and documentation, incorporate public metadata standards into the workflows, and expand the [ELIXIR-RDM toolkit page](https://rdmkit.elixir-europe.org/single_cell_sequencing) applicable standards. The output of these workflows was formatted in the research object crate (RO-Crate) format, which is compliant with ELIXIR specifications.

During the [Where is the dark matter? The Galaxy Community shedding light on activities, connections, scope, and unaddressed shortcomings](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1i5coxz4ubcMdMr5E4v6OVPqbHs2S7ujOVnkRj6I33Cg/edit?tab=t.0), on the second day of the event, the Galaxy Community in ELIXIR explored the prospects Galaxy brings as both a platform and a community. In short, the primary goal of this workshop was to promote knowledge about the wide range of accessible tools, procedures, and projects from closely related domains. This session was organized as a world cafe setup and divided into three major groups:  (a) [Research Data Management in Galaxy](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1cpT4iI5YxavfQ9gsCyCuZ69aL8jNVa8_QdjFrsXNGDc/edit?tab=t.0#heading=h.p0gzezzi3us4) moderated by Dr. Frederik Coppens and Dr. Rafael Andrade Buono (b) [Training and Skills](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1ScpWMWXF8JULMrPfAiMoIs1Ez4DykwzL2iYpRchGNvs/edit?tab=t.0#heading=h.da5gwyeoxhss) moderated by Dr. Bérénice Batut (c) [Galaxy Workflows and the IWC](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1cUhebg99EHICWD6KVhfGDthwZloW4BylZwokrFpPaq4/edit?tab=t.0#heading=h.da5gwyeoxhss) moderated by Dr. Wolfgang Maier.
