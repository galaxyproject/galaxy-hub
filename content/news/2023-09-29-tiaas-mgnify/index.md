The MGnify team of EMBL-EBI have used [TIaaS](https://usegalaxy.eu/tiaas/) to run the [MGnify Interactive Tool](https://usegalaxy.eu/?tool_id=interactive_tool_mgnify_notebook) on scale.
Sandy Rogers (Web Software Developer for MGnify) said:

"Course participants used Galaxy and the dedicated queue easily, without any assistance from the trainers – freeing them up to deliver the course material. The TIaaS Galaxy infrastructure is perfect for enabling us to take our training delivering off-site from EMBL-EBI, to meet our global userbase locally (in this case, in Bangkok). Live training courses also present unusual load requirements for our own hosted services, and so being able to spread the compute demand between fixed-availability resources and Galaxy is extremely helpful too."
