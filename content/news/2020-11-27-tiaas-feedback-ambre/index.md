The past 23-25 Nov, I run a 2-day Microbial Genomics workshop for 16 master students. It covered reads inspection to genome assembly, annotation and reads mapping.

Although this year was the first time that it went virtual, I have only positive feedback from this training, the jobs submitted were completed within few minutes and the possibility of sharing histories allowed the students with a poor internet connection to not waste time retrieving and uploading data.

Many thanks to the Galaxy Training Infrastructure as a Service, we could not live without it!
