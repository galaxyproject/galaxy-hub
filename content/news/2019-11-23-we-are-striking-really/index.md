November 29 will see the next global climate strike and this time The Freiburg
Galaxy Team is going to express its support more directly:

The team will be striking like last time but, in addition, **we will not
schedule new jobs on the European Galaxy server for the whole day**.

Running jobs will not be interrupted, but no new jobs will start to run. They will stay grey
for the entire day.

Again, we encourage all of you to join one of the huge number of strikes
[that will be taking place world-wide](https://fridaysforfuture.org/statistics/map?d=2019-11-29) on this day!

We will be striking in Freiburg, if you are nearby join us - and maybe we will find time
to talk about research as well :)
