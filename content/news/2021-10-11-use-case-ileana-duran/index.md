__Ileana Duran Fernandez__ from the [School of Medicine of the Technical University of Munich](https://www.ipt.med.tum.de/en) works on heart disease. Thank you Ileana and good luck with your project!

> Our project studies the effect of specific microRNAs inhibition as a treatment for heart disease. We evaluate transcriptome changes in cardiac cell types in different conditions, and for this we make use of useGalaxy.eu resources. Quality check, mapping, annotation and differential expression analysis are driven in useGalaxy.eu platform with its user-friendly environment, that makes the work fast and straightforward."
