From 7th to 9th of April 2025, Björn Grüning and Armin Dadras attended the [kick-off meeting of the EOSC Data Commons project](https://www.egi.eu/article/eosc-data-commons-kicks-off-to-boost-open-science-in-europe/), a [EU-funded initiative (Grant No. 101188179)](https://cordis.europa.eu/project/id/101188179) aimed at enhancing research data discovery, access, and reuse across Europe. As part of [the European Galaxy team](https://usegalaxy-eu.github.io/people), we are excited to contribute our expertise in scalable, user-friendly data analysis to this collaborative effort.

Key goals include:
- **AI-based Analytics-Oriented Metadata Warehouse and Discovery Service**
- **Federation of data repositories** enhanced with scientific applications and data analytics tools
- **Catalogue of data analytics tools** for seamless integration
- **Execution Service** enabling the deployment and execution of analytical tools
- **Metadata specifications** to ensure reproducibility and interoperability
- **FAIRness assessment and reproducibility tools**, along with related policies

The Galaxy team is involved in key work packages:

**WP5: Data Commons Preparation (Led by [SWITCH](https://www.switch.ch/en))**

We're contributing to:
- Developing harmonized APIs for tool and data registries
- Creating a federated Catalogue of tools
- Implementing specifications for processing requests
- Building applications to match datasets with suitable tools

**WP6: Data Analysis Orchestration and Deployment (Led by [CESNET](https://www.cesnet.cz/en))**

Our work includes:
- Supporting deployment of analysis packages across compute infrastructures
- Integrating established deployment mechanisms
- Developing abstraction layers for data access

These contributions leverage Galaxy's extensive experience in creating accessible, reproducible analysis platforms that serve diverse research communities.

Stay tuned for more details on how Galaxy supports open and collaborative research infrastructure!
