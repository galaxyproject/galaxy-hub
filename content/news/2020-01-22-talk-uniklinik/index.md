We were invited by [Dr. Achim Lother](https://www.herzzentrum.de/kliniken-fachbereiche/klinik-fuer-kardiologie-und-angiologie-i/grundlagenforschung/cardiovascular-pharmacology.html) (AG Cardiovascular Pharmacology, Uniklinik Freiburg) and [Prof. Christoph Bode](https://www.med.uni-freiburg.de/de/fakultaet/profs/bode) for a talk about introducing Galaxy and RNAseq data analysis to researchers of the Uniklinik Freiburg. Anika presented Galaxy as a framework to allow researchers without any programming or informatics skills to perform their own data analysis. 30 scientists and researchers attended the talk, picked flyers and got information about upcoming Galaxy workshops. We are happy to support our local Freiburg community!
