As part of the [Master's program in R&D in Biotechnology and Biomedicine at the University of
Valencia (Spain)](https://www.uv.es/uvweb/college/en/postgraduate-courses/official-master-s-degrees/official-master-s-degrees-offered/master-s-degree-research-development-biotechnology-biomedicine-1285848941532/Titulacio.html?id=1285956361839), I ([Miguel Morard](https://scholar.google.es/citations?user=_j3v1hMAAAAJ&hl=en)) teach a practical course on [Bioinformatic techniques](https://www.uv.es/uvweb/undergraduate-degree-human-nutrition-dietetics/en/after-degree/official-master-s-degree/uv-master-s-degrees-catalogue-1285933577299.html?idA=44696&idT=2224;2025), with a strong focus on
genomics. The course runs for one month, with two-hour sessions held twice a week. It brings together
approximately 35 students from diverse Life Sciences backgrounds, including Biology, Biotechnology,
and Biochemistry.

To support these hands-on sessions, I rely on the [Galaxy Europe](https://usegalaxy.eu/) [Training Infrastructure as a Service (TIaaS)](https://usegalaxy.eu/tiaas/). This platform provides the computing resources needed to carry out demanding bioinformatics
analyses in a limited amount of time—something that would be very difficult to achieve otherwise.

Galaxy’s intuitive interface allows students with no programming or Linux background to access and
run sophisticated Genomics [workflows](https://usegalaxy.org/workflows/list_published). This accessibility is key for our students, many of whom will
go on to work in roles where they must interpret genomic data, even if they aren’t directly performing
the analyses themselves.

The course focuses on three core topics: Genome _de novo_ assembly, Genome annotation and Genome
resequencing.

We begin with the [Galaxy introduction tutorial](https://training.galaxyproject.org/training-material/topics/introduction/tutorials/galaxy-intro-101/tutorial.html), giving students the foundational knowledge they need
to navigate the platform. From there, they perform [_de novo_ genome assemblies](https://training.galaxyproject.org/training-material/topics/assembly/), experimenting with
different parameters to observe how these influence the final results. This comparative analysis gives
students valuable insights into data quality and the impact of analytical decisions.

Following assembly, we move on to [genome annotation](https://training.galaxyproject.org/training-material/topics/genome-annotation/). Here, students assess the completeness of their
assemblies and learn about the challenges of gene identification. We emphasize the risks of poor
annotation and how it can mislead downstream research.

Finally, we explore genome resequencing, where the importance of choosing a suitable reference
genome becomes clear. Through this, students develop a deeper understanding of potential pitfalls in
comparative analyses.

Working in pairs or small groups, students are encouraged to discuss their results, troubleshoot
together, and reflect on the biological meaning behind the outputs. By engaging directly with real data
and observing the consequences of different analysis choices, they become more critical users of
bioinformatics tools and more cautious consumers of database information.

One of the main goals of these sessions is to prepare students not use complex bioinformatics tools, but
to think critically about the data they’ll encounter in their future careers. Being able to interpret and
evaluate results—even without deep computational skills—is a valuable competency for any life
science researcher.

The enthusiasm of the students is evident—they consistently request more practical sessions and deeply
appreciate the opportunity to apply theoretical knowledge to real-world problems.

None of this would be possible without the support of [the European Galaxy team](https://usegalaxy-eu.github.io/people) and the [TIaaS service](https://usegalaxy.eu/tiaas/).
Their contribution is essential to making hands-on genomics education accessible and effective. A
sincere thank to them for helping us train the next generation of biotechnology and biomedical
professionals.
