Gel Electrophoresis is a staple of molecular biology, providing a way to separate DNA, RNA, or proteins by size and charge. While gels are usually interpreted visually, the ability to quantify band intensities offers much richer insightsâ€”allowing researchers to estimate product yields, verify PCR amplification, or assess protein purity.
