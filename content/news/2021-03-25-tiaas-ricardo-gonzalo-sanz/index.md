Recently, staff from the Statistics and Bioinformatics Unit from Vall dâ€™Hebron Institute of Research (VHIR) were involved in two trainings where we used TIaaS resources. We never used TiaaS before these trainings.

From 16 November to 16 December 2020, the Bioinformatics Course for Biomedical Research was taught to 25 students. This course provides students with the knowledge to understand common workflows in omics data analysis and to be familiar with common bioinformatics tools. Some of the lessons taught include an introduction to the Galaxy Platform, Quality control of NGS data, RNAseq and Variant data analysis. Some of the lessons were focused on the tutorials found in the [Galaxy Training Network (GTN)](https://training.galaxyproject.org/training-material/). 

From 23 to 25 February 2021, Bioinformatics lessons within the study plan of the Master in Translational Biomedical Research were taught to more than 50 students. This master is an official programme that gives access to doctoral studies and it has been designed in order to create excellent translational researchers able to contribute to the transformation of knowledge from basic research into clinical applications that provide a benefit to the patient's health. Some of the lessons taught include an introduction to the Galaxy Platform, RNAseq and Variant data analysis, focused again in the tutorials found in the GTN among others.

After using Training Infrastructure as a Service resources in both trainings, we can say that the effect on the dynamics and performance for the sessions where the resources were used was extremely positive. Compared to previous editions, TiaaS allowed us to achieve more, faster and in a more convenient way (special mention here for the queue monitoring page, super useful for the trainers), and the improvement on the overall satisfaction for both trainers and students was clear regarding Galaxy usage. Therefore, the resources made a significant contribution to conduct the trainings in a more fluid and effective way. In addition, the process for requesting the resources was straightforward, the resources allocated were accurate for our needs,  and the people from UseGalaxy.eu were always quick and efficient at providing instructions, follow-up and assistance when needed (many thanks in particular to Beatriz Serrano-Solano).

All in all, highly recommended. Thanks for making this service available!
