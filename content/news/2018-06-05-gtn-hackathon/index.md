The Monday was dedicated to a Train the Trainer workshop by Sarah Morgan from EBI. We reviewed learning principles and how they apply to training and learned training techniques that can be used to enhance learner engagement and participation. 

On Tuesday, we started with an update on Galaxy features relevant for training. After for the next 2 days, we broke into groups to work on several aspects of the Galaxy training material:
