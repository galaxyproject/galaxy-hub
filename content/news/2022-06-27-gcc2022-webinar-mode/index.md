As you may know, the [Galaxy Community Conference (GCC2022)](/events/gcc2022/) will take place in Minnesota this year. For those that won't attend in person, the GCC Organizing Committee is happy to announce a **virtual webinar-like option**.


**How can you register?**

* There is a special *Virtual* option in the registration form for online only.
* Once you are registered and a few days before the conference, you'll receive all the information you need, including:
   - an invitation to join the GCC2022 Slack space,
   - a link to a zoom webinar.


**Is it going to be interactive?**

There will be a [Meeting Owl](https://owllabs.com) on-site that will show you the room. In the webinar mode, you will have the chance to:
* Watch the presentations live (remember the time difference!).
* Ask questions. The chat and Q`&`A functionality will be enabled. There will be someone online in close contact with the moderator in the room.
* If there's no time for more questions, you can always post them in the Slack channel.


**Will you be able to attend the poster session?**

Partially. The authors will deposit their posters in [Sched](https://gcc2022.sched.com/), and you'll have the chance to ask questions in Slack using the channel *gcc2022-posters-demo*. Their response may be slow, depending on how busy the poster presenters are in real life.


**How much will the virtual attendance cost?**

- Regular online registration: $80.
- $10 for Low-Income-Countries (check [this list](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1PW11lByYd61cIT7wPnGmTQpd9kM79EXX/view?usp=sharing) to find out which countries qualify as such). 


**When is the deadline for registration?**

 - July 15.

Thank you all for all the interest that you've been showing to join GCC2022, regardless of the format. That's great to see!
