## Keynote Speakers

GCC2023 hosted three keynote speakers that presented their thoughts and research results on the topics of wildlife conservation, structural biology, and biosecurity. The presenters showcased how their teams were able to accomplish their work in a more accessible and reproducible manner via the adoption of Galaxy. 

Each of the three keynote speakers presented aspirational and informational talks discussing advancement in their prospective research areas, focusing on open-access end-to-end bioinformatics. Galaxy played a strong role in each of the keynote speakers' recent research advances, and Galaxy developers and the Galaxy community were able to see firsthand the impact Galaxy has on the scientific community. Additionally, each keynote speaker provided inspiration for the future of Galaxy and was given time to speak directly with the developers behind the trajectory of the platform. 

### Carolyn Hogg, PhD (University of Sydney)
Dr. Carolyn Hogg, from the University of Sydney, kicked off GCC2023 as the first keynote speaker. Dr. Hogg has been instrumental in the research being conducted by the Save the Tasmanian Devil Program, in addition to research focusing on other Australian species, such as orange-bellied parrots, koalas, bilbies, and woylies. Her GCC2023 talk, titled “To Infinity and Beyond: Combining genomics and cloud technology to save our species”, highlighted the need for collaborative research between conservationists and genomic scientists. Her vision to create a conservation legacy for Australia by changing the way science, management, and policy are integrated is enhanced through the use of Galaxy. By using an open-sourced platform like Galaxy, Dr. Hogg is able to produce reproducible genomic science to aid in species conservation and management practices in Australia.

## Training Sessions

![GCC2023 Meeting Report Image7](65B75F71-AA51-4793-AC44-F7BAEE2D2B24_1_105_c.jpeg)

Training is a key priority for the Galaxy Community. Making it easy for researchers to learn to use the platform, how to perform a new analysis, or explore features and tools that can solve real needs researchers face has been instrumental for the growth and sustainability of Galaxy. In that spirit, throughout three days of GCC2023, a total of 15 different training sessions were held for attendees to learn and practice hands-on bioinformatics with experts. Experts included principal investigators, Galaxy developers, project managers, and power users of Galaxy. Training session topics varied, providing relevant and practical learning opportunities to all of GCC2023’s attendees. From microbiology and human genetics to workflow and tool development, GCC2023 training sessions offered opportunities to expand attendees' particular research interests and encounter new topics. 

Each session was nearly three hours long, providing time for trainees to immerse themselves in the material fully, connect with their trainer and fellow trainees, and exchange experiences and methods with people from different backgrounds. 

## Birds of a Feather (BoF)

Birds of a Feather, or BoF, sessions are informal gatherings during GCC that allow participants to discuss topics of interest. BoFs took place at the close of the conference each day, and groups split up into focus groups to network and discuss with experts and fellow attendees. 

During GCC2023, there were nine different opportunities for attendees to participate in BoFs. A variety of topics were presented through this year's BoFs, including the much-anticipated opportunity for power users of Galaxy to converse with developers. Additionally, BoFs gave the opportunity for mini social events, such as board games, pub crawls, and a walking tour of Brisbane, Australia! 

## CoFest

Following the main conference of GCC2023, Collaboration Fest (CoFest) took place for three days. CoFest is a community gathering by Galaxy members who are interested in contributing to Galaxy's tool set, documentation, training materials, code base, and anywhere else that expands the Galaxy ecosystem. The goals of CoFest are to:

1. Expand the contributor community. This CoFest is, first and foremost, about welcoming new contributors and helping you learn the resources and meet the people that will help you contribute.
2. Expand the Galaxy Ecosystem. Not just the code but the whole ecosystem. That includes training, tools, best practice workflows, documentation, test cases, translations, infrastructure, and even code.

CoFest participants coalesced around shared interests and addressed common topics related to those interests. These clusters formed before, at the beginning of, and throughout CoFest, and aimed to be fluid and highly interactive with each other. This year's CoFest was divided into nine broad topics: frontend, backend, community, design, tools, workflows, training, testing, and side projects. Because CoFest is ever-changing and builds throughout the event, topics were broken down further to focus on topics such as interactive tools; upgrading Vue3 and upload features; engaging and retaining community participation in activities, governance, and leadership; ChatGXY; implementing a Galaxy tool health auditing service; and Simon’s Data Club.

## Social Events
GCC2023 aspires to connect members of the Galaxy community and therefore held different opportunities for social events throughout the conference. This year’s GCC2023 social events included a welcome dinner to kick off the conference, a walking tour of Brisbane hosted by a Galaxy member local to the community, a pub crawl with arcade games, a night of board games, a conference dinner, and the highly proclaimed visit to Lone Pine Koala Sanctuary! 

The Lone Pine Koala Sanctuary was, without a doubt, the highlight of this year’s social events! A large group of GCC2023 attendees visited the world’s largest koala sanctuary for an afternoon of animal encounters, wildlife shows, and learning about some of Australia’s most beloved wildlife!
