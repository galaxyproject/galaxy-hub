[Open Life Science (OLS)](https://openlifesci.org/) is an **online mentoring & training program** to help **individuals and stakeholders in research** to become **Open Science ambassadors**.

It is a **16-week long personal mentorship and cohort-based training**, where participants (organisers, hosts, mentors and project leads/mentees) of this program:

- **share** their expertise and gain knowledge essential to create, lead, and sustain an Open Science project
- **connect** with members across different projects, communities, backgrounds, and identities
- **empower** each other to become effective Open Science ambassadors in their communities

After the success of the [1st cohort](https://openlifesci.org/ols-1), a 2nd cohort is starting now with [33 diverse projects](https://openlifesci.org/ols-2/projects-participants/#projects) leaded by [51 participants](https://openlifesci.org/ols-2/projects-participants/#participants), mentored by [35 mentors](https://openlifesci.org/ols-2#mentors) and supported by [65 experts](https://openlifesci.org/ols-2#experts).

The Freiburg Galaxy Team is participating to this 2nd cohort with Beatriz's project to [grow the Galaxy Community](https://openlifesci.org/ols-2/projects-participants/#growing-the-galaxy-community). Bérénice, one of the co-founder, is also [organizing](https://openlifesci.org/about#organizers) OLS. Together with Björn, they will give talks and share their experience and expertise with participants, as [experts](https://openlifesci.org/about#experts).
