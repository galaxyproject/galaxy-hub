This newsletter coincides with the [anniversary of James Taylor's death](#featured-news) on April 2, 2020.  James was a Galaxy Project founder and PI, and losing him at the same time as the global COVID-19 shutdown made for a tough month, and then a tough year for the Galaxy Community.  To mark this, there are two items about James below.  First, *a call to share your favorite story about James* via a 30 second video (by April 30).  Second, there is a link to *a note to James* written by project leadership (mainly Anton).

The other big news is that [registration, abstract submission, and fellowship applications for the 2021 Galaxy Community Conference are now open](#community-news).  Abstracts and fellowship applications are due by May 7.

And as always there are sections on

* **[upcoming events](#event-news)**,
* news about **[public Galaxy platforms](#galaxy-platforms-news)**,
* recent **[blog posts](#galactic-blog-activity)**,
* **[training and doc updates](#doc-hub-and-training-updates)**,
* recent **[open-access Galaxy-related publications](#publications)**, and
* **[new releases](#releases).**

It's been a memorable twelve months.  It would have been easy to curl up and hide, but we kept going, addressed gaps, and helped address the global pandemic as well.

Thanks for supporting each other,

Dave Clements and Beatriz Serrano-Solano, Editors

<div class="card-header">Share your favorite James Taylor story</div>

It's been a year since [James Taylor](/jxtx/) passed away.  To remember him, and mark his upcoming birthday (May 18) we would like to create a community video. We are asking you to tell us your favorite story about James in ~ 30 seconds. We will combine your clips into a video that will be prominently featured on all Galaxy-related sites.

Here is what we will need you to do before April 30:

1. Think of your favorite story/interaction/event involving James
2. Pick a nice location and record the video!
3. The video should be:

* in a high-resolution
* without background noise
* in a horizontal orientation (not vertical!)
* ≲ 30 seconds in length

4. Deposit video file to your Google Drive or Dropbox folder (or any other location that would allow us to retrieve it)
5. Send a link to the video, your name and location as you would like them to appear in the final video to: outreach@galaxyproject.org

Thank you all in advance and please feel free to invite other friends of James to participate.

The project leadership marked the one year anniversary of James's passing with [a letter to him](/jxtx/) summarizing the year he missed.  It starts with

  "What a year. It was difficult."

and then goes on to describe the community's progress and perseverance over the year.  It's a powerful reflection on James, this community, and the past year.  Please take a look.

[GCC2021 Update](https://www.vibconferences.be/events/gcc2021)

</div>

**The [2021 Galaxy Community Conference](https://www.vibconferences.be/events/gcc2021) will be held 28 June through July 10.  It will be [virtual, affordable, and globally accessible](/news/2021-02-gcc-virtual/).**

GCC2021 will start on 28 June with a [__week of online training__](https://galaxyproject.org/events/gcc2021/training/). Training will largely use the GTN Smörgåsbord model: lectures will be prerecorded, with live help available on chat for the duration of the week.  This model allows participants to learn at their own pace, avoids scheduling conflicts that are inherent with our usual multi-track training, and enables those with low bandwidth internet connections to fully participate.

We will reuse the BCC2020 model for talks, posters, and demos: __posters and demos__ will be live (sometimes in both hemispheres), and __talks__ will be prerecorded.

**And [GCC2021 is looking for sponsors](http://bit.ly/gcc2021_prospectus_v1) too!**

__June 25__

GCC2021 registration is open until June 25.

Registering before __May 24__ saves 50% off of the full rates. Registration discounts will be available to researchers from low and lower-middle income countries. For everyone else, registration are downright cheap too: the rates start in €15.00 for the training week and in €25.00 for the 3-day conference. The CoFest is free.

__May 7__

The Galaxy Community Fund is offering fellowships to students, post-docs, and other non-profit / academic / government researchers based in lower, lower-middle and upper-middle income countries who will benefit from attending GCC2021, and for whom the cost of registration is a barrier.

It will cover the full registration for any GCC2021 events. [Apply here](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSfyqKg87x8wL1EhOfrGR0SlQui8wEkQgg3qVFi6txO6GmHgKg/viewform).

</div>

**Submissions due May 6**

[ISMB/ECCB 2021](https://www.iscb.org/ismbeccb2021) is one of the largest bioinformatics conferences and every year Galaxy has had a significant presence.  ISMB/ECCB is built from community building blocks, and this year that includes the **[Bioinformatics Open Source Conference (BOSC)](https://www.open-bio.org/events/bosc-2021/)** (our 2018 and 2020 conference partner), as well as communities focused on [high-throughput sequencing](http://hitseq.org/), [mass spec](http://cosi.iscb.org/wiki/CompMS:Home), [bioinformatics education](http://cosi.iscb.org/wiki/Education:Home), [visualization](http://biovis.net/2021/index.html), [microbiomes](https://www.microbiome-cosi.org/), [bioinformatics core facilities](http://bioinfo-core.org/index.php/ISMB_2021:_BioinfoCoreWorkshop), and [many others](https://www.iscb.org/communities-of-special-interest).

**[BOSC](https://www.open-bio.org/2021/03/24/join-us-at-bosc-2021/)** is a particularly good match for the Galaxy community. Topics include software development practices that promote open science standards and sharing of biological data and code, as well as approaches for building diverse communities.

Most of these are accepting talk and poster submissions through the [ISMB/ECCB website](https://www.iscb.org/ismbeccb2021), but [BioInfo-Core is taking talk submissions here](https://forms.gle/N1mfB3dEEd4oi4wBA).  All submissions are due May 6.

Brassinosteroids are phytohormones that have the ability to stimulate plant growth and confer resistance against abiotic and biotic stresses.
This tutorial details the necessary steps to identify potential targets of brassinosteroid-induced miRNAs.

# Publications

Pub curation activities [are on a semi-hiatus right now](/news/2020-08-10k-pubs/#the-future) but a few publications referencing, using, extending, and implementing Galaxy were added to the [Galaxy Publication Library](https://www.zotero.org/groups/galaxy) anyway.  Here are the new open access *Galactic* and *Stellar* pubs:
