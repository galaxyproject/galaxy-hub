[TÜV SÜD](https://www.tuvsud.com) has awarded the University's data centre the international certification for information security management systems ([ISMS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Information_security_management)) [ISO/IEC 27001](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO/IEC_27001).

This certifies an IT environment that meets security objectives of confidentiality, integrity and availability of research data - and its the environment in which
the European Galaxy server is hosted 😀

The certification was initiated and funded by the German Network for Bioinformatics Infrastructure (de.NBI) 3 years ago. It's a long process in which many
people from the entire University have been involved to improve the information security management of the entire University. We would like to thank
especially Jan Leendertse, Dirk von Suchodoletz, Marc Herbstritt and the entire "Steuerkreis" 😀 We made it!
