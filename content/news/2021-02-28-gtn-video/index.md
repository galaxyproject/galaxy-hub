Geert Bonamie from [VIB Bioinformatics Core](https://www.bits.vib.be/), and part of [ELIXIR Belgium](https://www.elixir-belgium.org/), has created a fancy video introducing the [Galaxy Training Network (GTN)](https://training.galaxyproject.org/).

This formidable video takes us on a journey through the different learning profiles covered in the GTN, the structure that the tutorials follow, the accessibility of all the training material directly from Galaxy, the contributions from the community, and the periodic community CoFests. Please feel free to share it!
