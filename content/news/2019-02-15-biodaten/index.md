We are really proud to announce that we, as part of de.NBI and with the European Galaxy Server, are part of [Bioinformatics DATa EnviroNment](http://www.biodaten.info/?page=about) (BioDATEN) now!

The bioinformatics centers of the German universities Freiburg, Tübingen, Heidelberg, and the DKFZ and EMBL will join forces and build a Science Data Center. Handling huge amounts of data necessitates the implementation of workflows between a storage and analysis system and the collaboration in national and international networks such as ELIXIR and Galaxy.
