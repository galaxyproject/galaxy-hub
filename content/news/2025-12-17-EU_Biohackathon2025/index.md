## Evolving FAIR Image Analysis in Galaxy for Cross-domain & AI-ready Applications

At this year’s **BioHackathon Europe**, Project 9 brought together a multidisciplinary, cross-RI team to advance FAIR image analysis in Galaxy, focusing on interoperability, reusability, and AI‑readiness. The project connected members of Euro‑BioImaging, ELIXIR, and beyond.

## Why this project?

Image analysis is still fragmented between domains, infrastructures, repositories, and tools. Our goal? Simple but ambitious:  
Make image analysis more **interoperable, reusable, and scalable in Galaxy**, while staying **FAIR** from data to results.

## What we achieved

Concrete results from the hackathon:

- **BioImage Archive → Galaxy integration**
  - Added *BioStudies upload* support
  - Improved *BIA retrieval* tooling
- **ISCC support in Galaxy**
  - ISCC hash generator
  - Tools for hash verification and comparison in the making
- **Metadata & standards**
  - Extended **GeoJSON** support
  - Advanced **EDAM Bioimaging** maturity
    - Tool and tutorial annotation
    - Domain-specific term enrichment

Together, these improvements strengthen provenance, traceability, and FAIRness across Galaxy image analysis workflows.

## Work in progress (WIP)

Key efforts still evolving:

- **OMERO → Galaxy** integration for seamless image import  
- **ISCC tutorial** to support adoption and good practices  
- **Galaxy Imaging Lab** setup  
- **"Where to start" tutorial** for new users  
- **Community paper**
  - Authorship coordination
  - Outline and roadmap underway

➡️ Follow our progress on the [project board](https://github.com/orgs/FAIR-imaging/projects/4)

## What’s next

We’re aiming to:

- Write a report
- Finalize and stabilize all WIPs  
- Deliver **ready-to-use workflows** for image analysis in Galaxy  
- Publish a community paper including tutorials and training materials  
- Keep building an open, collaborative imaging community that makes image data science **FAIR**!

## Get involved

Whether you're into Galaxy or any kind of imaging, your input is welcome. We’re always looking for feedback, tool testers, tutorial contributors, and creative ideas.

If you're **passionate about open science and FAIR imaging**, join us, we're building this together.

### Communication Channels

Join our [Matrix channel](https://matrix.to/#/#galaxyproject_imaging:matrix.org) for live discussions and updates.

### Community Meetings

We meet monthly via the **Euro-BioImaging Expert Group** on “FAIR Image Data Workflows”, chaired by Anne Fouilloux and Beatriz Serrano-Solano.

- **When**: 3rd Wednesday of each month at 16:00 CET  
- **Duration**: ~1 hour  
- **Agenda**: Community updates, short talks, planning for grants/papers/events  
- [Meeting notes & open agenda](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1eWyj5IJVW4qeLKcz2SybHbf0Kx6K3Njvirl6ql-f1Fo/edit?tab=t.0#heading=h.wvq01nlj8eqb)

### In-person Meetings

We’re active in conferences and hackathons—including the BioHackathons 2023 and 2024—where we shared new developments and collaborative outputs, like this [preprint](https://osf.io/preprints/biohackrxiv/w8dsz) and community poster.

## 🙌 Meet the dream team of Project 9 @ BioHackathon Europe 2025

🎉 Hats off to **Leonid Kostrykin**, **Beatriz Serrano‑Solano**, **Pavan Videm**, **David Lopez**, **Maarten Paul**, and **Martin Etzrodt!**
