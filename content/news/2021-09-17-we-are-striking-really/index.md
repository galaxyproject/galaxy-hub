September the 24th will see the next global climate strike! 
As last time, the Freiburg Galaxy Team is going to express its support more directly:

The team will be striking and **we will not schedule new jobs on the European Galaxy server for the whole day**.

Running jobs will not be interrupted, but no new jobs will start to run. They will stay grey
for the entire day.

Again, we encourage all of you to join one of the huge number of strikes
[that will be taking place world-wide](https://fridaysforfuture.org/september24/) on this day!

We will be striking in Freiburg, if you are nearby join us - and maybe we will find time
to talk about research as well :)
