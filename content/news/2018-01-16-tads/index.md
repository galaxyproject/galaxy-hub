## Abstract

Despite an abundance of new studies about topologically associating domains (TADs), the
role of genetic information in TAD formation is still not fully understood. Here we use our
software, HiCExplorer (https://hicexplorer.readthedocs.io) to annotate >2800 high-resolution (570
bp) TAD boundaries in Drosophila melanogaster. We identify eight DNA motifs enriched at
boundaries, including a motif bound by the M1BP protein, and two new boundary motifs. In
contrast to mammals, the CTCF motif is only enriched on a small fraction of boundaries
flanking inactive chromatin while most active boundaries contain the motifs bound by the
M1BP or Beaf-32 proteins. We demonstrate that boundaries can be accurately predicted
using only the motif sequences at open chromatin sites. We propose that DNA sequence
guides the genome architecture by allocation of boundary proteins in the genome. Finally, we
present an interactive online database to access and explore the spatial organization of fly,
mouse and human genomes, available at [chorogenome.ie-freiburg.mpg.de](http://chorogenome.ie-freiburg.mpg.de).
