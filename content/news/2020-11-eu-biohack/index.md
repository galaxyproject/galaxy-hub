Last week we had the [__BioHackathon Europe 2020__](https://www.biohackathon-europe.org/) - online for the first time and with participants from all over the world and the Galaxy community has participated in several [projects](https://www.biohackathon-europe.org/projects.html):


### [CNV detection software containerisation and benchmark](https://github.com/elixir-europe/BioHackathon-projects-2020/tree/master/projects/7)

After an analysis and selection of the relevant tools that could be integrated into Galaxy, [LUMPY](https://github.com/galaxyproject/tools-iuc/pull/3287), a tool for CNV detection was integrated and 5 containers created. On the data side, the [GIAB dataset](https://jimb.stanford.edu/giab-resources) was included as a Data Library in Galaxy. This was just the starting point, as there are plans to add more tools (like [manta](https://github.com/Illumina/manta)) and training materials to the GTN too.


### [EDAM and Tool Information Profiles](https://github.com/elixir-europe/BioHackathon-projects-2020/tree/master/projects/10)

This project was focused on the discussion with different communities and two new collaborations were estabished.


### [Exporting rich metadata and provenance from Galaxy using RO-Crate packaging](https://github.com/elixir-europe/BioHackathon-projects-2020/tree/master/projects/14)

In this project, some improvements on the RO-Crate-py [(Pull Request)](https://github.com/ResearchObject/ro-crate-py/pull/37) and gxformat2 libraries were made [(Pull Request)](https://github.com/galaxyproject/gxformat2/pull/50). In addition, two versions of ro-crate-py were released: [0.2.2](https://github.com/ResearchObject/ro-crate-py/releases/tag/0.2.2) and [0.2.3](https://github.com/ResearchObject/ro-crate-py/releases/tag/0.2.3).

### [Improve the support of Common Workflow Language in Galaxy](https://github.com/elixir-europe/BioHackathon-projects-2020/tree/master/projects/17)

[Several pull requests](https://github.com/common-workflow-language/galaxy/pulls?q=is%3Apr+is%3Aclosed) were merged with the aim of getting a better support of CWL in Galaxy.


### [Hardening and Testing Galaxy cluster support with BioContainer](https://github.com/elixir-europe/BioHackathon-projects-2020/tree/master/projects/18)

This project aimed at testing the Galaxy cluster support through Galaxy runners. The project team spent most of the week working on the Chronos runner to revamp it and integrate the Chronos infrastructure into the docker-galaxy project. In that direction, several [fixes](https://github.com/Laniakea-elixir-it/laniakea/issues/25), [pull request](https://github.com/bgruening/docker-galaxy-stable/pull/574), and [issues](https://github.com/galaxyproject/galaxy/issues/10677) were identified.


### [An interface between Galaxy and disease maps](https://github.com/elixir-europe/BioHackathon-projects-2020/tree/master/projects/27)

All the information related to this project can be found in [this repository](https://github.com/elixir-luxembourg/BH2020-galaxy-dpmaps).


### [Deploying biocontainers in orchestration environments for life science research](https://github.com/elixir-europe/BioHackathon-projects-2020/tree/master/projects/31)


### [bio.tools integration and sustainable development](https://github.com/elixir-europe/BioHackathon-projects-2020/blob/8f588223a2ca50ecb76cdf37fa5bfc21aa54e5d4/projects/11)

Mutual metadata exchange among different bio.tools registries is the ultimate goal of this project. While a lot has been achieved, the development is still ongoing and will be continued. The corresponding GitHub repo: https://github.com/bio-tools/content
