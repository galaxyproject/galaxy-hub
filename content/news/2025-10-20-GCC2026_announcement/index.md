# GCC2026: The Galaxy Community is Heading to Clermont-Ferrand, France\!

Join us **June 22–24, 2026, in Clermont-Ferrand, France,** followed by **CoFest from June 25–26**, for the flagship event of the Galaxy year.

Hosted by Université Clermont Auvergne (UCA), GCC2026 will bring together researchers, developers, and educators from across the global Galaxy community to share discoveries, build skills, and shape the future of open data science.

## What to expect

GCC is more than a conference, it’s a celebration of collaboration, innovation, and open science.

Attendees can look forward to:

* **Talks, posters, and workshops** highlighting the latest Galaxy tools, methods, and use cases.  
* **Training sessions** designed to help newcomers and experts alike expand their analysis skills.  
* **Community networking and collaboration** opportunities with Galaxy teams from around the world.  
* CoFest, where participants team up to **build, document, and improve** the Galaxy ecosystem.

Whether you’re a data scientist, biologist, software developer, or educator, GCC2026 is your chance to connect with a global network of people passionate about making research more accessible, transparent, and reproducible.

## Why Clermont-Ferrand?

Nestled in the heart of the Auvergne volcanic region, Clermont-Ferrand offers a breathtaking backdrop for science and collaboration. Expect dramatic landscapes, a striking black lava-stone cathedral, and vibrant streets filled with cafés, history, and the energy of a thriving university city.

You’ll be surrounded by the Chaîne des Puys, a UNESCO World Heritage site of ancient volcanoes, a fitting setting for sparking new ideas and igniting innovation.
