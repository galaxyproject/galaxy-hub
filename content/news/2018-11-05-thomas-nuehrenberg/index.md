## Abstract

**Background:** Diabetes mellitus (DM) has been associated with increased platelet reactivity as well
as increased levels of platelet RNAs in plasma. Here, we sought to evaluate whether the platelet
transcriptome is altered in the presence of uncontrolled DM. Methods. Next-generation sequencing
(NGS) was performed on platelet RNA for 5 patients with uncontrolled DM (HbA1c 9.0%) and 5 control
patients (HbA1c 5.5%) with otherwise similar clinical characteristics. RNA was isolated from
leucocyte-depleted platelet-rich plasma. Libraries of platelet RNAs were created separately
for long RNAs after ribosomal depletion and for small RNAs from total RNA, followed by
next-generation sequencing.

**Results:** Platelets in both groups demonstrated RNA expression
profiles characterized by absence of leukocyte-specific transcripts, high expression of
well-known platelet transcripts, and in total 6,343 consistently detectable transcripts.
Extensive statistical bioinformatic analysis yielded 12 genes with consistently differential
expression at a lenient FDR < 0.1, thereof 8 protein-coding genes and 2 genes with known
expression in platelets (MACF1 and ITGB3BP). Three of the four differentially expressed
noncoding genes were YRNAs (RNY1, RNY3, and RNY4) which were all downregulated in DM.
23 miRNAs were differentially expressed between the two groups.
Of the 13 miRNAs with decreased expression in the diabetic group,
8 belonged to the DLK1–DIO3 gene region on chromosome 14q32.2.

**Conclusions:** In this study, uncontrolled DM had a remote impact on different components of the platelet transcriptome.
Increased expression of MACF1, together with supporting predicted mRNA-miRNA interactions as well as
reduced expression of RNYs in platelets, may reflect subclinical platelet activation in uncontrolled DM.
