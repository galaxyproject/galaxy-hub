# üéâ W4E2025 Workshop Review ‚Äì Empowering Metabolomics Researchers with W4M

The **Workflow4Experimenters (W4E2025)** workshop successfully took place in **April and May 2025**, bringing together a vibrant international community of scientists passionate about **LC-MS**, **GC-MS**, and **NMR** data analysis. Hosted in **Rouen, France**, with preliminary webinars conducted online, this hybrid-format event helped researchers unlock the full potential of the **Workflow4Metabolomics (W4M)** platform via the Galaxy interface.

## üìö Workshop Format Recap

This year‚Äôs edition introduced a redesigned format to help participants better prepare and take full advantage of their on-site time.

### üñ•Ô∏è April 28‚Äì30, 2025: Online Theoretical Webinars

Over the course of three days, participants attended a series of online webinars that introduced them to:

- The **Galaxy platform** and its role in metabolomics analysis.
- Core tools in the **W4M infrastructure**, including preprocessing, normalization, and statistical modules.
- Practical guidance on preparing datasets for analysis.
- Walkthroughs of real-case scenarios using public data.

These sessions offered a deep dive into theoretical foundations and essential workflow strategies, allowing participants to familiarize themselves with the environment before the in-person training. Attendees were also encouraged to complete optional exercises in advance to reinforce learning and prepare their own datasets.

### üßë‚Äçüè´ May 12‚Äì16, 2025: In-Person Training in Rouen

Hosted at the **PBS Laboratory in Rouen**, the on-site training week focused on the application of theory to participants' own data. Each day was structured around:

- **Small-group tutoring sessions**, where attendees received personalized support from experienced instructors.
- Hands-on use of the **W4M workflows** for data processing, multivariate statistics, and molecular annotation.
- Peer discussions and troubleshooting in a collaborative, supportive setting.
- Opportunities to ask specific questions relevant to each participant‚Äôs research.

The in-person week also featured **three invited talks**:

- **H√©l√®ne Lavanant** (COBRA, Univ Rouen, France): *Ultra-High Resolution Mass Spectrometry in Metabolomics*
- **Isabelle Schmitz** (PBS, CNRS Rouen, France): *Advanced Analytical Strategies for Molecular Profiling*¬®
- **T√©o Hebra** (IOCB, Prague, Czech Republic): *Molecular networking*

These talks provided additional insights into cutting-edge research and applications in metabolomics, enriching the learning experience.

## üó£ Survey Feedback Snapshot

Participants overwhelmingly expressed strong satisfaction with W4E2025. Most reported that the workshop fully met their expectations, particularly appreciating the quality of the tutoring sessions and the supportive, knowledgeable team of instructors. The Galaxy initiation and data processing sessions were especially well-received, while several attendees suggested that more time and depth could be dedicated to annotation and molecular network analysis in future editions.

The hybrid format‚Äîwebinars followed by on-site tutoring‚Äîwas seen as effective, with many valuing the ability to work on their own datasets. Several participants also recommended improvements for future workshops, including more hands-on tips, clearer workflow diagrams, extended Q&A time after webinars, and the option for more structured follow-up support.

Overall, the feedback highlighted a successful and well-organized event, with thoughtful suggestions to make future editions even more impactful and tailored to participants‚Äô needs.
