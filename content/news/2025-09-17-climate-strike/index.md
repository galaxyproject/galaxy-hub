# Climate Crisis does not wait for your jobs to finish!
Climate strikes are going to take place across Germany this **Saturday, September 20th, 2025**! As last time, the Freiburg Galaxy Team is going to express its support more directly: the team will be striking in [Freiburg](https://freiburgforfuture.de/), if you are nearby join us!
To raise additional awareness in the scientific community, we decided to pause the job queue for a few hours on Saturday.
This means that you can still visit our website, put jobs into our queue, but the server will not start new jobs. Running jobs will not be affected.
