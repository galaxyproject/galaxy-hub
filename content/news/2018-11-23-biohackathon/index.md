ELIXIR France with the support of the ELIXIR Hub and the ELIXIR interoperability platform and in collaboration with COST CHARME, the National Bioscience Database Center (NBDC) and the Database Center for Life Science (DBCLS), organized last week (November 12th - 16th, 2018) a [BioHackathon](https://bh2018paris.info/index.html) in Paris. Bérénice, Helena, Björn, and Saskia were there and represented the Galaxy Freiburg team and ERASMUS MC. The event was a total blast: 5 days in a remote area to work, code, have fun, eat and discuss with the 150 other participants from all Europe (even US)!

We worked, discussed and contributed on many projects: 
- [Bioconda packaging of the Regulatory Sequence Analysis Tools (RSAT)](https://github.com/elixir-europe/BioHackathon/tree/master/tools/Bioconda%20packaging%20of%20the%20%20Regulatory%20Sequence%20Analysis%20Tools%20RSAT)
- [bio.tools & EDAM](https://github.com/elixir-europe/BioHackathon/tree/master/tools/bio.tools%20%26%20EDAM%20drop-in%20hackathon%20%26%20discussions)
- [Development of BioJS components and their integration into Galaxy](https://github.com/elixir-europe/BioHackathon/tree/master/tools/Development%20of%20BioJS%20components)
- [SEEK Galaxy integration](https://github.com/elixir-europe/BioHackathon/tree/master/interoperability/Transfer%20of%20Research%20Assets%20between%20FAIRDOM%20SEEKs)
- [FAIRness of Training Materials](https://github.com/elixir-europe/BioHackathon/tree/master/training/Assessing%20the%20FAIRness%20of%20Training%20Materials)

But the main projects we worked on were:
- [Improve Shiny and RStudio integration within Galaxy using Galaxy Interactive Environment](https://github.com/elixir-europe/BioHackathon/tree/master/tools/Improve%20Shiny%20and%20RStudio%20integration%20within%20Galaxy%20using%20Galaxy%20Interactive%20Environment)

    During the 1,5 days allocated to our project, we completed some work on the GIE framework within Galaxy, developing a new Docker Volume plugin which provides the user's Galaxy history as a volume. Jupyter and RStudio will become even better with this addition.
   
- [Galaxy Training Material](https://github.com/elixir-europe/BioHackathon/tree/master/training/Galaxy%20training%20material%20improvement%20and%20extension)

    During these 5 days, we added some important functionalities to the [Galaxy Training Material](https://galaxyproject.github.io/training-material/):
    - Automatic translation of training material
    - Support learning path
    - Add Search on the website
    - Add a Training Handbook and philosophies

    We also reviewed Pull Requests, update and create new materials, etc.
