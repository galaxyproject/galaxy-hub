![Workflow Community initiative](/assets/media/workflows-community-logo.png)

The **Workflows Community Initiative** (WCI) has lunched the new website at [workflows.community](https://workflows.community).

The Freiburg Galaxy team is part of this Inititive to help improving computational workflows for everyone. 
Feel free to also join us on [this mission](http://join.workflows.community).

The website lists some workflow systems. Feel free to suggest to us other actively-developed open source systems that are not currently listed. 
Also, there is a rich set of metadata information that these systems could provide by adding a “.wci.yml” file to their system’s repository (more [information](https://workflows.community/systems/contribute)).

If you have any related events, please feel free to suggest other workflow-related events not currently listed in the website.
You can also use the [contribute feature](https://workflows.community/events/add).

And last but not least, feel free to suggest your workflow-related job openings to be added to the website. You can also use the [contribute feature](https://workflows.community/jobs/add).

We have also other collections in the website that we are still working on (registries, working groups, research frameworks, etc.), but you are welcome to explore and suggest ideas.
