The Freiburg Galaxy Team took several opportunities to present Galaxy as a FAIR 
data analysis and workflow management system, computing platform, training 
infrastructure and research data management system at various conferences and 
meetings. In the past couple of years, our team also significantly contributed to the 
development of some key Galaxy features, tools and tutorials. We also participated 
in several hackathons and held training events, training thousands of trainees
. The complete list of events and details can be accessed from the “Events” and 
“News” sections at [Europe subsite](https://galaxyproject.org/eu/). Some notable
 achievements are listed in this post.

# Conferences and Meetings
## [ELIXIR All Hands Meeting,  June 2024, Uppsala, Sweden](https://f1000research.com/documents/13-1086)
The team participated in several plenary sessions, mini symposia, ELIXIR 
networking activities and delivered workshops on single-cell data interoperability, 
Galaxy RDM, GTN, workflows and best practices. Please read our detailed post of 
this event [here](https://galaxyproject.org/news/2024-06-10-elixir-all-hands-meeting).

## [Galaxy Community Conference (GCC), June 2024, Brno, Czech Republic](https://galaxyproject.org/news/2024-07-19-gc-c2024-meeting-report/)
Co-organized by the Freiburg Galaxy team, the GCC2024 brought together 151 
participants from 28 countries for a week-long event focused on everything around 
Galaxy. Keynotes included talks on exposomics integration, role of Galaxy in 
[EOSC Federation building](https://eosc.eu/building-the-eosc-federation/), and genetic
 research using Galaxy. The conference featured 54 talks, 55 posters, and 14 
"Birds of a Feather" (BOF) sessions, alongside diverse training programs covering 
topics like Galaxy development and advanced scientific workflows. The 
Collaboration Fest (CoFest) encouraged collaborative development, with projects addressing 
workflow integration, training resources, and Galaxy feature enhancements. Our 
team actively participated in poster sessions, BOFs and delivered talks and 
workshops covering workflow development, front-end and back-end features, and 
highlighting developments from single-cell and microbiome communities.

## [Hosting R/Shiny applications on Galaxy, February 2024, Freiburg, Germany](https://galaxyproject.org/news/2024-08-21-hosting-shiny-apps-on-eu/)
Free computation resources for usage of R/Shiny applications for a large user 
base are generally scarce. Making these apps available on various large-scale 
compute platforms reduces the burden on platforms like 
[shinyapps.io](https://www.shinyapps.io/) where Shiny web apps are hosted. 
Some representatives of the Bioconductor community and the Galaxy Freiburg team 
together discussed the possibilities of simplifying Shiny apps deployment on Galaxy. 
During the hackathon, we generated a proof of concept for dockerization 
and deployment of Shiny apps as Galaxy interactive tools which eventually took off later this year.

## [Ask Us Anything about Galaxy live webinar, July 2024, online](https://galaxyproject.org/news/2024-07-29-ask-us-anything-report/)
To address the challenge of providing direct interaction with users despite a 
rapidly growing user base, our team initiated regular online meetings for Galaxy 
users to ask questions and receive support. The first session, held in July, 
attracted over 30 participants from multiple continents. Discussions during the Q&A 
covered topics such as analysis-specific tools and workflows, user disk quotas, 
user interface, and training materials, fostering engagement and addressing 
diverse user needs.
