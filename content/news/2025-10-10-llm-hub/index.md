## LLM Hub: Large Language Models Made Easy in Galaxy

Large Language Models (LLMs) are transforming research, helping with tasks from summarizing papers to analyzing complex text. But setting them up can be trickyâ€”API keys, subscriptions, and technical knowledge can get in the way.  

[LLM Hub](https://usegalaxy.eu/?tool_id=llm_hub) changes that. It brings powerful LLMs directly into Galaxy, so you can use them like any other Galaxy toolâ€”securely, privately, and without extra setup. Your data stays protected on the University of Freiburgâ€™s servers and is never permanently stored.  

## Available Models

LLM Hub offers a selection of models for different needs. All are hosted at the University of Freiburg, and more will be added over time.
