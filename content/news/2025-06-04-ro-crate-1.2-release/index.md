[Research Object Crate](https://www.researchobject.org/ro-crate/) specification [RO-Crate version 1.2](https://w3id.org/ro/crate/1.2) has been released.

[![RO-Crate](ro-crate-wide.svg)](https://www.researchobject.org/ro-crate/)

This release (<https://w3id.org/ro/crate/1.2>) marks the culmination of a large collaborative effort by the [RO-Crate community](https://www.researchobject.org/ro-crate/community), working closely with the Galaxy community through the projects [EuroScienceGateway](https://galaxyproject.org/projects/esg/) and [FAIR-EASE](https://fairease.eu/about), and multiple international collaborators.

## Release highlights

* Backwards-compatible, most metadata files can simply upgrade their version declaration from RO-Crate 1.1
* Formalisation of [profile crate](https://www.researchobject.org/ro-crate/specification/1.2/profiles), a mechanism for specialising the core RO-Crate profile
* New option of [detached crate](https://www.researchobject.org/ro-crate/specification/1.2/structure#types-of-ro-crate) for RO-Crate metadata files outside of a folder-like structure (e.g. as part of an API)
* Specified how to [reference other RO-Crates](https://www.researchobject.org/ro-crate/specification/1.2/data-entities#referencing-other-ro-crates), including their profile
* Specified how to [retrieve an RO-Crate](https://www.researchobject.org/ro-crate/specification/1.2/data-entities#retrieving-an-ro-crate), using [FAIR Signposting](https://signposting.org/FAIR/) ("Webby FDO")
* Editorial changes throughout with clarifications, improved language and examples

RO-Crate 1.2 constitutes a stable _long-term release_.
For a full list of updates, see the [changelog](https://www.researchobject.org/ro-crate/specification/1.2/appendix/changelog.html).

## RO-Crate governance

The release was approved by the recently formed [RO-Crate Steering Committee](https://github.com/ResearchObject/governance/blob/main/org-docs/STEERING-COMMITTEE.md), who follow the [Minimal Viable Governance](https://github.com/ResearchObject/governance) model, with a  mission to write, maintain and release versions of the RO-Crate specification and associated website, as well as advocating RO-Crate use.

The RO-Crate community is open for all to [contribute](https://github.com/ResearchObject/ro-crate/issues/1) or to join a [regional drop-in calls](https://www.researchobject.org/ro-crate/community#meetings) for any questions.


## About RO-Crate

Research Object Crate ([RO-Crate](https://www.researchobject.org/ro-crate/)) is a community effort to establish a lightweight approach to packaging research data with their metadata.

The RO-Crate specification defines a method of aggregating and describing data for distribution, re-use, publishing, preservation and archiving. RO-Crates aggregate data into a Dataset, and may describe any resource including files, URI-addressable resources, or use other addressing schemes to locate digital or physical data.

Describing resources includes technical metadata such as file sizes and types as well as contextual information including how and where datasets and files were created, how they were collated and collected, who was involved in the process, what equipment and software was used, who funded the work, how to cite it, and crucially, how it may be reused, and by whom.

The core of RO-Crate is a machine-readable linked-data document in JSON-LD format known as an RO-Crate Metadata Document. RO-Crate metadata documents can, to a large extent, be created and processed just like any other JSON: knowledge of JSON-LD is not needed, unless extending RO-Crate with additional concepts or combining RO-Crate with other Linked Data technologies.

## RO-Crate profiles in Galaxy

RO-Crate can be used for packaging any kind of dataset, but can also be used for workflow definitions and executions. RO-Crate 1.2 defines the concept of a [profile](https://www.researchobject.org/ro-crate/specification/1.2/profiles.html) to explicitly indicate the kind of content to be expected in a subset of RO-Crates.

Galaxy supports RO-Crate as an [export](https://galaxyproject.org/news/2023-02-23-structured-data-exports-ro-bco/) format for workflow runs and histories, which can then be published in repositories like [Zenodo](https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.13940793), and later imported into other Galaxy instances and used with [RO-Crate tooling](https://www.researchobject.org/ro-crate/tools) or combined in knowledge graphs. [WorkflowHub](https://workflowhub.eu/), supported by EuroScienceGateway, stores published workflows as RO-Crate.

These specialisations of RO-Crate can be formalised using the new profile mechanism, as already demonstrated for [Workflow Run RO-Crate](https://www.researchobject.org/workflow-run-crate/profiles/workflow_run_crate/), shown in Figure 1:

[Training material for RO-Crate](https://training.galaxyproject.org/training-material/topics/fair/) is provided as part of the Galaxy Training Network. Domain-specific training by FAIR-EASE is also available for [Earth-system RO-Crate](https://gxy.io/GTN:S00127) and as [webinar](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fxF6AJDXxGc). For [catalysis researchers](https://galaxyproject.org/news/2025-03-25-catalysis-reproduction-paper/), EuroScienceGateway and the [UK Catalysis Hub](https://ukcatalysishub.co.uk/) has created a [tutorial for importing RO-Crate](https://xerte.cardiff.ac.uk/play_22519) in the STFC Materials Galaxy instance.
