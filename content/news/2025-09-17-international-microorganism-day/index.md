Microbes—bacteria, fungi, viruses, and archaea—are invisible to the naked eye, but their impact is everywhere. They shape our health, drive Earth's ecosystems, and even influence the climate. On this [International Microorganism Day](https://www.internationalmicroorganismday.org/), we wanted to highlight worldwide research using Galaxy that are unlocking the secrets of these microscopic powerhouses, leading to breakthroughs in medicine, ecology, and sustainability.

## Decoding Pathogens:  The Hidden Threat

Pathogens—the bacteria and fungi that cause diseases—are constantly evolving. They're like master code-breakers, learning to resist our antibiotics and evade our immune systems. **But what if we could decode their secrets first?** Researchers are doing exactly that. With Galaxy, [scientists analyzed the genome of *Candida glabrata*, a fungus known for causing **difficult-to-treat hospital infections**](https://journals.asm.org/doi/full/10.1128/spectrum.00776-22). By pinpointing the specific genetic mutations that make it drug-resistant, they're providing a critical roadmap for developing new, more effective therapies.

## Solving the Superbug Mystery

**Antibiotic-resistant bacteria** are a global threat, but we're outsmarting them. Researchers are working to understand how these "superbugs" share their dangerous abilities. Using Galaxy, they're able to track **resistance genes** wherever they appear—from hospital waste to soil. They also identify plasmids, which are like a secret spy network of DNA molecules that carry resistance genes from one bacterium to another. This detective work allows us to see how superbugs **spread their resistance**, giving us a crucial head start in predicting and stopping outbreaks. The [ABRomics](https://www.abromics.fr/) platform, a project built on Galaxy, is helping French researchers lead the way in this fight.

## From Genetic Clues to Cures

The future of medicine is personalized, and microbes are key. By combining genetic and clinical data, scientists are now able to analyze the [microbial communities in the **lungs of cystic fibrosis** patients](https://journals.asm.org/doi/full/10.1128/msystems.00929-23). This research is identifying biomarkers—biological clues—that could lead to earlier diagnoses and treatments tailored to each individual.

In another groundbreaking study, [researchers used Galaxy and **Artificial Intelligence** (AI) to sift through vast public datasets](https://academic.oup.com/bib/article/26/2/bbaf177/8118857). Their goal? To find **microbial biomarkers for colorectal cancer**, which could pave the way for earlier detection and life-saving personalized treatments.

## The Invisible Engine of Life

Microbes are the unsung heroes of our planet. They drive essential processes like nutrient cycling and carbon storage. In one fascinating study, [a French team analyzed **microbes in cloud** water from the top of a volcano](https://bg.copernicus.org/articles/22/1257/2025/). Their work revealed how these tiny organisms are influenced by clouds and could in return influence atmospheric chemistry and even affect weather patterns.

In another project, [scientists used proteomics to map the functional roles of **microbes in the North Atlantic Ocean**, showing how they contribute to global carbon cycles and ocean health](https://bg.copernicus.org/articles/21/4889/2024/).

But the impact of these microbes extends far beyond the environment; Microbes affect (in)directly our own survival.


## Sustainable Farming for Our Future

From the ground up, microbes are crucial for plant growth and soil health. Using Galaxy, [scientists have identified beneficial bacteria in **plant root microbiomes** that help crops absorb nutrients](https://scijournals.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1002/jsfa.6577). This incredible discovery is already reducing the need for chemical fertilizers and paving the way for more sustainable and eco-friendly farming practices.

## A Global Community of Discovery

Microbial research isn't just for labs and universities. Galaxy supports inspiring projects that empower everyone to get involved. For instance, [BioDIGS](https://biodigs.org/#home) is a project that gives students from underserved communities the tools to study local microbial ecosystems. By doing so, it fosters a global network of collaboration and discovery that benefits everyone.


## Why This Research Matters

From fighting antibiotic resistance to understanding climate change, microbes hold the key to some of humanity's biggest challenges. At the heart of this work is **Galaxy** and the **Microbiology Galaxy Lab**, which is democratizing access to advanced bioinformatics. This platform makes it possible for scientists, clinicians, and even students around the world to analyze complex microbial data without needing specialized computational skills

The **[Microbiology Galaxy Lab](https://microbiology.usegalaxy.eu/)** is a free, globally accessible platform including over **315 tool suites and 115 curated workflows**. Whether you're tracking "superbugs", predicting disease biomarkers, or exploring how cloud microbes influence weather patterns, this platform supports research across health, ecology, and sustainability. With **FAIR-aligned** (Findable, Accessible, Interoperable, Reusable) workflows, over **35 tutorials**, and a vibrant community, it empowers researchers to share knowledge and accelerate discovery.

***But the impact goes even deeper...***

Projects like [ABRomics](https://www.abromics.fr/) and [BioDIGS](https://biodigs.org/) are tangible examples of how Galaxy fosters collaboration, from hospitals to local communities. By making cutting-edge tools accessible, Galaxy is not just advancing science; it's building a global community that can tackle the world's most pressing challenges together.

***What's next?***

As technology evolves, microbial research will continue to reveal new species, functions, and solutions we've yet to imagine. Whether you're a scientist, educator, or simply curious about the microscopic world, **Microbiology Galaxy Lab** offers the tools to explore, discover, and make a difference.
