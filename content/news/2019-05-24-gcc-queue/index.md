As Freiburg is hosting the [Galaxy Community Conference](https://gcc2019.sched.com/) this year, we will be allocating a lot of extra resources for training and events during the conference. To accomplish this, we will decrease the size of the main queue, and re-allocate these resources to the conference. You may notice that jobs take longer to run in the weeks before/during/after the conference, please be patient with us during this time. After the conclusion of the conference things will return to normal.
