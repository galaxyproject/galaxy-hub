 "**UseGalaxy – a bioinformatic shopping mall**
from Sivakumar Prakash

Whenever you see a black screen with lot of characters on your lab desktop, you might assume that, that was done by a SuperHuman who don’t use mouse for their operations – called Bioinformatician.

It is evidently daunting for noobs to understand the nooks and corners of command line to do anything. It was solved by UseGalaxy. Truly I learnt NGS analyses using Galaxy tool only. It had given me opportunity to play around and explore the things. Now I am aware of tools, the workflow, formats and output. Because of that trainings I can even use standalone tools with much ease.

And to be precise I can say UseGalaxy is a well organised and very helpful bioinformatic mall for dummies (not anymore) like me."
