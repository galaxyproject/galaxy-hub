We are excited to announce the integration of a Password Strength Indicator on the Galaxy registration page! This new feature provides real-time feedback to users, helping them create stronger and more secure passwords during the registration process.

## What’s New?

The Password Strength Indicator evaluates the strength of a password as users type, displaying a visual meter and color-coded feedback. 
By encouraging stronger passwords, we aim to reduce vulnerabilities and enhance account security.

## Why It Matters

* Improved Security: Encourages users to create stronger passwords, reducing the risk of compromised accounts.
* User-Friendly Experience: Provides clear, actionable feedback without overwhelming users with complex rules.
* Educational Value: Helps users understand what makes a password secure, promoting better security practices.

## How It Works

The component dynamically assesses password strength based on factors like length, complexity, and uniqueness. It integrates seamlessly into the existing registration workflow, ensuring a smooth and intuitive experience.
