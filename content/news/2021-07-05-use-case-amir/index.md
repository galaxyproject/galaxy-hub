__Amir Sabbaghian__ is using Galaxy at the [Advance Technologies Faculty, Golestan University of Medical Sciences Campus (Iran)](https://goums.ac.ir/index.php?slc_lang=en&sid=100) for colorectal cancer research. Thank you Amir for sharing your work with us!
 
Description of the project: 

> miRNAs with low fluctuations in blood samples of normal people and their comparison in patients with colorectal cancer have been evaluated
> via _in silico_ methods.
> The aim is to design miRNA based panels to detect colorectal cancer in the very early stages. This is now validated with qPCR.
> Previous studies with similar analyses in pancreatic cancer without wet lab work, just _in silico_. Other projects (soon to be published) are:
> 1. PI3k/Akt is the main pathway of cisplatin resistance in triple-negative breast cancer (Dr Memar).
> 2. Profiling pseudogenes with the least oscillation in the blood of healthy individual's compared to the blood of breast cancer patients (Mr Ramezanian).
> 3. Transcriptomics profiling with the least oscillation in the blood of healthy individuals compared to their blood of breast cancer patients (Ms Ahmadi).
> 4. Network and pathway-based drug repurposing for COVID-19 treatment (Ms Mirmohammadi).
