Prometheus is an increasingly popular monitoring solution whereby sites expose a /metrics endpoint, and then a central Prometheus server can scrape it for data which is then plotted or visualised or alerted upon. We at the GTN are now testing out a prometheus endpoint for our completely static site which we’ll use to expose some maybe useful statistics about the GTN that others can then scrape and display in ways that are useful for them.
