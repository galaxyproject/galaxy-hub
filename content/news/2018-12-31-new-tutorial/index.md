Maria Doyle has created a [new tutorial](https://galaxyproject.github.io/training-material/topics/transcriptomics/tutorials/rna-seq-viz-with-volcanoplot/tutorial.html){:target="_blank"} about the visualization of RNA-Seq results with Volcano plots.

Volcano plots are commonly used to display the results of RNA-seq or other omics experiments. A volcano plot is a type of scatterplot that shows statistical significance (P value) versus magnitude of change (fold change). It enables quick visual identification of genes with large fold changes that are also statistically significant. These may be the most biologically significant genes. In a volcano plot, the most upregulated genes are towards the right, the most downregulated genes are towards the left, and the most statistically significant genes are towards the top.

Thanks Maria and happy new year!
