With the recent appearance of novel SARS-CoV-2 lineages in the UK, South Africa
and Brazil, which are suspected to display increased infectivity and/or partial
escape from neutralizing antibodies, the need for continuous tracking of
viral evolution through genome sequencing has received increased public
attention.

While the UK's COVID-19 Genomics Consortium (COG-UK) has been pioneering such
monitoring since early on in the pandemic, other countries are now eager to
establish their own networks for genomic surveillance.

In the framework of [covid19.galaxyproject.org](https://covid19.galaxyproject.org), an international team of Galaxy
developers and researchers from different disciplines (including members of the
Galaxy EU team and the [Institute of Virology of the University Medical Center Freiburg](https://www.uniklinik-freiburg.de/virologie-en.html))
have collaborated since February last year to establish a set of workflows for
SARS-CoV-2 genomics analysis - including the ones that are urgently needed now.

The European Galaxy server offers these as
[__public workflows__](https://usegalaxy.eu/workflows/list_published).
Just search the list for the tag *covid19.galaxyproject.org* and you will find
our recommended, best-practice workflows for SARS-CoV-2 variant analysis from
a variety of sequencing data sources: be it whole-genome sequencing or
ampliconic (ARTIC) data sequenced using short-read (Illumina, single-end or
paired-end) or long-read (ONT) data, we have workflows for calling variants
(even low-frequency intra-sample ones), generating standardized
technology-independent reports, and for building reliable consensus sequences!

All you need to bring is your sequencing data, everything else you will need as
input to the workflows (SARS-CoV-2 reference genome, ARTIC primer
scheme, *etc.*) is already made available for you through a
public
[__COVID-19 Resources__](https://usegalaxy.eu/u/wolfgang-maier/h/covid-19-resources)
history.

Our workflows have been built and tested specifically with scalability in
mind: on [usegalaxy.eu](https://usegalaxy.eu) we have verified, using large batches of COG-UK and other
data, that they let you analyze even thousands of samples in parallel.

Combine, *e.g.*, our
[__ARTIC Illumina PE variant calling__](https://usegalaxy.eu/u/wolfgang-maier/w/covid19-variation-analysis-on-artic-pe)
workflow with the workflow for
[__consensus sequence building__](https://usegalaxy.eu/u/wolfgang-maier/w/covid-19-consensus-construction)
and you have an analysis pipeline for analyzing typical diagnostic batches of
data, like most of the data generated by COG-UK, and for turning the results
into a set of consensus sequences ready for submission to
[GISAID](https://www.gisaid.org) or for [clade assignment with Nextstrain](https://clades.nextstrain.org).

If, instead of reducing all the precise variant-calling information into a
simplifying consensus sequence, you would like to explore the full picture of
potential intra-sample variation, you could run our
[__variation reporting__](https://usegalaxy.eu/u/wolfgang-maier/w/covid19-variation-analysis-reporting)
workflow, which will create different graphical and tabular views on the
variant data, which you can use as a starting point for further investigation,
*e.g.* with [__Interactive Notebooks__](https://live.usegalaxy.eu) or using resources like
<https://observablehq.com/collection/@spond/intrahost-variant-exploration>.

Finally, in order to ensure open access to original sequencing data, we
stronlgy advocate, and offer
[tools](https://usegalaxy.eu/root?tool_id=toolshed.g2.bx.psu.edu/repos/iuc/ena_upload/ena_upload)
and assistance, for submitting *raw* sequencing data to public archives like
[ENA](https://www.ebi.ac.uk/ena) - so that everyone can reanalyze the data and
draw their own conclusions.
