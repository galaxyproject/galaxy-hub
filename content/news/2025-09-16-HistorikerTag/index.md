# The Freiburg Galaxy team participated in the German Historikertag

The 55. [Historikertag](https://www.historikertag.de/Bonn2025/en/) took place in Bonn from September 16-19, 2025.
It is the largest platform for German-speaking historians, dating back to the 19th century.
This year, the Freiburg Galaxy team joined for the first time.
Starting a new project in Digital History can be overwhelming. Where can I start? How can I access tools to analyse my texts, images or other data without knowing how to program? 
This is where Galaxy can help.

Our [poster "Approaching Digital History with the Open Source Platform Galaxy"](https://zenodo.org/records/17016028) was a conversation starter for all of the above challenges.
It explains what resources the platform offers and how the Open Educational Resources from the [Galaxy Training Network](https://training.galaxyproject.org/training-material/topics/digital-humanities/) help guide researchers' first steps.
Set in the old Senate's room, this definitely ranks among the most historic setups of our team's poster presentations to date.
