Back in September 2024, we ran the Open University Bioinformatics Bootcamp—a free, five-day online course introducing students to the core tools and techniques used in single-cell biology. We were genuinely delighted by the level of interest: 120 students signed up, 100 showed up, and around 80 worked through the hands-on tutorials during the week. That’s a fantastic level of engagement, especially for a course that’s entirely optional and doesn’t count towards their degree.
