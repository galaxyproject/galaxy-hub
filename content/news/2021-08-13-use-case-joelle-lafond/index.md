on sex determination of fish. Thank you very much Joëlle for sharing the goal of your project with us!

> Sex determination of a fish species, and its link to hybridization by studying the sex determination of one of the parental species, which reproduces normally and has a usual sex-ratio. Our goal is to understand a bit better what happens to those genes when two different species reproduce and form a sexually viable hybrids, in which the sex-ratio are often skewed toward one sex or the other.
