We are pleased to announce the *[Galaxy Training Network (GTN)](/news/galaxy-training-network/index.md)*, a network of trainers who teach bioinformatics using Galaxy, or teach about Galaxy itself.  The GTN aims to make it easy to find Galaxy trainers, and to share and discover the wealth of training resources available for Galaxy.  This includes training materials, a trainer directory, best practices, and guidance on computing platforms for teaching with Galaxy.  The Galaxy Training Network is accessible to the entire community.

If you teach with Galaxy, then please consider adding your organization, materials, and best practices. The Trainer Directory already includes 16 organizations and there may be one (or 6!) near you.

Thanks,

The [Galaxy Training Network (GTN)](https://training.galaxyproject.org/)
