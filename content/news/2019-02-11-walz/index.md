## Abstract

**Background** Human retinal microvascular endothelial cells (HRMVECs) are involved in the pathogenesis of
retinopathy of prematurity. In this study, the microRNA (miRNA) expression profiles of
HRMVECs were investigated under resting conditions, angiogenic stimulation (VEGF treatment) and anti-VEGF treatment.

**Materials and methods** The miRNA profiles of HRMVECs under resting and angiogenic conditions (VEGF treatment),
as well as after addition of aflibercept, bevacizumab or ranibizumab were evaluated by analyzing the transcriptome
of small non-coding RNAs. Differentially expressed miRNAs were validated using qPCR and classified using Gene Ontology enrichment analysis.

**Results** Ten miRNAs were found to be significantly changed more than 2-fold. Seven of these miRNAs were
changed between resting conditions and angiogenic stimulation. Four of these miRNAs (miR-139-5p/-3p and miR-335-5p/-3p) were validated by qPCR in independent experiments and 
were found to be associated with angiogenesis and cell migration in Gene Ontology analysis. In addition, analysis of the most abundant miRNAs in the HRMVEC miRNome (representing 
at least 1% of the miRNome) was conducted and identified miR-21-5p, miR-29a-3p, miR-100-5p and miR-126-5p/-3p to be differently expressed by at least 15% between resting 
conditions and angiogenic conditions. These miRNAs were found to be associated with apoptotic signaling, regulation of kinase activity, intracellular signal transduction, cell 
surface receptor signaling and positive regulation of cell differentiation in Gene Ontology analysis. No differentially regulated miRNAs between angiogenic stimulation and 
angiogenic stimulation plus anti-VEGF treatment were identified.

**Conclusion** In this study we characterized the miRNA profile of HRMVECs under resting, angiogenic and anti-angiogenic conditions and identified several miRNAs of potential 
pathophysiologic importance for angioproliferative retinal diseases. Our results have implications for possible miRNA-targeted angiomodulatory approaches in diseases like 
diabetic retinopathy or retinopathy of prematurity.
