Galaxy is an **open-access, web-based platform for data-intensive computational research**. It is used in a variety of domains, including **microbial data analysis**: for microbiome samples or bacterial isolates, long reads or short, shotgun or 16S, genomics, transcriptomics, or proteomics.

**[microGalaxy](/community/sig/microbial/#microgalaxy-community)**, a community of practice focused on microbial data analysis in Galaxy, would like to **learn** more about **use-cases** where Galaxy was beneficial, and also the **barriers that prevent researchers from using Galaxy**. The aim is to collectively **find solutions** to improve user experience and reduce barriers.

To this end, we are launching a **[survey](https://forms.gle/QZ6tzZ2uRpayuSVSA)** to reach out to, and learn from, the microbial research community.

## How will the results of the survey be used?

The results of this survey will be used to
1. build a **roadmap** for the community to solve the identified problems and supporting better microbial data analysis in Galaxy, and;
2. share about the benefits of Galaxy for microbial data analysis by writing a **use-case driven community-oriented paper**.

## Who could fill this survey?

**Anyone** who
* has used Galaxy for any kind of microbial focused research (e.g. metagenomics, metatranscriptomics, microbiome, bacterial isolates), or
* conducts microbial research or is planning to do so, but has not yet used Galaxy, or is hindered by certain aspects of Galaxy from using it.

The more answers, the better understanding of how to improve Galaxy for the microbial research community we will get. Thank You!

## Until when can I fill the survey?

We open the survey for one month from **March 21st until April 21st**.

## Where can I find the survey?

The survey is available as a Google form and can be directly filled in here:
