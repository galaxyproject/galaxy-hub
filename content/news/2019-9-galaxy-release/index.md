We are pleased to announce the release of Galaxy
19.09 - **[developer and admin release announcement](https://docs.galaxyproject.org/en/master/releases/19.09_announce.html)** and **[user release announcement](https://docs.galaxyproject.org/en/master/releases/19.09_announce_user.html)**.
A few release highlights are:

Interactive Tools
-----------------

A new type of Galaxy tool has been implemented that allows interactive experiences like Galaxy Interactive Environments (via a proxy and Docker containers) but using plugins defined with Galaxy’s XML tool syntax.

Workflow Invocation Reports
---------------------------

Workflows may now define Markdown templates with Galaxy-specific embedded syntax extensions that can tie together workflow inputs, outputs, jobs, and metadata into rich reports.

New Toolshed Client Interface
-----------------------------

This project drove numerous enhancements to the Tool Shed API, including vastly improved search functionality. This interface has been completely re-imagined and feels much more interactive.

_Thanks for using Galaxy!_
