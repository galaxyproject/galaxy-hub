It is a very busy time in the Galaxy. 2021 is young, but we have already had two large training events, including the largest Galaxy event ever - the GTN Smörgåsbord (with an amazing 1100+ people registered). We are ramping up for GCC2021, which will be online, global, and affordable, and will be more accessible (and likely much larger) than an in-person Galaxy Community Conference.

Galaxy is also shifting with the times, and to reflect how our community has grown.  This newsletter includes a new **[Featured News](#featured-news)** section highlighting 1) the **recent explosion of videos** related to Galaxy, 2) a draft **global governance model for Galaxy**, and 3) the new **Galaxy Career Center.**

That's followed by another new section highlighting **[community news](#community-news).** Arguably, *everything* here is community news, but items listed here particularly emphasize the community aspects of Galaxy.

The newsletter still includes sections on

* **[upcoming events](#event-news)**,
* news about **[public Galaxy platforms](#galaxy-platforms-news)**,
* recent **[blog posts](#galactic-blog-activity)**,
* **[training and doc updates](#doc-hub-and-training-updates)**,
* recent **[open-access Galaxy-related publications](#publications)**, and
* **[new releases](#releases).**

It's a lot to take in, but it all highlights the breadth and depth of the Galaxy Community.

Enjoy,

Dave Clements and Beatriz Serrano-Solano, Editors

[Galaxy Videos](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCwoMMZPbz1L9AZzvIvrvqYA)

</div>

When Galaxy started, *screencasts* were a big part of our documentation and training.  Fifteen years later videos have returned to Galaxy with a vengeance.  This is partly due to the pandemic, and partly due to a long term global shift towards recording events, and towards creating short demonstration and introduction videos.

A number of notable videos and video collections have recently been published:

* <strong><a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCwoMMZPbz1L9AZzvIvrvqYA/playlists?view=50&sort=dd&shelf_id=2">Galaxy Smörgåsbord Collection</a></strong>
    * This collection of 43 videos was created for the recently completed Galaxy Smörgåsbord training event.  They cover a huge sample of the Galaxy Training Network materials.
* **[Galaxy Admin Training Collection](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCwoMMZPbz1L9AZzvIvrvqYA/playlists?view=50&sort=dd&shelf_id=3)**
    * This collection of 27 videos was created for the also recently completed 2021 Galaxy Admin Training event.  Everything you ever wanted to know about administering your own Galaxy instance (well, almost).
* **[Quick Tips](https://youtube.com/playlist?list=PLNFLKDpdM3B8__nz2xlzY2bA_2Sb_vb2o)**
    * Nine videos (and growing), each under 3 minutes, providing brief introductions to commonly used features of Galaxy.
* **[Galactic Introductions](https://youtube.com/playlist?list=PLNFLKDpdM3B9UaxWEXgziHXO3k-003FzE)**
    * Covers a wide range of galaxy features.  Videos range from 24 seconds (History: Sharing via link) to 12 and half minutes (Galaxy and NGS)
* <strong><a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCwoMMZPbz1L9AZzvIvrvqYA/playlists?view=50&sort=dd&shelf_id=7">Developer resources</a></strong>
    * Includes [Developer Quick Dives](https://youtube.com/playlist?list=PLNFLKDpdM3B8Ro-V0mZboQjj40RimRZ8n), short videos introducing common tasks in Galaxy development; and [Galaxy Developer Roundtables](https://youtube.com/playlist?list=PLNFLKDpdM3B-j7cdWzG3Qh5609fZK4fvO), recordings of the bi-weekly [Galaxy Developer Roundtable](/community/devroundtable/) calls.
* **[Webinars & Workshops](https://youtube.com/playlist?list=PLNFLKDpdM3B8beIdQKVP8zES47v5rooQm)**
    * Recordings of Galaxy Webinars and Workshops are spread across the web.  This playlist attempts to list recent webinars that we know about that are on YouTube.  This list is brand new and is rapidly expanding.

[Working Groups](/community/wg/) and the [draft Galaxy Governance Model](/community/governance/)

</div>

In December, Galaxy introduced [Working Groups](/community/wg/), community-driven small groups that manage different aspects of the Galaxy Ecosystem. Working groups set quarterly milestones for their areas, distribute work, and meet to discuss progress and roadblocks. Working Groups were launched in late 2020.  *If you want to contribute to Galaxy in a big way, please join one or more Working Groups.*

This month we are introducing the first draft of a [Galaxy Governance Model](/community/governance/) that includes Working Groups as a key component.  The model also includes the new [Galaxy Executive Board](/community/governance/geb/), the Global Galaxy Steering Committee, and incorporates the longstanding [Committers Groups](/community/committers/).

Our hope is that this framework will enable us to become a truly global community.

Despite COVID-19, there is still a lot going on, and most of it is online. See the [full list of events](/events/). Some highlights:

<br />
*Galaxy-ELIXIR webinars series: Advanced Features*

With this series of four [webinars](https://elixir-europe.org/events/galaxy-elixir-webinars-series-advanced-features) chaired by Hans-Rudolf Hotz, the global Galaxy community will present advanced features that may have remain unknown due to the rapid developments in every Galaxy release. The series will touch upon workflows, data processing and management, interoperability and interactive tools, among others.

**Advanced Galaxy workflow features**, *3 March*, [watch the video](https://youtu.be/7atWvOoMQwE)

**Processing thousands of datasets simultaneously**, *10 March* [watch the video](https://youtu.be/7DN8hbI87PE)

*GCC2021 will start on 28 June with a [week of online training](https://galaxyproject.org/events/gcc2021/training/).* Training will largely use the GTN Smörgåsbord model: Lectures will be prerecorded, with live help available on chat for the duration of the week.  This model allows participants to learn at their own pace, avoids scheduling conflicts that are inherent with our usual multi-track training, and enables those with low bandwidth internet connections to fully participate.

We also expect to open registration and abstract submission shortly.  Registration discounts will be available to researchers from low and lower-middle income countries.  For everyone else, registration will be downright cheap too.  We will reuse the BCC2020 model for talks, posters, and demos: Posters and demos will be live (sometimes in both hemispheres), and talks will be prerecorded.

**And [GCC2021 is looking for sponsors](http://bit.ly/gcc2021_prospectus_v1) too!**

Please watch Galaxy channels for the registration and abstract submission announcements.

This new tutorial will take you from raw FASTQ files to a cell x gene data matrix in AnnData format. What’s a data matrix, and what’s AnnData format? Well you’ll find out! Importantly, this is the first step in processing single cell data in order to start analysing it.

Plus the theoretical background of sequence comparison, including why some tools are suitable for some jobs and others are not.

After the success of the first [‘Galaxy-ELIXIR webinar series: FAIR data and Open Infrastructures to tackle the COVID-19 pandemic’](https://elixir-europe.org/events/webinar-galaxy-elixir-covid19) last spring, the Galaxy community has been running a second Galaxy-ELIXIR webinar series on [‘Open Data Infrastructures to tackle COVID-19 pandemic’](https://elixir-europe.org/events/2nd-galaxy-elixir-webinar-series).

In this second edition, and for six consecutive weeks, speakers from all around the globe have been describing the latest Galaxy developments for working with SARS-CoV-2 data. If you missed them, the recordings are now available on the [ELIXIR Europe YouTube channel](https://www.youtube.com/c/ELIXIREurope).
