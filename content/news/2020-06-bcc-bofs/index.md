Birds of a Feather (BoFs) are informal, self-organized meetups focused on specific topics. They are a great way to meet other like-minded community members and have an in-depth discussion on a topic of interest, and they are a highlight of Galaxy conferences

**Any BCC2020 participant is welcome to [propose a BoF by July 10](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSdMv8CEKNVGsnwM0S6G2fXWU256hfyhttaKn6az754OoUXXPQ/viewform)!** All you need is a title, an organizer, and a brief description. BoFs can be scheduled right before and after the main meeting day in both hemispheres.
