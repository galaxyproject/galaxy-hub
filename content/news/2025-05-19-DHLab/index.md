In cooperation with the [Digital Humanities Lab](https://digitalhumanities.uni-freiburg.de/dh-lab/) we introduced Galaxy's applicability for Digital Humanities (DH) and Research Data Management (RDM) at the University of Freiburg. 
The room was filled with researchers from various fields, who were curious how the [European Galaxy Server](https://usegalaxy.eu/) could help in their DH journey and help them make their research reproducible.
The 90 minutes were enough time to give a brief introduction, reproduce the first steps of a [training](https://training.galaxyproject.org/training-material/topics/digital-humanities/tutorials/text_mining_chinese/tutorial.html) for text comparison and brainstorm about the communities' needs in their research.
Thanks to the people from the DH lab for the organisation that made the exchange possible and thanks to all participants for their valuable feedback and input. We are excited about what comes next!
