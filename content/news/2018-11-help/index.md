**We are pleased to announce *[Galaxy Help](https://help.galaxyproject.org/)*, the new Galaxy Community Q&A web site.**  Galaxy Help joins the Galaxy Matrix channels, Galaxy mailing lists and the Galaxy Hub as [another place to get answers to your Galaxy related questions](/support/).

Galaxy Help replaces *[Galaxy BioStars](https://biostar.usegalaxy.org/)*, which is being retired after almost 5 years of service.  (Galaxy BioStars was itself a replacement for the earlier *galaxy-user* mailing list.)  The Galaxy BioStars site will remain up as a read-only archive (and will still be searched by the [Galaxy Hub search](/search/)).

*[Join the discussion](https://help.galaxyproject.org/).*
