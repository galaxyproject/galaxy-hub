Galactic Training is going Global in 2021! After the success of the ELIXIR-Europe series of Machine Learning webinars, the [Galaxy Training Network](https://training.galaxyproject.org) is scaling up and hosting two events with global reach in January and February

Both of these will be **online** events, spanning **all time zones**. All training sessions are pre-recorded, so you can work through them **at your own pace**, and manage your own time. A large community of GTN trainers & admins will be available via **online support** to answer all your questions.

## January 25-29, 2021: Galaxy Admin Training

This workshop will cover introductory and advanced topics you need to know to set up your own production, high-performance and multi-user Galaxy instance. Sessions will be intensive and hands-on, and taught by experienced instructors from the Galaxy Community. Participants will learn how to install, configure, customize, and extend their own Galaxy servers. Topics include tool configuration, authentication and user management, using heterogeneous storage and compute services, and many other topics that will enable you to get your own Galaxy server up and running, performing well, and used by your community.

**The workshop is free. However, space is limited and applications are expected to be competitive. Please submit an application by the end of December 18.**
