The Galaxy community is undergoing an __organizational transformation__, with the main focus on improving the global coordination in different areas by defining [__Working Groups__](https://galaxyproject.org/community/wg/). The motivations behind this shift are the rapid growth of the community and its diversity.

The Working Groups are open to everyone, with members __distributed across the globe__, and assorted in the topics covered  (admin, backend, UI/UX...). The set of working groups and their missions will evolve over time.

Each working group has the __autonomy__ to organize themselves internally and is responsible for __defining goals__ in each quarter of the year. Those goals, together with the input from the community and the steering committee, will be incorporated into the __community roadmap__.

The Working Groups provide __entry points__ into the community for new members, will __improve the communication__ between experts and will help with __channelling the contributions__. 

This new organization has been discussed in two Developer Roundtables and the ELIXIR-Galaxy community has been informed in the monthly meetings.

If you want to contribute to a particular area, there are channels to get in touch with each [Working Group](https://galaxyproject.org/community/wg/). Please don't hesitate to [contact us](mailto:galaxy@informatik.uni-freiburg.de) if you have questions or concerns.
