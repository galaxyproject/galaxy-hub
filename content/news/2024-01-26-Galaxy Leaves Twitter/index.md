Hello Galaxy Users!

After careful consideration, Galaxy has decided to leave Twitter/X, effective March 31st, 2024. This decision comes as we believe the platform no longer aligns with Galaxy's strong commitment to successfully and respectfully facilitating scientific discourse.

At Galaxy, we value open and constructive discussions that contribute to the advancement of scientific knowledge. Unfortunately, recent changes on Twitter/X have made it challenging for us to maintain the level of discourse we strive for.

We appreciate the support and engagement we have received from our community on Twitter/X, and we want to assure you that this decision was not made lightly. We remain dedicated to providing a platform that fosters meaningful conversations and supports the scientific community.

While we bid farewell to Twitter/X, we invite you to stay connected with Galaxy through our other communication channels, where we will be cross-posting all our social media contributions. You can find us on [BlueSky](https://bsky.app/profile/galaxyproject.bsky.social), [Mastodon](https://mstdn.science/@galaxyproject), and [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/groups/4907635/), and of course, you can stay up to date by visiting the 
[Galaxy Hub](https://galaxyproject.org/). Additionally, we encourage you to stay connected with the [Galaxy Training Network](https://training.galaxyproject.org/), who are active on [BlueSky](https://bsky.app/profile/galaxytraining.bsky.social) and [Mastodon](https://mstdn.science/@gtn). 

We appreciate your ongoing support and look forward to continuing our journey with you and maintaining the strong sense of community that defines Galaxy.

Thank you for using Galaxy!
