There are many tools that help measure mental health. Two assessment tools have been chosen for this project: the **Mental Health Inventory** and the **General Health Questionnaire**. You can either use one or both assessment tools. Note that the assessment tools are **NOT** supposed to serve as a diagnosis or as a substitute for a professional opinion.

# Mental Health Inventory (MHI-38)

The MHI was developed by Veit and Ware, which helps assess general psychological distress and well-being. The MHI can be scored as a 

* Global mental health index with higher scores indicating less psychological distress and greater psychological well-being (which is used in this project).
* Two global scales indicating either the level of psychological well-being (higher scores indicating greater well-being) or psychological distress (higher scores indicating greater distress).
* Six subscale scores (General Positive Affect, Life Satisfaction, Emotional Ties, Depression, Anxiety, and Loss of Behavioural/Emotional Control) (higher scores indicating more of the construct described by the subscale name) (Veit, & Ware, 1983).

All the MHI items are scored on a six-point scale (1-6) except for items 9 and 28, which are scored on a five-point scale (1-5). **The raw score range is 38–226, with higher scores on the Mental Health Index indicating less psychological distress and greater psychological well-being**. The items that make up the many subscales and global scales may be reverse-scored depending on the measured underlying construct (Veit, & Ware, 1983). To learn more about the scoring, check the MHI appendix section [here](https://www.amhocn.org/sites/default/files/publication_files/nocc_clinician_and_self-report_measures_overview_v2.1_20210913_1.pdf). The reliability of the MHI has a Cronbach Alpha of .94 (Pandya, 2018). **To access the MHI on Google Sheets, click [here](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1VDdqG_3U0qqQpgDa6wTkka-WoxsEBa15oFWgfN_CIQY/edit?usp=sharing) and make your own copy to be able to use the sheet**. You can fill out the questionnaire regularly every month and keep track of your scores to monitor your mental health over time.

# General Health Questionnaire (GHQ-12)

The GHQ-12 was developed by Goldberg, which helps measure psychological distress. It comprises six positively worded items (1, 3, 4, 7, 8 & 12) and six negatively worded items (2, 5, 6, 9, 10 & 11) concerning the past few weeks of a person’s life. It includes positive items such as “Felt you were playing a useful part in things?" while negative items include "Lost much sleep over worry?” (Hu et al., 2007). 

The reliability of the GHQ-12 Likert method scoring has Cronbach's Alpha of 0.90 (Hankins, 2008). Every item has four options with scores ranging from 0 to 3. **Total scores range from 0 to 36, with higher scores indicating higher levels of psychological distress**. The scores are obtained by adding the numbers from the responses (Romppel et al., 2013). **To access the GHQ on Google Sheets, click [here](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1Kk5_L1Ca3KGhVwWxQ17wUxVqZRg8BiFEW-SveVOe3Sk/edit?usp=sharing) and make your own copy to be able to use the sheet**. You can fill out the questionnaire regularly every few weeks and keep track of your scores to monitor your mental health over time.
