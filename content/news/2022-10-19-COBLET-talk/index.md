The first [Colloquium on Bioinformatics Learning, Education and Training (CoBLET)](https://coblet2022.bezmialem.edu.tr/)
took place in Istambul, between the 11th and 14th of October.
The event was held under the main theme of drawing a route for bioinformatics education and training, with a special focus in
four mayor topics: emerging technologies, innovative pedagogical methods, industrial applications and sustaintable development.
It took place in the Beykoz Institute of Life Sciences and Biotechnology at Bezmialem Vakıf University, and also offered online participation.
This event hold also the 11th annual general meeting of the Global Organisation for Bioinformatics Learning, Education and Training (GOBLET).
