The [PeerJ Best Poster/Demonstration Award](https://gcc2021.sched.com/sponsor/peerj) was awarded to:

* [Th-6.8: Peptide mass spectrometry imaging of pancreatic cancers – A data analysis workflow in Galaxy](https://sched.co/k5N0)
* Presented by Maren Stillger of the University of Freiburg

Maren's presentation took full advantage of the Remo conference platform, which means that the presentation was not a single PDF, but was rather interactive.  Maren's work will be highlighted in the PeerJ Blog, and this work is eligible for free publication in any PeerJ journal.

We are very pleased to announce that the [Galaxy India community](https://www.galaxyproject.in/) has started!  Galaxy India had a [soft launch during GCC2021](https://sched.co/kLwE).  **We are planning a full community launch with [two days of pre-conference workshops at InBix 2021](https://easychair.org/cfp/InBix2021).**

The Galaxy India community is about enabling data intensive research and instruction in India using the Galaxy platform. As a group, we sponsor:

* Training and workshops, both standalone and at larger meetings
* Webinars and community calls
* In person gatherings, once these become prudent
* [Communications channels](/community/#regional-communities), including chat and a mailing list
* An [India-focused server](/use/galaxy-india/) hosted by the European Galaxy Team

If you are working in data intensive science in India then please consider getting involved with Galaxy India:

[SARS-CoV-2 Data Analysis and Monitoring with Galaxy](https://galaxyproject.eu/event/2021-06-21-sars-cov-2-data-analysis-monitoring-training/)

</div>

**9-12 August**

The goal of this workshop is to build capacity in SARS-CoV-2 data analysis and data management, including data submission to ENA. After the workshop, all participants will be able to upload viral sequencing data, call all variants, create a variety of reports and create consensus alignments.

It will be a 4-day event introducing scalable and reproducible SARS-CoV-2 data analysis with Galaxy. The sessions will be pre-recorded and provided in advance. During the workshop, there will be live support in chat and live Q&A sessions, in which experts will answer questions.
