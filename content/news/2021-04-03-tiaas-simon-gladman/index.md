We recently used TIaaS for a couple of our national bioinformatics training workshops and it was wonderful. The workshop participant's jobs were all queued, run and finished quickly enough so that we had plenty of time to concentrate on our teaching and explanation of the science rather than worrying about compute issues. The status page is a godsend, especially in remote learning situations. We can monitor all students progress through the work and gauge the pace of our delivery. We loved it so much that we have now setup TIaaS on Galaxy Australia. Thanks so much Europe for TIaaS.
