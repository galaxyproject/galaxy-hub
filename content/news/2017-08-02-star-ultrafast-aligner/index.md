For the mapping of non-contiguous transcripts, this program was developed.
[STAR's speed and reliability have been proven](https://academic.oup.com/bioinformatics/article-lookup/doi/10.1093/bioinformatics/bts635). The mapper was recently updated on this server and several often used reference genomes
are already online.

If you want to map RNA data from RNA-seq or CLIP experiments, consider using STAR.

If the reference genome of your organism or the gene-model is not yet available, [let us know](mailto:galaxy@informatik.uni-freiburg.de) and we will add it, as soon as possible.
