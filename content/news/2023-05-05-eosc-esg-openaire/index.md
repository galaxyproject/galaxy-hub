The **Open Access Infrastructure for Research in Europe (OpenAIRE)** is a pan-European network for research information and publications funded by the European Commission (EC). Operating since 2009, OpenAIRE is an integral part and a leading force behind the European Open Science Cloud (EOSC) developments. The Horizon 2020 OpenAIRE-Nexus project is the currently running funding phase, forming a consortium of 11 partners, bringing a set of services to implement and accelerate Open Science and tools embedded in researchers' workflows in Europe, EOSC and the world. Its mission is to make it easier for scientists to accept and uptake Open Science practices of openness and FAIRness.

[**EuroScienceGateway**](https://galaxyproject.org/projects/esg/) started as an EOSC project in 2022 and aims to facilitate access to compute and storage infrastructures across Europe as well as to data, tools, workflows and services that can be customized to suit researchers’ needs. At the heart of the proposal, workflows will integrate with the EOSC-Core. Adoption, development and implementation of technologies to interoperate across services will allow researchers to produce high-quality FAIR data available to all in EOSC.

The collaboration with [OpenAIRE](https://www.openaire.eu) and [EuroScienceGateway](https://galaxyproject.org/projects/esg/) **aims to increase the FAIRness of the research produced by the communities using Galaxy and improve the data quality by providing feedback to the OpenAIRE mining team and on the novel entries of the OpenAIRE Graph**. This will be useful to guide researchers, research staff, data stewards, and data scientists to find tunes in the Open Science practices and training.

The two teams will focus on the identification of the metadata resources present in the OpenAIRE Graph, verifying the collections of the records, and making them available to the research community through the EuroScienceGateway in [OpenAIRE CONNECT](https://catalogue.openaire.eu/service/openaire.research_community_dashboard/overview). 

Notably, the Zenodo research data repository is a product of OpenAIRE. Both Zenodo and OpenAIRE are integral elements in EuroScienceGateway's project structure, being addressed in [ESG's work package 2](https://galaxyproject.org/projects/esg/#work-packages) ('Stimulate FAIR and reusable research'). Thus, having gained these resources as active partners now is a considerable driving force for reaching common aims and boosting Galaxy efforts in research data management.
