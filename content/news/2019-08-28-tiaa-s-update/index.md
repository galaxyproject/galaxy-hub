We've seen the [TIaaS Queue Status](https://galaxyproject.eu/tiaas) receive a lot of positive feedback. We've added two new features to support trainers using this service:

- Auto-refresh: now you can turn this on to have the page automatically refresh every 5 seconds. This saves you pressing the refresh button constantly
- Filtering by different time ranges: You can now select to see jobs in the past 1, 3, or 6 hours. Other numbers are possible via changing the URL

Check them out now on our [test page](https://usegalaxy.eu/join-training/test/status)!
