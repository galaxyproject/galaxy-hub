# Galaxy Hackathon in Brest, France: Innovation on the Edge of the Ocean

## March 18th‚Äì20th, 2025 | Brest, France üåä

From **March 18th to 20th**, developers, researchers, and ocean data experts gathered in **Brest, France**, for a vibrant and hands-on **Hackathon** as part of **FAIR-EASE**. Set against the scenic backdrop of the Atlantic coast, the event brought together a dedicated group of innovators to build workflows, deploy tools, and push the boundaries of interoperability and FAIR data practices.

## üåü The Galaxy Challenge: From SAMBA to SAGA

A major highlight of the event was the **Galaxy Challenge**, focused on adapting the **[SAMBA workflow](https://gitlab.ifremer.fr/bioinfo/workflows/samba)**‚Äîdeveloped by **Ifremer**‚Äîinto a fully functional, Galaxy-compatible pipeline: **SAGA**.

- The effort began with a creative ‚Äúprototype‚Äù Galaxy workflow ([check it out](https://usegalaxy.eu/u/marie.josse/w/unnamed-workflow)) and a [PR to `tools-iuc`](https://github.com/ifremer-bioinformatics/tools-iuc/pull/1) to integrate key tools.
- Participants wrapped the missing `dbotu3` tool and began developing a wrapper for **microDecon**, to handle contamination in metabarcoding data.

- The **SAGA** workflow was then rebuilt and polished from scratch using SAMBA‚Äôs logic and the prototype as a base.

## OGC API Meets Galaxy

The hackathon also tackled interoperability head-on with experiments in **OGC API - Processes** using the [fair-ease-galaxy-ogcapi](https://github.com/dmeaux/fair-ease-galaxy-ogcapi) project. The team successfully queried Galaxy‚Äôs API to produce compliant process records via FastAPI Swagger‚Äîa promising step toward broader data service integration.

## ‚ö° Hackathon Highlights: Tools, Metadata & Scheduling

The energy in the room led to fast-paced development and great progress thanks to **Sanjay**, **Paul**, **Marie**, and **Eli** and all others that contributed:
Members of the European Galaxy community achieved the following:

- ‚úÖ **TerriaMap Interactive Tool** added to Galaxy  
  - [Tool link](https://usegalaxy.eu/root?tool_id=interactive_tool_terriamap)  
  - [Repo](https://github.com/usegalaxy-eu/galaxy/tree/release_24.2_europe/tools/interactive/terriamap)

- ‚úÖ **[RO-Crate validation](https://rocrate-validator.readthedocs.io/en/stable/)** support added in Galaxy testing
- ‚úÖ Deployment of **two new ocean biogeochemistry tools**, with one updated
- ‚úÖ **Pulsar integration** completed on UCA testbed  
  - [Integration PR](https://github.com/usegalaxy-eu/infrastructure-playbook/pull/1447)

- ‚úÖ Ongoing work on **OGC API process generation** using a generic JSON builder
- ‚úÖ Strategic advancement of **TPV meta-scheduling** including:  
  - Updated consumer scripts and broker functionality  
  - Metrics collection via **Telegraf + InfluxDB**  
  - Deployment coordination with **[EuroScienceGateway (ESG)](https://galaxyproject.org/projects/esg/) WP3 [Pulsar](https://galaxyproject.org/cloudman/services/pulsar/) admins**  
  - Migration of the **[TotalPerspectiveVortex](https://total-perspective-vortex.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) (TPV) Broker and consumer** to the EU infrastructure  
  - Long-term planning for stable EU deployment

## Looking Ahead

As waves crashed outside, ideas flowed inside. The **Hackathon in Brest** laid the groundwork for exciting future developments. Next steps include:

- Advancing **OGC API integration** into Galaxy workflows  
- Enriching RO-Crate metadata with spatial and temporal context  
- Exploring the **Hunga Tonga Challenge** for Galaxy-based contributions
