We've seen the [TIaaS Queue Status](https://galaxyproject.eu/tiaas) receive a lot of positive feedback.
Todas Helena added two new features to get a general information about the TIaaS service.

- [a Calendar](https://usegalaxy.eu/tiaas/calendar/) that shows when TIaaS trainings are booked
- [some Statistics](https://usegalaxy.eu/tiaas/stats/) about the TIaaS events

Enjoy!
