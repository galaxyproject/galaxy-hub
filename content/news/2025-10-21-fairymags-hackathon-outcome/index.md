# 🧬 Introduction

The biological world as we know it is largely composed of *dark matter* — microorganisms that cannot yet be cultivated in the laboratory. Modern sequencing technologies and bioinformatics tools now allow us to explore this hidden world by generating **metagenome-assembled genomes (MAGs)**. This remains a challenging endeavor, and every bit of collaboration helps to deepen our understanding of these uncultured organisms.

From **October 6–9, 2025**, the [**FAIRyMAGs project**](https://elixir-europe.org/how-we-work/scientific-programme/commissioned-services/science/bfsp/fairymags) (funded by [ELIXIR](https://elixir-europe.org/)) organized a hybrid, four-day hackathon as part of the [**ELIXIR BFSP Programme**](https://elixir-europe.org/internal-projects/commissioned-services/science/biodiversity-foodsecurity-pathogens).
The event openly invited the MAGs community to collaborate on:

* Improving MAGs workflows
* Developing training materials
* Performing benchmarking
* Creating tools for computational resource estimation

A total of **35 researchers from around the world** participated — eight gathering in **Freiburg (Germany)** and five in an **Australian Outpost** (coordinated by **Tiff Nelson**), while the rest joined remotely.

Preparation included a shared Google Docs, spreadsheets, and slides for coordination. During the hackathon, participants joined **joint sessions** between Australia and Europe in the mornings and **Europe-focused working groups** in the afternoons. Communication flowed via a **dedicated Slack channel** in the Galaxy Training Network (GTN).

# 📊 Advancing Workflow Evaluation & Benchmarking

Using **CAMI infrastructure and real datasets**, the group worked to standardize benchmarking for MAG workflows.

## Benchmarking Progress

* Agreed datasets:

  * **CAMI II plant-associated** dataset → [Dataset link](https://frl.publisso.de/data/frl:6425521/plant_associated/)
  * **Loman Lab Mock Community Experiments** → [Mock dataset](https://lomanlab.github.io/mockcommunity/)
* **MGnify**, **nf-core/mag**, and **Galaxy** teams aligned on common benchmarking datasets.
* Planned reach out to **MAGNETO** developers.
* Improved **visualizations for CAMI II benchmarks** using *amber* → [Issue #66](https://github.com/usegalaxy-eu/FAIRyMAGs/issues/66)
* Added **amber CAMI workflow** to IWC → [PR #924](https://github.com/galaxyproject/iwc/pull/924)

## Use Cases

* **Marine MAGs exploration** — first mid-quality MAGs identified via the fallback workflow (figure forthcoming 🌊).

# ⚙️ Building Smarter Resource Estimation Tools

* Collected **binning tool performance data** from MGnify → [PR #75](https://github.com/usegalaxy-eu/FAIRyMAGs/pull/75)
* Evaluated **correlation between sample metadata and memory usage** → [PR #68](https://github.com/usegalaxy-eu/FAIRyMAGs/pull/68)

<div align="center">

  <p><em>Correlation between sample metadata and memory usage</em></p>
</div>

A key challenge identified:

> Galaxy cannot yet use workflow-generated parameters for dynamic resource assignment.
> This limits automatic resource prediction, but **workarounds and future solutions** are under discussion with Galaxy core developers.

# 💬 Summary and Outlook

The **FAIRyMAGs hackathon** brought together a great community of MAGs scientists. And although the hackathon was slightly Galaxy-centric, a nice exchange beyond workflow engines could be establised, targeting major MAGs issues together !

To continue this exchange, we created a dedicated community Slack channel for MAGs workflows, which will be used to continue the discussions, and openly invites anyone working on MAGs. The Slack channel is part of the [microbioinfo](https://microbial-bioinfo.slack.com) workspace. If you want to join, contact us and we will send an invite!
