The COVID-19 pandemic at the beginning of 2020 forced us to rethink and restructure our training offerings to do more remote training. We aimed for a scalable, flexible and open-for-all workshop experience. 

The developed concept was first tried during the [Machine Learning using Galaxy workshop](https://elixir-europe.org/events/machine-learning-using-galaxy-webinar-workshop-series){:target="_blank"}, which was held online from the 22nd to the 26th of June 2020 in collaboration with ELIXIR and de.NBI, with more than 400 students registered. 

The structure of the training combined webinars -introducing basic concepts and methods- and self-study sessions in which the attendees could follow the tutorials themselves and ask questions in case they needed help. 

Based on our experience and the feedback received we have gathered the [lessons learned](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1_sQocj98DxhgnyvtXbRvcXlV84T_I3K1rFmWrMuw6x0/preview#){:target="_blank"} together with a description of the methodology applied.

Thanks to all the participants and trainers!
