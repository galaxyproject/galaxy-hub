The [April 2025](https://cms.aquainfra.eu/files/AquaINFRA%20Newsletter%20April%202025%20V1.0.pdf) issue of [AquaINFRA](https://aquainfra.eu/)'s 
newsletter provided an overview of the goals, objectives, and accomplishments 
of this project, which has been funded by the European Open Science Cloud 
([EOSC](https://eosc.eu)) initiative. Enhancing collaboration and FAIRness within 
the aquatic research community is one of the aims of the AquaINFRA project. 
They are going to link marine and freshwater researchers from all around the 
world and make resources and data sharing easier.  Co-designing and developing 
EOSC-compliant services to increase the FAIRness of freshwater and marine research 
data is one of AquaINFRA's goals.  Among these services are the Virtual Research 
Environment (VRE), the AquaINFRA Data Discovery and Access Service (DDAS), and 
the AquaINFRA Interaction Platform (AIP).

They explained the reasons they had for choosing Galaxy as the platform to 
create their Virtual Research Environment (VRE) in a 
[blog post](https://blog.52north.org/2024/07/25/the-aquainfra-virtual-research-environment-design-rationale-for-using-the-galaxy-platform/). 
To put it briefly, different tools are available, data import and exporting is 
simple (you can see examples of AquaINFRA and Galaxy integration 
[here](https://youtu.be/92VtJhJZA_Q?feature=shared) and 
[here](https://youtu.be/roDOc1qkJdc?feature=shared)), workflow creation is 
straightforward, and results and workflows can be deposited to repositories 
like [Zenodo](https://zenodo.org/) and get a Digital Object Identifier 
(DOI) for them.  To limit the tools available to a subset that are useful 
for freshwater and marine researchers, they will create a subdomain based 
on the successful examples of the [Climate](https://climate.usegalaxy.eu/) 
and [Earth system](https://earth-system.usegalaxy.eu/) communities.  Please
