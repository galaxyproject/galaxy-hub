- On the last day, Björn gave an admin training with Enis Afgan and Bérénice a metagenomic training.

These 3 days were quite intense with a lot of talks and interesting discussions and feedbacks. It was a great opportunity to meet the growing community in Africa (44 participants, 7 countries, 12 institutions) and talk about Galaxy and accessible, reproducible analysis of biological data.
