# Changes to Code Of Conduct committee
Change in membership - Michelle Savage added, Beatriz Serrano-Solano removed (see below)

# Changes to Code Of Conduct
Change in procedure for updates to CoC - CoC Committee members are now listed as codeowners of the file, ensuring that we are aware of any requested changes, and preventing committee members from changing things without review. Review and update window will be held annually starting at GCC each year at a Bird of a Feather event (co-responding async document will be available for members who are not attending GCC in person).  The proposed changes will be shared in the Hub and we will solicit feedback for up to two months. Afterwards, the CoC will vote on the proposed changes and inputs, and ask the Exec Board to ratify our changes. Following the changes, we will publish the updates to the CoC, any incidents that took place and their outcome, and the minutes from Code of Conduct meetings.  


# Code Of Conduct Committee Meeting Minutes
The Code of Conduct Committee met this year on April 12th and October 11th. 

The members present at the April 12th meeting were: <br />
 - Beatriz Serrano-Solano
 - Ross Lazarus
 - Helena Rasche
 - Frederik Coppens

At the April 12th meeting, the team established procedures for how the CoC Committee will conduct business. Topics covered included choosing a chair for each meeting, representation at the BioConductor CoC committee, publishing cases in an annual report, and planning for future meetings.


The members present at the October 11th meeting were:
 - Beatriz Serrano-Solano
 - Ross Lazarus
 - Helena Rasche
 - Frederik Coppens
 - Assunta DeSanto

At the October 11th meeting, the team discussed future interactions with the Bioconductor CoC committee, membership in the CoC Committee, and the procedure to edit the CoC in the future. Michelle Savage will be joining the CoC Committee in order to maintain quorum, as Beatriz Serrano-Solano is sadly leaving the organisation. Michelle will also be the Ombudsperson for BioConductor.  While Michelle was added partially due to the emergency circumstances of losing a member, the procedure for new members will be formalised going forward, and applied whenever we fall below the quorum due to departure, and evaluated as needed at the yearly CoC review meeting. The main topic of this meeting was how to establish procedures for reviewing and updating the Code of Conduct, motivated by community members expressing a desire for updates. These procedures are detailed above.
