## **Galaxy and Bioconductor Community Conference 2025 (GBCC2025)**

![GBCC2025](GBCC2025.png)

Mark your calendars for June 23-26, 2025! We are excited to announce the first-ever Galaxy and Bioconductor Community Conference (GBCC 2025), taking place at the iconic Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory in New York. This event will unite the Galaxy and Bioconductor communities for an unprecedented collaboration aimed at advancing bioinformatics and data science tools across both platforms. 

**What to expect:**

* **Cutting-Edge Keynotes:** Hear from leaders in both the Galaxy and Bioconductor communities about the latest innovations in genomics and data science.  
* **Hands-On Tutorials:** Gain practical experience integrating Bioconductor tools with Galaxy during interactive workshops and tutorials.  
* **Networking and Collaboration:** Connect with peers during poster sessions, social events, and group activities. GBCC 2025 is designed to spark long-term collaborations between both communities.  
* **Diversity and Inclusion:** Scholarships, support for underrepresented groups, and resources for those with childcare needs will ensure an inclusive and welcoming environment for all attendees.

**Why plan to join?**

By attending GBCC 2025, you’ll be joining the forefront of bioinformatics and data science innovation. This is your chance to collaborate with global experts, contribute to discussions on reproducibility and open science, and learn how to leverage the combined power of Galaxy and Bioconductor to advance your research. 

**Logo design contest**

Get creative! We’re kicking off a GBCC 2025 logo design contest, and we want you to design the official logo. The winning design will be featured on all conference materials—think t-shirts, stickers, and more! Stay tuned for contest details.

## **Welcoming ColabFold to Galaxy!**

We are thrilled to announce that ColabFold, the powerful tool combining MMseqs2 with AlphaFold2 or RoseTTAFold for ultra-fast protein structure prediction, is now fully available on UseGalaxy.org! This exciting addition allows users to effortlessly predict protein structures and complexes in a fraction of the time, harnessing the speed of MMseqs2 and the accuracy of AlphaFold2—all within the familiar Galaxy environment. 

What makes this even better? The Galaxy version of ColabFold has streamlined the process by splitting it into two steps: the MSA (Multiple Sequence Alignment) step and the AlphaFold2 step. Each step runs quickly, with individual sequences completing in seconds or minutes. This unique two-part design also lets you take an iterative approach, refining your results at each step—a feature we know you’ll love!

Plus, with ColabFold running entirely on Galaxy servers, users worldwide now have more capacity than ever to analyze protein structures—no more waiting on limited resources! This is a game-changer for researchers who have been eagerly awaiting this tool.

Interested? Please keep in mind a few key details:

* Galaxy users can run up to two MSA jobs and four AlphaFold2 jobs concurrently.  
* The MSA tool accepts up to 20 sequences per FASTA/a3m file.  
* AlphaFold2 jobs are shared across users, so some wait time may occur. Be sure to leave your jobs queued until completion. In the meantime, other Galaxy jobs can still run!

We’d like to give a huge shout-out to the Advanced Research Computing team at Johns Hopkins for supporting the MSA step and to the Frontera project at the Texas Advanced Computing Center for providing the GPU power behind AlphaFold2. Special thanks to Milot Mirdita, developer of ColabFold, and our supporters at NHGRI and NSF for making this possible.

For more information on ColabFold, check out the [GitHub repository](https://github.com/sokrypton/ColabFold) and read the [original publication](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41592-022-01488-1), which explains how it all works.

Get started today on UseGalaxy.org, and happy folding!
