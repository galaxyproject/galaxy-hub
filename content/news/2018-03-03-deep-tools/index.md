The deepTools developers have released a brand new version! This time with CRAM support, new normalization and plotting
options, new tools, e.g. alignmentsieve for ATAC-seq, and [many more](https://github.com/deeptools/deepTools/blob/master/CHANGES.txt
).

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-lang="de"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">deepTools 3.0 is now available on pypi (bioconda soon). Changes include a completely revamped normalization interface (and new methods), CRAM support, interactive plots,  a more homogenized interface, new tools and better MultiQC integration</p>&mdash; Devon Ryan (@dpryan79) <a href="https://twitter.com/dpryan79/status/963061179311632384?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">12.

Special thanks to Devon and Fidel for those fantastic tools that were executed over 50.000 times so far on our Galaxy server.
