tease: As we orbit the end of another stellar year, let’s engage warp drive and reflect on the out-of-this-world achievements of the **Single-cell & sPatial Omics Community (SPOC 🖖). From launching new tools to charting new tutorials, SPOC’s journey through the Galaxy (platform) has been nothing short of cosmic! 🌠
title: 🚀 2024: A SPOC-tacular Year in Review 🌌

🌌 Looking to the Horizon
As SPOC’s starship accelerates toward 2025, we’ll continue to explore new omics territories and deepen our cosmic connections across the Galaxy. Thank you to every SPOC cadet, captain, and commander who contributed this year—you’ve made SPOC the brightest star in the bioinformatics universe!

Keep reaching for the stars, SPOC-nauts! 🪐✨
