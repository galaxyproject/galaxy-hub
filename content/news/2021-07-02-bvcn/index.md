The [Bioinformatics Virtual Coordination Network (BVCN)](https://biovcnet.github.io/) is committed to reducing entry barriers into bioinformatics for researchers. For the first time in June 2021, this online conference brought together early career researchers (ECRs) from across the globe who are equally committed to reducing such entry barriers, and who would like to exchange and share their research and bioinformatics experiences in a step-by-step format with a global and interdisciplinary audience.

The first conference of BVCN was [**Holistic Bioinformatic Approaches used in Microbiome Research**](https://biovcnet.github.io/_pages/conference-2021/), A step-by-step open access conference showcasing state-of-the-art bioinformatics pipelines for microbiome research. It was run 7-11 June 2021, online.
