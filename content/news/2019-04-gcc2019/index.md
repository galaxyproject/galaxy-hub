As you probably know GCC2019 will be held in Freiburg, Germany, from 1-6 July. Like [previous Galaxy Community Conferences](https://galaxyproject.org/gcc/), GCC2019 will [feature](https://gcc2019.sched.com) keynotes, accepted talks, posters, and demos, birds-of-a-feather gatherings, multiple days of collaborative work, and plenty of opportunities to network with your fellow data-intensive researchers and practitioners. If you are working in data-intensive life science, there is no better place to be.

GCC2019 will feature more training sessions than ever and has the goal to bring together all different communities that make the Galaxy universe such a great place. We will start on Monday the 1st of July with a warm up training day and get everyone started with an introduction into Galaxy both from a user-point of view and an Admin point of view.
Tuesday, Wednesday and Thursday are 3 days of conference, featuring 2 parallel tracks on each day. We will have [6 tracks](https://gcc2019.sched.com), dedicated to 6 different communities:

* Epigenetics
* Proteomics and Metabolomics
* Administration and Galaxy Development
* Metagenomics and Assembly
* Transcriptomics & Genome Variation
* Diverse community (Imaging, Natural Language Processing, Ecology ...)

Every track will feature keynotes from Galaxy users, talks, lightning talks and two trainings dedicated to each specific track. We encourage everyone to learn from other communities and get inspiration about what is possible these days and how to boost your data analysis.

[Registration](https://galaxyproject.org/events/gcc2019/registration/) and [abstract submission](https://galaxyproject.org/events/gcc2019/abstracts/) are open. We would love to hear user stories and what gives everyone the stage to present all the great work the community has created during the last year. Join us in [Freiburg](https://galaxyproject.org/events/gcc2019/#location)!
