[Heinz](https://github.com/ls-cwi/heinz) is an algorithm for searching an optimal subnetwork from a bigger network. It can be applied to biological networks like gene regulation and protein-protein network to pinpoint the subnetwork of interest. We are pleased to announce that Heinz tools have been integrated into the Galaxy platform and are available on [our server](https://usegalaxy.eu/?tool_id=toolshed.g2.bx.psu.edu%2Frepos%2Fiuc%2Fheinz%2Fheinz_scoring){:target="_blank"}.

At the same time, the training material for Heinz is also ready in Galaxy training network: [Slides](https://galaxyproject.github.io/training-material/topics/transcriptomics/tutorials/network-analysis-with-heinz/slides.html) and [Tutorial](https://galaxyproject.github.io/training-material/topics/transcriptomics/tutorials/network-analysis-with-heinz/tutorial.html), which can be used for self-learning or teaching purposes.
