# JTech, the James Taylor Foundation

</div>

The recent passing of [Dr. James Taylor](/jxtx/), the Ralph S. O’Connor Professor of Biology and Professor of Computer Science at Johns Hopkins University, has left an enormous void in the field of computational biology. To help fill this void and continue James’ efforts, the Galaxy community has established a memorial foundation in James’ name.

James believed that scientific progress can best be sustained through mentoring of students and junior faculty. The Junior Training and Educational Connections Hotspot (JTech) foundation will ensure implementation of this vision. To begin, JTech will  (1) support  graduate students to participate in computational biology and data science conferences, and (2) organize and host mentoring sessions between senior and junior faculty members at high-profile meetings. JTech will later expand its reach as a platform for academic mentorship including high school through college age students.

To make this happen we are [accepting contributions here](https://galaxyproject.org/jxtx/). Please, help us continue what James has started.

<div class="card-header">Webinar: Using the new Galaxy-SRA Connector</div>

Galaxy and the NIH Sequence Read Archive are now directly connected, enabling researchers to work with SRA data available from NCBI (https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/sra/) more easily within the Galaxy framework. This webinar will talk about the connection and demonstrate how to use it to get SRA data into Galaxy.

[NIH's Sequence Read Archive (SRA)](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/sra) will become an integrated data source on [UseGalaxy.org](https://usegalaxy.org) this month. This functionality is also built in to the upcoming 20.05 release of Galaxy. With this connection, you will be able to work with SRA data available from NCBI more easily within the Galaxy framework.

A [webinar on June 24](/events/2020-06-sra/) will demonstrate this integration and how to use SRA data in the Galaxy platform.  The webinar will be held on June 24, at Noon, Eastern US time (GMT -4).  Interested?  **[Register now](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSfeAjnJSEfG11ngNn_sS3imPiXuHhdUcDSaBO6u__88xRnMbA/viewform).**
