[ELIXIR Belgium](https://www.elixir-belgium.org/), in collaboration with the European Galaxy project (de.NBI) and the [European COVID-19 Data Platform](https://www.covid19dataportal.org/), have developed a tool to simplify the submission of viral sequencing data to the [European Nucleotide Archive (ENA)](https://www.ebi.ac.uk/ena/browser/home), an ELIXIR Core Data Resource providing open access to nucleotide sequences. The new submission tool offers an easy-to-use interface, guides researchers through the submission process and verifies the data format and description.
