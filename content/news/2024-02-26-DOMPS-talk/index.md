**Deepti Varshney** and **Saskia Hiltemann** presented a talk entitled **"MAdLand Resources & Tools"** at the Plant Science Seminar organised by the [Department of Molecular Plant Sciences (DOMPS)](http://www.plantphotobiology.org/DOMPS/Plant_Science_Seminar.php), Institute of Biology II/III, University of Freiburg on February 26, 2024. [MAdLand](https://madland.science/) is a DFG-funded research consortium exploring the molecular mechanism behind the transition from water to land, from alga to land plant. All work presented in that presentation is part of a collaboration between  MAdLand, NFDI4Plants (DATAplant), Galaxy & de.NBI. In their presentation, they focused on several cutting-edge resources useful for research: MAdLandDB (GenomeZoo), Galaxy, TAPscan v4, and DataPLANT ARCs.


Galaxy is a widely used open-source platform that empowers scientists globally and enhances research accessibility, reproducibility, and transparency. [Galaxy Training Network (GTN)](https://training.galaxyproject.org/) employs a collaborative, open, and FAIR approach to scientific training materials. With over 300 tutorials authored and reviewed by a global community, the GTN serves researchers, educators, and scientific tool developers.

MAdLandDB offers a comprehensive protein database accessible via Galaxy, focusing on non-seed plants and streptophyte algae. It provides reliable genome sequences for comparative plant biology research.

TAPscan v4 is an advanced tool for genome-wide annotation of plant transcription-associated proteins (TAPs). TAPs (TFs and TRs) are key to understanding the development and evolution of plant form and function. Access to reliable, up-to-date classifications of TAPs enables comparative analyses that expand our knowledge of plant transcriptional regulation. 

DataPLANT contributes to the creation of ARCs, store large amounts of annotated research data, as a means to make data and metadata available to and reusable by the community.

The talk was well-received and sparked a brief discussion about the utilization of MAdLandDB, Galaxy, and ARC.
