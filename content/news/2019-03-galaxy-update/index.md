# GCC2019 Sponsors

We are very pleased to announce that **[eLife](https://elifesciences.org/)** and **[F1000Research](https://f1000research.com/)** are first two [sponsors for GCC2019](/events/gcc2019/sponsors/). *And they are both sponsoring childcare.*  **Yes, there will be childcare at GCC2019!**

## eLife

[<img class="float-right img-fluid mx-auto" style="max-width: 240px" src="/images/logos/elife-logo-wide.jpg" alt="eLife" />](https://elifesciences.org/)

***[eLife](https://elifesciences.org/)*** is a non-profit open access journal, publishing research from across the life and biomedical sciences. We also invest heavily in software development, new product design, collaboration and outreach. This includes the development of open-source tools, with extensible capabilities, that can be used, adopted and modified by any interested party to help move towards an ecosystem that serves science and scientists as efficiently and as cost-effectively as possible.

Have you got an idea that will bring cutting-edge technology to open research communication? We are here to help.

eLife’s **Innovation Initiative** was set up to identify and support innovative, small-to-medium-scale open-source projects aiming to improve the sharing and reuse of scientific discoveries. The primary outputs of the Initiative are open tools, technologies and processes aimed at improving the discovery, sharing, consumption and evaluation of important scientific research.

Through this Initiative, we’re always on the lookout for opportunities to engage with the best emerging talent and ideas at the interface of research and technology. You can find out more about some of these engagements [on eLife Labs](https://elifesciences.org/labs), or contact our Innovation Community Manager for more information (innovation@elifesciences.org).

## The Galaxy Gateway on F1000Research

[<img class="float-right img-fluid mx-auto" style="max-width: 200px" src="/images/logos/f1000-logo-wide.png" alt="F1000Research: Open for Science" />](https://f1000research.com/)

[F1000Research](https://f1000research.com/) is proud this year to be sponsoring childcare for GCC2019, which we feel is vital for inclusivity. F1000Research is an Open Access publishing platform for the life sciences that publishes a range of different article types, from traditional research articles, to method articles and software tools. The platform is particularly well suited to publishing software tool articles as our versioning system allows small updates at any time, we have proper syntax highlighting and we can support LaTeX and markdown submissions.

Our [Galaxy Gateway](https://f1000research.com/gateways/galaxy) on the platform brings together articles, posters and slides from Galaxy events. The Gateway allows authors to quickly share their work with the community, boosting visibility and giving researchers proper credit for their contribution.

We’re pleased to be running a call for papers for GCC2019 and **would like to invite the Galaxy community to submit their articles to the [Galaxy Gateway](https://f1000research.com/gateways/galaxy) by 20<sup>th</sup> July 2019.** These can be any type of article, such as a new Galaxy workflow or an update to an existing method or software tool. This is a great opportunity to shine a light on your research, improve its impact and be credited with an academic paper for your work. Please submit via the Galaxy gateway and if you have any questions at all do not hesitate to get in touch at publishers@f1000.com.

## Your Organization/Vendor Here!

[GCC2019](/events/gcc2019/) is looking for [sponsors](/events/gcc2019/sponsors/)!  If your organization wants to help put on the premier Galaxy event of the year, then please contact the [organizers](/events/gcc2019/sponsors/)). And please encourage your vendors to consider sponsoring as well.  Sponsors are potential partners for participants and their contributions make GCC affordable (and maybe even possible).

</div>

After a two year hiatus, the [online GalaxyAdmins meetups](/community/galaxy-admins/meetups/) will return on [March 21](/community/galaxy-admins/meetups/2019-03-21/), with a community discussion, and a presentation from [Pablo Moreno](/news/2018-08-cotm-pablo-moreno/) on *Running Galaxy on Kubernetes*, online at 15:00 GMT (see [your local time](https://www.timeanddate.com/worldclock/fixedtime.html?msg=March+2019+GalaxyAdmins+Meetup&iso=20190321T15&p1=1234&ah=1)).  See the [meetup page for links](/community/galaxy-admins/meetups/)).

[GalaxyAdmins](/community/galaxy-admins/) is a discussion group for Galaxy community members who are responsible for Galaxy installations. Our online meetups are around an hour long and feature a presentation followed by an open discussion.  It's a great place to catch up on what your fellow admins are thinking about.

## Publication Topics

### New Tag: Education

We added a new tag to the [Galaxy Publication Library](/publication-library/) this month: *[Education](https://www.zotero.org/groups/1732893/galaxy/tags/%2BEducation)*.  This tag highlights papers that focus on training, teaching, and/or education in general.  Galaxy is well suited for teaching bioinformatics and this has been reflected in publications for several years.  There are three new pubs this month about education. We also selectively back-curated several papers.  *Education* is the first new tag added to the library in six years.

# Galaxy Platforms News

The [Galaxy Platform Directory](/use/) lists resources for easily running your analysis on Galaxy, including publicly available servers, cloud services, and containers and VMs that run Galaxy.  A lot was added in February:

## FreeBioInfo

[<img class="float-left" style="max-width: 400px" src="/use/freebioinfo/freebioinfologo.jpg" alt="FreeBioInfo" />](/use/freebioinfo/)

[FreeBioinfo](http://www.freebioinfo.org/) is a public server for metagenomic analysis.  The server supports a wide range of metagenomics and other tools. Ther is a [Cookbook](http://www.freebioinfo.org/galaxy/static/protocol/galaxyhelphuixiuli20170425.pdf) for the site (although it is in Chinese). FreeBioInfo is hosted at the [China Agricultural University](https://cau.edu.cn/), in Beijing, China.

[<img class="float-right" style="max-width: 300px" src="/use/gcac/gcac-landing.png" alt="GCAC" />](/use/gcac/)

## GCAC

[GCAC : Galaxy for Compound Activity Classification](https://github.com/LynnLab-JNU/gcac-galaxy-tools) is available as a [public server](http://ccbb.jnu.ac.in/gcac), as a [virtual machine](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1ZQM5x-9J49rvPy9SoWOrM3Xm1MHZdr1I/view?usp=sharing), and as a [tool suite in the Galaxy Toolshed](https://toolshed.g2.bx.psu.edu/repository?repository_id=351af44ceb587e54). GCAC is a web enabled paltform for predictive model building using R and caret package for virtual screening.

GCAC is supported by [Jawaharlal Nehru University](https://www.jnu.ac.in/main/).

## EWAS-Galaxy

[EWAS-Galaxy](https://github.com/kpbioteam/docker_ewas) is a Docker image for population epigenetics data analysis. Epigenome-wide association studies (EWAS) analyse genome-wide activity of epigenetic marks in cohorts of different individuals to find associations between epigenetic variation and phenotype. EWAS-Galaxy is supported by the [University of Bradford](https://bradford.ac.uk/external/).

[<img class="float-right" style="max-width: 300px" src="/use/mandoiu/mandoiu-landing-500.png" alt="Mandoiu Lab" />](/use/mandoiu/)

## Mandoiu Lab

The [Mandoiu Lab Galaxy server](https://neo.engr.uconn.edu/) is a customized installation of the Galaxy framework deploying bioinformatic tools and pipelines developed in the [Mandoiu Lab](http://dna.engr.uconn.edu/) at the [University of Connecticut](http://www.uconn.edu/) for high-throughput sequencing and immunogenomics data analysis.  Source code and relevant publications for these and other tools developed in the lab are available on the [Mandoiu lab software page](https://dna.engr.uconn.edu/?page_id=40).  

## DocMethyl

[DocMethyl EpiMOLAS](https://hub.docker.com/r/lsbnb/docmethyl) is Docker image  for DNA methylation analysis in WGBS. This Galaxy docker container have tested with demo dataset under the Ubuntu 16.04 64 bit system equipped with four-core CPU, 32GB RAM, 400GB storage.  The image is maintained by the [Institute of Information Science, Academia Sinica](http://eln.iis.sinica.edu.tw), in Taipei, Taiwan.

## Trinity

<img class="float-left" style="max-width: 300px" src="/use/archive/trinity-ctat/trinity-pti-logo.jpg" alt="Trinity CTAT" />

[Trinity CTAT Galaxy](https://galaxy.ncgas-trinity.indiana.edu/) is a [public server](https://galaxy.ncgas-trinity.indiana.edu/) and [Docker container](https://github.com/NCIP/Trinity_CTAT_galaxy/wiki/Intro) providing users with access to large memory resources required for *de novo* transcriptome assembly and downstream analysis.  Funded by the National Cancer Institute, the Trinity Cancer Transcriptome Analysis Toolkit provides a suite of software for the analysis of cancer transcriptome data. The nature of cancer data requires different assumptions and approaches to analysis, above and beyond the normal challenges of dealing with RNA-seq. View [more information on the tools available here](https://github.com/NCIP/Trinity_CTAT/wiki). The resource has slides available for tasks such as moving data, and help can be reached at trinity@ncgas.org. There are no quotas, however, there is an aggressive purge policy for the disk usage.
