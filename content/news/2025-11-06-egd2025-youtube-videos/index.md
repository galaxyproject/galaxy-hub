The videos feature contributions from Galaxy admins, tool and workflow developers, domain experts, and infrastructure projects, showcasing how the Galaxy ecosystem is tackling challenges across research domains and infrastructures.

Highlights include (among others):

- Updates on the Galaxy platform, governance, and community efforts
- Use cases from microbiology, imaging, ecology, materials science, clinical and biomedical research
- Talks on training, sustainability, FAIR workflows, and long-term infrastructure
- [EuroScienceGateway](https://galaxyproject.org/projects/esg/) results, building blocks, and collaborations shaped around Galaxy

Due to technical and logistical constraints, not all talks could be recorded. Where a recording is missing, you can still explore the corresponding slides linked from the main EGD2025 event report.
