The single-cell materials in the Galaxy Training Network (GTN) have [once again expanded](https://training.galaxyproject.org/training-material/search?query=single-cell), with welcome contributions from [Cristobal Gallardo](https://training.galaxyproject.org/training-material/hall-of-fame/gallardoalba/) and [Mehmet Tekman](https://training.galaxyproject.org/training-material/hall-of-fame/mtekman/) of the Freiburg Galaxy Team, and [Wendi Bacon](https://training.galaxyproject.org/training-material/hall-of-fame/nomadscientist/) of the EMBL European Bioinformatics Institute (EMBL-EBI). The new tutorials focus on [multiple sample analysis](https://training.galaxyproject.org/training-material/topics/transcriptomics/tutorials/scrna-seq-basic-pipeline/tutorial.html) and [plant datasets](https://training.galaxyproject.org/training-material/topics/transcriptomics/tutorials/scrna-plant/tutorial.html), both using the new version (1.7) of the fantastic ScanPy tool suite and the [Jupyter Notebooks](https://training.galaxyproject.org/training-material/topics/transcriptomics/tutorials/scrna-JUPYTER-trajectories/tutorial.html) hosted on Galaxy.

The GTN materials paired with the continuously expanding Galaxy online computing platform, freely enable researchers and bio-enthusiasts to develop their understanding of various cutting-edge topics in single-cell. This, in conjunction with the [Single Cell interactive application](https://www.ebi.ac.uk/about/news/announcements/SCiAp) (SCiAp) computation interface, as well as the vast datasets from the [Human Cell Atlas](https://humancellatlas.usegalaxy.eu/) (HCA), provide users with a powerful playground of resources to explore at their hearts content.
