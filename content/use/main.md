This directory lists __platforms where you can use or deploy__ your own Galaxy Server with minimal effort. Covering a wide spectrum, there are resources for genomics, metagenomics, transcriptomics, proteomics, and drug discovery. Also, there are even some outside biology like natural language processing (a couple of them) and social science.

* *Almost all of them are free to use (Commercial clouds are the exception).*
* *Almost all of them are open to everyone (Academic clouds are the exception).*
* *All of the resources can be used, either immediately, or shortly after getting an account.*
