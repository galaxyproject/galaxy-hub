Once marked as deleted the datasets will be permanently removed within 14 days. If the user *purges* the dataset in the Galaxy, it will be removed immediately, permanently. An extended quota can be [requested](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSf9w2MOS6KOlu9XdhRSDqWnCDkzoVBqHJ3zH_My4p8D8ZgkIQ/viewform) for a limited time period in special cases."

This cookie is not used for any other purposes (e.g. tracking or analytics.) If UseGalaxy.eu service is not accessed for 90 days, those datasets will be permanently deleted."
