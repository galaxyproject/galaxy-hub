Public Servers are accessible to (at least) any academic researcher in the world.  Some require you to create/request an account, and they may have restrictive quotas, but often, to use these, just go to the website and start running analyses. These are free to use.

The folks are Freiburg have put together a [public Galaxy server dashboard](https://stats.galaxyproject.eu/d/000000020/public-galaxy-servers?orgId=1) to track the status and some of the supported features of the servers listed here. See the [blog post](/news/2017-10-public-galaxy-dashboard/) for more info.
