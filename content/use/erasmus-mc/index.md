comments:
  - "This server supports a wealth of RNA-Seq tasks, including: quantify gene expression (featureCounts, edgeR, experimental design module) determine and prioritize fusion genes (star-fusion, Fuma, ifuse) determine variants and annotate small variants (BAM to varscan2, Annovar) detect small ncRNA derived RNAs in small RNA-seq alignments (Flaimapper) Generate html user defined workflow (iReport) All tools are also available in the Tool Shed."
