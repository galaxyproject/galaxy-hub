## Galaxy Workshop Tokyo, April 28

<div class='left'>
<a href='/events/tokyo2015/'><img src="/events/tokyo2015/WST2015.png" alt="" width="170" /></a>
</div>

The [Galaxy Workshop Tokyo 2015](/events/tokyo2015/) is a full day of hands-on training, keynotes, lightning talks and discussions all about ways of using Galaxy for high-throughput biology, specially for human genome sequencing. This workshop will consist of two parts: The morning session is a hands-on training to learn how to run [Pitagora-Galaxy](http://www.pitagora-galaxy.org/about_en), our *Galaxy preconfigured virtual machine*, on your laptop or on AWS cloud. The afternoon session includes keynotes and lightning sessions to explain actual workflows, which *you can try immediately* on Pitagora-Galaxy.<br /><br />

## GCC2015: 6-8 July, Norwich UK

<div class='right'><a href='http://gcc2015.tsl.ac.uk/'><img src="/images/logos/GCC2015LogoWide600.png" alt="Sponsor GCC2015" width="170" /></a></div>

The [2015 Galaxy Community Conference (GCC2015)](http://gcc2015.tsl.ac.uk/) is the Galaxy community's annual gathering of users, developers, and administrators.  [Previous GCC's](/events/gcc2014/) have drawn over 200 participants, and we expect that to happen again in 2015.  GCC2015 is being hosted by [The Sainsbury Lab](http://tsl.ac.uk/) in Norwich, UK, immediately before [BOSC](http://www.open-bio.org/wiki/BOSC_2015) and [ISMB/ECCB](http://www.iscb.org/ismbeccb2015) in Dublin.

There are a lot of events going on at GCC2015, including:

* [Code Hackathon](/galaxy-updates/2015-04/#code-hackathon), 4-5 July
* [Data Wrangling Hackathon](/galaxy-updates/2015-04/#data-wrangling-hackathon), 4-5 July (*new*)
* [Training SunDay](/galaxy-updates/2015-04/#training-sunday), 5 July (*new*)
* [Training Day](/galaxy-updates/2015-04/#training-monday), 6 July
* [GCC Meeting](/galaxy-updates/2015-04/#abstract-submission-is-now-open), 7-8 July

### Code Hackathon

An [intense two-day hands-on collaboration](http://gcc2015.tsl.ac.uk/Hackathon) to *develop working code that is useful to the Galaxy community*. If you know how to code, and want to contribute to one of the most successful open source projects in the life sciences, then please consider attending. See the [Code Hackathon](http://gcc2015.tsl.ac.uk/Hackathon) home page for more.

### Data Wrangling Hackathon

An [intense two-day hands-on collaboration](http://gcc2015.tsl.ac.uk/Data-Hackathon) to *develop cutting edge analysis pipelines that are useful to the Galaxy community*. If you know data analysis, we would love to have you here to help us beat back those seemingly unsurmountable analysis challenges. See the [Data Wrangling Hackathon home page](http://gcc2015.tsl.ac.uk/Data-Hackathon) for more.

### Training SunDay

Something new for GCC2015 is *[Training SunDay](http://gcc2015.tsl.ac.uk/training-day/)*, an additional day of training offered the day before its older sibling [Training Day](http://gcc2015.tsl.ac.uk/training-day/), and featuring a single track with the most in-demand topics. You can attend both Training Days, or just one.  Training SunDay features these three topics:

* [Introduction to Galaxy](http://gcc2015.tsl.ac.uk/training-day/#Introduction_to_Galaxy)
* [RNA-Seq Analysis with Galaxy](http://gcc2015.tsl.ac.uk/training-day/#RNA-Seq_Analysis_with_Galaxy)
* [Visualisation of NGS Data](http://gcc2015.tsl.ac.uk/training-day/#Visualisation_of_NGS_Data)

These three topics are also offered on Monday as well.  You can register for one or both Training Days.

<div class='right'><br /><a href='http://gcc2015.tsl.ac.uk/training-day/'><img src="/images/logos/GCC2015_TrainingDay128.png" alt="Training Day Schedules set" width="100" /></a>
</div>

### Training (Mon)Day

The schedule for [Training Day, Monday, 6 July is available](http://gcc2015.tsl.ac.uk/training-day/). Training Day featuring five parallel tracks, each with three, two and a half hour workshops. There are topics on [using Galaxy](http://gcc2015.tsl.ac.uk/training-day/#Using_Galaxy), [interacting with it programmatically](http://gcc2015.tsl.ac.uk/training-day/#Using_Galaxy_Programmatically), and [deploying, administering, and extending Galaxy](http://gcc2015.tsl.ac.uk/training-day/#Deploying_Administering_and_Wrapping_Tools_for_Galaxy). No matter what you do with Galaxy, there are workshops for you.

### Early Registration opens ...

*Early* [registration](http://gcc2015.tsl.ac.uk/abstracts/registration/) (save *heaps)* will open in April, we promise. Early registration is very affordable and starts at less than £40 per day for students and postdocs. If you work in data-intensive life science research, then it is hard find a meeting more relevant than GCC2015.  We look forward to seeing you there.

### Paper Abstract Submission Extended to April 20

[Abstract submission for Oral and Poster Presentations](http://gcc2015.tsl.ac.uk/Abstracts) at the [2015 Galaxy Community Conference (GCC2015)](http://gcc2015.tsl.ac.uk/) is now open.

[Abstract submission](http://gcc2015.tsl.ac.uk/Abstracts) for oral presentations closes ~~10~~ 20 April, while poster submission closes 1 May. Poster authors will be notified of acceptance status within two weeks of submission, while oral presentation authors will be notified no later than 4 May.  *Please consider presenting your work. If you are dealing with big biological data, then this meeting wants to hear about it.*

# ToolShed Contributions

A [best practices for creating Galaxy Tools](/tools/best-practices/) is now available on this wiki.  Thanks to the many contributors who created it.

## Galaxy Project ToolShed Repos

Note: Starting with the May news, this list will be placed on a separate page and linked to from here.  This section is just getting too long (which is the kind of problem we want to have :-).

### Suites

* *From [biomonika](https://toolshed.g2.bx.psu.edu/view/biomonika):*
    * [suite_linkyx_1_0](https://toolshed.g2.bx.psu.edu/view/biomonika/suite_linkyx_1_0): Metapackage for the installation of linkyx suite of tools.

### Tools

* *From [galaxyp](https://toolshed.g2.bx.psu.edu/view/galaxyp):*
    * [ms_wiff_loader](https://toolshed.g2.bx.psu.edu/view/galaxyp/ms_wiff_loader): Loads AB Sciex wiff files from URLs into a Galaxy Wiff Composite dataset
    * [ms_data_converter](https://toolshed.g2.bx.psu.edu/view/galaxyp/ms_data_converter): Converts WIFF format MS data to mzML or MGF using AB SCIEX MS Data Converter

* *From [rnateam](https://toolshed.g2.bx.psu.edu/view/rnateam):*
    * [kinwalker](https://toolshed.g2.bx.psu.edu/view/rnateam/kinwalker): The Kinwalker algorithm performs cotranscriptional folding of RNAs, starting at a user a specified structure (default: open chain) and ending at the minimum free energy structure. Folding events are performed between transcription of additional bases and are regulated by barrier heights between the source and target structure
    * [vienna_rna](https://toolshed.g2.bx.psu.edu/view/rnateam/vienna_rna): The ViennaRNA Package consists of several stand-alone programs for the prediction and comparison of RNA secondary structures.   RNA secondary structure prediction through energy minimization is the most used function in the package. We provide three kinds of dynamic programming algorithms for structure prediction: the minimum free energy algorithm of (Zuker & Stiegler 1981) which yields a single optimal structure, the partition function algorithm of (McCaskill 1990) which calculates base pair probabilities in the thermodynamic ensemble, and the suboptimal folding algorithm of (Wuchty et.al 1999) which generates all suboptimal structures within a given energy range of the optimal energy. For secondary structure comparison, the package contains several measures of distance (dissimilarities) using either string alignment or tree-editing (Shapiro & Zhang 1990). Finally, we provide an algorithm to design sequences with a predefined structure (inverse folding).

* *From [fastaptamer](https://toolshed.g2.bx.psu.edu/view/fastaptamer):*
    * [fastaptamer_cluster](https://toolshed.g2.bx.psu.edu/view/fastaptamer/fastaptamer_cluster): Cluster closely-related sequences using Levenshtein edit distance. FASTAptamer-Cluster uses the Levenshtein algorithm to cluster together closely-related sequences based on a user-defined edit distance (the minimum number of insertions, deletions, or subsitutions required to transform one string into another).

* [fastaptamer_count](https://toolshed.g2.bx.psu.edu/view/fastaptamer/fastaptamer_count): Count, rank, sort and normalize sequence reads in a selection population. FASTAptamer-Count serves as the gateway to the FASTAptamer suite of bioinformatics tools for combinatorial selections (aptamers, (deoxy)ribozymes, phage display, direct mutagenesis, etc.). For a given FASTQ input file, FASTAptamer-Count will determine the number of times each sequence was read, normalize sequence frequency to reads per million, and rank and sort sequences by decreasing total reads.
* [fastaptamer_compare](https://toolshed.g2.bx.psu.edu/view/fastaptamer/fastaptamer_compare): Compare sequence distribution between two populations. FASTAptamer-Compare facilitates statistical analysis of two populations by rapidly generating a tab-delimited output file that lists each unique sequence along with RPM (reads per million) in each population file (if available) and log(2) of the ratio of their RPM values in each population.  RPM data for both populations can be utilized to generate an XY-scatter plot of sequence distribution across two populations.  FASTAptamer-Compare also facilitates the generation of a histogram of the sequence distribution by creating 102 bins for the log(2) values.  This histogram can provide a quick visual comparison of the two populations: distributions centered around 0 indicate similar populations, while distributions shifted to the left or right indicate overall enrichment or depletion.
* [fastaptamer_search](https://toolshed.g2.bx.psu.edu/view/fastaptamer/fastaptamer_search): Degenerate nucleotide motif searching. FASTAptamer-Search searches for degenerate nucleotide motifs within a FASTA file.

* [fastaptamer_enrich](https://toolshed.g2.bx.psu.edu/view/fastaptamer/fastaptamer_enrich): Calculate fold-enrichment of each sequence across populations. FASTAptamer-Enrich rapidly calculates "fold-enrichment" values for each sequence across two or three input files.  Output is provided as a tab-delimited file and is formatted to include sequence composition, length, rank, reads, reads per million (RPM), cluster information (if available) and enrichment values for each sequence.

    * [macs2](https://toolshed.g2.bx.psu.edu/view/iuc/macs2): MACS - Model-based Analysis of ChIP-Seq.  With the improvement of sequencing techniques, chromatin immunoprecipitation followed by high throughput sequencing (ChIP-Seq) is getting popular to study genome-wide protein-DNA interactions. To address the lack of powerful ChIP-Seq analysis method, we present a novel algorithm, named Model-based Analysis of ChIP-Seq (MACS), for identifying transcript factor binding sites. MACS captures the influence of genome complexity to evaluate the significance of enriched ChIP regions, and MACS improves the spatial resolution of binding sites through combining the information of both sequencing tag position and orientation. MACS can be easily used for ChIP-Seq data alone, or with control sample with the increase of specificity.

    * [unafold](https://toolshed.g2.bx.psu.edu/view/hogart/unafold): Galaxy Tool wrapper for UNAFold This is the Galaxy wrapper for the UNAFold (http://mfold.rna.albany.edu/?q=DINAMelt/software). UNAFold software was developed for nucleic acid folding and hybridization prediction (doi: 10.1007/978-1-60327-429-6_1, doi: 10.1093/nar/gki591)

     Note: the UNAFold requires a big amount of RAM - e.g. the folding of 43 kb RNA eats near 30 GB of memory. So, after the installation of this wrapper you will need to modify the job_conf.xml of your Galaxy instance properly. Also, please be sure that zip datatype is registered as binary datatype in your Galaxy instance.

* *From [steffen](https://toolshed.g2.bx.psu.edu/view/steffen):*
    * [covenntree](https://toolshed.g2.bx.psu.edu/view/steffen/covenntree): CoVennTree compares up to three rooted trees at the same time. CoVennTree (Comparative weighted Venn Tree) is a software to analyze and compare up to three datasets. Unlike other methods, CoVennTree correlates data on the leaf level and transfers this information to the root node. CoVennTree works with numbers to compute weighted Venn diagrams for each node in the graph (rooted tree). Therefore any kind of input data can be processed as long as the data structure will be taken into account.

     Samtools is a set of utilities that manipulate alignments in the BAM format. It imports from and exports to the SAM (Sequence Alignment/Map) format, does sorting, merging and indexing, and allows to retrieve reads in any regions swiftly.

     Samtools is designed to work on a stream. It regards an input file '-' as the standard input (stdin) and an output file '-' as the standard output (stdout). Several commands can thus be combined with Unix pipes. Samtools always output warning and error messages to the standard error output (stderr).

     Samtools is also able to open a BAM (not SAM) file on a remote FTP or HTTP server if the BAM file name starts with 'ftp://' or 'http://'. Samtools checks the current working directory for the index file and will download the index upon absence. Samtools does not retrieve the entire alignment file unless it is asked to do so.
