There are [a plenitude of Galaxy related events coming up](/events/) in the next few months, including *large regional meetings in Europe and Africa.*

## GCCBOSC 2018 Training Topic Voting Closes Jan 31

[<img class="float-right" src="/images/logos/gcc-bosc-2018-logo-300.png" width="160" alt="GCCBOSC 2018: Vote for the Training Topics you want" />](/events/gccbosc2018/training/)

**Which is tomorrow.  [Vote now](http://bit.ly/gccbosc2018-vote)**

[Your vote](http://bit.ly/gccbosc2018-vote) will determine the topics that are offered, which topics should be offered more than once,  and which ones should not be scheduled at the same time.  Your vote matters.

[GCCBOSC2018](https://gccbosc2018.sched.com/) will be held 25-30 June in Portland, Oregon, United States. It will feature two days of training: the second of which is multi-track and will feature content for both the BOSC and Galaxy communities.  Workshops will be hands-on and participants will be strongly encouraged to bring a laptop and follow along.  If you work in data-intensive biomedical research, there is no better place than GCCBOSC 2018 to present your work and to learn from others.

*Thanks to everyone who nominated topics and helped write topic descriptions!*


*GCCBOSC2018 registration will open in February.*  Watch this space.

# Public Galaxy Server News

There are [over 90 publicly accessible Galaxy servers](/use/) and [six semi-public Galaxy services](/use/).  Here's what happened with them last month, including two new public servers:

[<img class="float-right" src="/use/archive/a-game/agame-logo.png" alt="A-Game" width="150" />](http://beaconlab.it/agame)

## A-Game

[A-Game](http://beaconlab.it/agame) is *A Galaxy suite for tArgeted MEtagenomics*, a web service incorporating state of the art tools and workflows for the analysis of eDNA sequence data. A [site manual](http://159.149.160.68/galaxy/static/manual/) and [example workflows](http://159.149.160.68/galaxy/workflow/list_published) are available.

A-Game is supported by [BEACON](https://bioscienzebio.unimi.it/gruppo.php?id=26) at the [Dipartimento di Bioscienze](https://bioscienzebio.unimi.it/), [University of Milan](http://www.unimi.it/ENG/)


## Splicescope

[<img class="float-left" src="/use/archive/splicescope/zhang-lab.png" alt="Splicescope" width="240" />](http://galaxy.splicebase.net/)

[Splicescope](http://galaxy.splicebase.net/) is a tool-publishing server for predicting neuronal maturation using splicing profiles. Splicescope takes either an exon inclusion ratio matrix file or junction bed files from multiple samples as input and outputs a zip file including prediction results, PCA analysis results and a PCA plot based on reference samples and an html file to summarize the prediction.

Splicescope can be accessed anonymously, or with an account, and anyone can create an account.  It is supported by the [Zhang Laboratory](https://zhanglab.c2b2.columbia.edu/index.php/Main_Page), Department of Systems Biology, the Department of Biochemistry and Molecular Biophysics, and the Motor Neuron Center at Columbia University Medical Center.

### blend4php 0.1 beta

[<img class='float-right' src="/images/galaxy-logos/blend4phpLogo.png" alt="blend4php" width="220" />](https://github.com/galaxyproject/blend4php)

The beta version of the [blend4php package](https://github.com/galaxyproject/blend4php), a PHP wrapper for the [Galaxy API](https://docs.galaxyproject.org/en/master/api_doc.html), was released in December. It provides a PHP package for interacting with Galaxy and CloudMan. blend4php currently offers a partial implementation of the Galaxy API and includes support for datasets, data types, folder contents, folders, genomes, group roles, groups, group users, histories, history contents, jobs, libraries, library contents, requests, roles, search, tools, toolshed repositories, users, visualizations and workflows.

The motivation for development of this library is for integration with [Tripal](http://tripal.info/), an open-source toolkit for creation of online genomic, genetic and biological databases.

Please see the [API documentation](http://galaxyproject.github.io/blend4php/) page for full information.

### galaxy-lib 17.9.10

galaxy-lib is a subset of the Galaxy core code base designed to be used as a library. This subset has minimal dependencies and should be Python 3 compatible.  It's available from [GitHub](https://github.com/galaxyproject/galaxy-lib) and [PyPi](https://pypi.python.org/pypi/galaxy-lib).

This revision:

* Added docs for using mulled-build with your own quay.io account (thanks to @jerowe).
* Catch errors in Conda search if nothing is found (preventing planemo-monitor from functioning properly) (thanks to @bgruening).
* Make multi-requirement container building via mulled more stable (thanks to @bgruening).

### Planemo 0.47.0

[<img class="float-right" src="/images/galaxy-logos/planemo-logo.png" alt="Planemo" width="200" />](https://pypi.python.org/pypi/planemo/)

[Planemo](https://pypi.python.org/pypi/planemo) is a set of command-line utilities to assist in building tools for the Galaxy project.  These releases included [numerous fixes and enhancements](https://github.com/galaxyproject/planemo/blob/master/HISTORY.rst).

Other packages that have been released in the prior 4 months.

### sequence_utils 1.1.2

Galaxy's [sequence utilities](https://github.com/galaxyproject/sequence_utils) are a set of Python modules for reading, analyzing, and converting sequence formats.  See the [release notes](https://github.com/galaxyproject/sequence_utils/blob/master/HISTORY.rst) for what's new this month.

### StarForge 0.3.1-5

[StarForge](https://github.com/galaxyproject/starforge) help build Galaxy things in virtualization:

* Build Galaxy Tool Shed dependencies
* Build Python Wheels (e.g. for the Galaxy Wheels Server)
* Rebuild Debian or Ubuntu source packages (for modifications)

These things will be built in Docker. Additionally, wheels can be built in QEMU/KVM virtualized systems.  StarForge has had several updates this fall.  Fixes and new features include:

* Support xz/lzma tarballs for wheel builds Pull Request 166
* Native support for auditwheel and delocate. (#160)
* Do not build sdists with the wheel subcommand by default. (#155)
* Fix a bug where the wrong working directory was set when building wheels with multiple sources. (#154)
* Fix a bug with sudo and brew install on macOS. (#151).
* Short circuit platform caching on OS X (#150).

## And the rest ...

Other Galaxy packages that haven't had a release in the past four months can be [found on GitHub](https://github.com/galaxyproject).
