# The Galactic Blog

[<img class="float-right" src="/images/galaxy-logos/galactic-blog-400.png" alt="The Galactic Blog is born" width="200" />](/news/)

The new *[Galactic Blog](/news/)* was launched in October.  The *Galactic Blog* is a place for longer-form posts that are relevant to Galaxy. (See [Galaxy News](/news/) for shorter-form items.) The *Galactic Blog* replaces the former *Community Log* and includes all content from it, which is why, even though the blog is new, it includes entries back to 2013.

The blog is off to a running start with these posts in October:

* [ELIXIR Galaxy Community](/news/2017-10-05-elixir-galaxy-community/), by Frederik Coppens, Gildas Le Corguillé, and [Björn Grüning](/people/bjoern-gruening/)
* [Public Galaxy Server Dashboard](/news/2017-10-public-galaxy-dashboard/), by [Helena Rasche](/people/helena-rasche/)
* [SciPy and scikit-learn integration into Galaxy](/news/2017-10-10-scipy-galaxy/), by [Björn Grüning](/people/bjoern-gruening/)
* [Small genome assembly in Galaxy](/news/2017-10-16-unicycler-tutorial/), by [Anton Nekrutenko](/people/anton/)
* [Galaxy: the first 5,000 pubs](/news/2017-10-5000-pubs/), by [Dave Clements](/people/dave-clements/)

## The Galactic Blog needs you!

The Galaxy community needs to know what you are doing.  If you have done something that others would benefit from knowing then please create a *Galactic Blog* post describing your experiences.

Blog posts can either be directly created on the Hub, or can be posted on your favorite blogging platform and linked to from the [Blog home page](/news/).  See [the CONTRIBUTING page](https://github.com/galaxyproject/galaxy-hub/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md#blog-metadata) for how.

Questions? [Ask us](mailto:outreach@galaxyproject.org).

# Events

## Galaxy (and GMOD) at Plant and Animal Genome XXVI

[<img class="float-right" src="/events/2018-pag/galaxy-at-pag-2018.png" alt="Galaxy at PAG XXVI" width="200" />](/events/2018-pag/)

The [26th Plant and Animal Genome Conference](http://intlpag.org/) will be held January 13-17, in San Diego, California.  PAG is the largest ag-genomics meeting in the world and [Galaxy will be there](/events/2018-pag/) to help researchers get the most from their data.  There will be a [Galaxy Workshop with 4 talks](https://pag.confex.com/pag/xxvi/meetingapp.cgi/Session/4796), and a Galaxy Community Update talk during the [GMOD session](https://pag.confex.com/pag/xxvi/meetingapp.cgi/Session/4806).  See the [Galaxy @ PAG page](/events/2018-pag/) for details.  (We'll also list Galaxy related posters and Digital Tools and Resources talks once they are scheduled.)

### GMOD @ PAG

<img class="float-right" src="/images/logos/gmod-in-san-diego-300.png" alt="GMOD at PAG XXVI" width="200" />

[GMOD](https://gmod.org/) (of which Galaxy is a part) has a bunch of things going on at PAG that are of interest to the Galaxy Community:

* [Meg Staton](http://gst.tennessee.edu/people/meg-staton/) will [speak about](https://pag.confex.com/pag/xxvi/meetingapp.cgi/Paper/28295) the Tripal-Galaxy bridge
* There will be a [GMOD workshop](https://pag.confex.com/pag/xxvi/meetingapp.cgi/Session/4806) on the last day of PAG.
* The [Tripal Project](https://tripal.info) will have a user meeting on January 11, and a hackathon on January 12. [Register here](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1klQwUqaT_KxPKIfGYy_3rtGnOMVhJxEoD9dZ4PGc4yg/edit).
* GMOD will have a project-wide hackathon on January 11-12.

If you are interested in supporting better integration of Galaxy with other GMOD components then please give the two hackathons a look.

# Public Galaxy Server News

There are [over 90 publicly accessible Galaxy servers](/use/) and [six semi-public Galaxy services](/use/).  Here's what happened with them in October.

## Public Servers in October's Publications

As part of the move to Zotero, we have started tagging papers that use, mention, implement or extend public Galaxy Servers with the server name.  Here are the counts for October's papers.

| # | Server | | # | Server | | # | Server | | # | Server |

## Citation sections added to Public servers directory

The [public Galaxy server directory](/use/) was updated in October to include a *Citation(s)* section for each server.  If you use a server in your research, then please cite it.

## BF2I-MAP

[<img class="float-right" src="/use/bf2i-map/bf21-map-sponsors.png" alt="BF2I-MAP" />](http://bf2i-galaxy.insa-lyon.fr:8080/)

The [BF2I-MAP](http://bf2i-galaxy.insa-lyon.fr:8080/) server features locally developed (as well as standard tools) including ThreaDNA, which "allows generalising the approach to a large class of DNA-binding proteins." ([Cevost et al.](https://doi.org/10.1093/bioinformatics/btx634)).  BF2I-MAP is supported by the [Laboratoire de Microbiologie, Adaptation et Pathogénie](http://map.univ-lyon1.fr/), [Biologie Fonctionnelle Insectes et Interactions](http://bf2i.insa-lyon.fr/), [L'Université Claude Bernard Lyon 1](https://www.univ-lyon1.fr/), and [INSA de Lyon](https://www.insa-lyon.fr/)

**Citations**

* [ThreaDNA: predicting DNA mechanics’ contribution to sequence selectivity of proteins along whole genomes](https://doi.org/10.1093/bioinformatics/btx634) by Jasmin Cevost, Cédric Vaillant and Sam Meyer, *Bioinformatics*, btx634, doi: 10.1093/bioinformatics/btx634, Published: 09 October 2017
* [BF2I-MAP tagged publications](https://www.zotero.org/groups/1732893/galaxy/tags/%3EBF2I-MAP) in [Galaxy Publication library](/publication-library/).



## Almost a public server: Language Analysis Portal

[<img class="float-right" src="/images/logos/clarino-logo-trans.png" alt="UiO Language Analysis Portal" />](http://www.mn.uio.no/ifi/english/research/projects/clarino/)

One of this month's highlighted papers ([Kouylekov et al](https://www.clarin.eu/sites/default/files/Kouylekov-CLARIN2017_paper_37.pdf)) describes the Language Analysis Portal, which is built on Galaxy and is described as:

> The [UiO Language Analysis Portal (LAP)](http://www.mn.uio.no/ifi/english/research/projects/clarino/) enables non-technical end users to employ state-of-the-art tools for natural language processing processing (NLP) at the click of a few buttons; a typical scenario is for a user to upload some ‘raw’ textual data, invoke LAP linguistic analysis tools to create annotations of the text, export processing results into a format suitable for analysis by the user, and download the resulting file(s) back onto their own computer.

LAP is part of the national implementation in Norway of the [European Common Language and Technology Infrastructure (CLARIN)](http://clarin.eu).

It's always great to see Galaxy applied in non-genomic domains, and LAP is a great example of how this can be done.  Unfortunately, it falls just short of the definition of a [public Galaxy server](/use/). Alas, it is accessible to many, but not all academic users.  So we recommend taking a look at it, but we can't list it in the directory.

# Releases

## StarForge 0.3.1-5

[StarForge](https://github.com/galaxyproject/starforge) help build Galaxy things in virtualization:

* Build Galaxy Tool Shed dependencies
* Build Python Wheels (e.g. for the Galaxy Wheels Server)
* Rebuild Debian or Ubuntu source packages (for modifications)

These things will be built in Docker. Additionally, wheels can be built in QEMU/KVM virtualized systems.  StarForge has had several updates this fall.  Fixes and new features include:

* Support xz/lzma tarballs for wheel builds Pull Request 166
* Native support for auditwheel and delocate. (#160)
* Do not build sdists with the wheel subcommand by default. (#155)
* Fix a bug where the wrong working directory was set when building wheels with multiple sources. (#154)
* Fix a bug with sudo and brew install on macOS. (#151).
* Short circuit platform caching on OS X (#150).

[<img class="float-right" src="/images/galaxy-logos/pulsar_transparent.png" alt="Pulsar" width="170" />](https://pypi.python.org/pypi/pulsar-app/)

A [Pulsar](https://pypi.python.org/pypi/pulsar-app/) update was released in September.  Pulsar is a Python server application that allows a Galaxy server to run jobs on remote systems (including Windows) without requiring a shared mounted file systems. Unlike traditional Galaxy job runners - input files, scripts, and config files may be transferred to the remote system, the job is executed, and the results are transferred back to the Galaxy server - eliminating the need for a shared file system.

[This release](https://github.com/galaxyproject/pulsar/blob/master/HISTORY.rst) adds several features and 4 bug fixes.

### nebulizer 0.4.2

[Command-line utilities](https://pypi.python.org/pypi/nebulizer/) to help with managing users, data libraries and tools in a Galaxy instance, using the Galaxy API via the BioBlend library.

* [Documentation](https://nebulizer.readthedocs.io)
* [Code](https://github.com/pjbriggs/nebulizer)

*CAVEAT nebulizer is still a work in progress; please exercise caution when attempting irreversible operations especially against production Galaxy instances (for example when creating users or data libraries).*

### CloudBridge 0.3.3

[CloudBridge](https://github.com/gvlproject/cloudbridge) aims to provide a simple layer of abstraction over different cloud providers, reducing or eliminating the need to write conditional code for each cloud. It is currently under development and is in an Alpha state.
