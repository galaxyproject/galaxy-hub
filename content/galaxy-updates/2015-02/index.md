# Events

## GCC2015: 6-8 July, Norwich UK

<div class='left'><a href='http://gcc2015.tsl.ac.uk/'><img src="/images/logos/GCC2015LogoWide600.png" alt="Sponsor GCC2015" width="170" /></a></div>

The [2015 Galaxy Community Conference (GCC2015)](http://gcc2015.tsl.ac.uk/) is the Galaxy community's annual gathering of users, developers, and administrators.  [Previous GCC's](/events/gcc2014/) have drawn over 200 participants, and we expect that to happen again in 2015.  GCC2015 is being hosted by [The Sainsbury Lab](http://tsl.ac.uk/) in Norwich, UK, immediately before [BOSC](http://www.open-bio.org/wiki/BOSC_2015) and [ISMB/ECCB](http://www.iscb.org/ismbeccb2015) in Dublin.

### Early Registration opens in February

*Early* registration (save *heaps)* and [abstract submission](http://gcc2015.tsl.ac.uk/abstracts/) will open later in February.  If you work in data-intensive life science research, then it is hard find a meeting more relevant than GCC2015.  We look forward to seeing you there.

## 19 February GalaxyAdmins Meetup

<div class='left'><a href='/community/galaxy-admins/meetups/2015-02-19/'><img src="/images/logos/GalaxyAdmins.png" alt="GalaxyAdmins meetup February 19" width="150" /></a></div>

The first [GalaxyAdmins](/community/galaxy-admins/) [meetup of 2015](/community/galaxy-admins/meetups/2015-02-19/) will happen online on Thursday, 19 February.  [GalaxyAdmins](/community/galaxy-admins/) is a special interest group for Galaxy community members who are responsible for Galaxy installations.

A summary of both the user and admin/developer [2014 Galaxy Community Questionnaires](/news/2014-questionnaire/) will be presented by [Dave Clements](/people/dave-clements/), a *Galaxy Project Update* will be offered by a [Galaxy Team member](/galaxy-team/), and   [Hans-Rudolf Hotz](/people/hansrudolf-hotz/) will lead a short discussion on *[GalaxyAdmins](/community/galaxy-admins/) direction*.

Thanks to everyone for letting us know what dates and times worked best for you.  This time and day of the week worked for a remarkable 91% of respondents.

## January Baltimore Area Galaxy Meetup Report

<div class='right'><a href='/events/meetups/baltimore/2015-01-22/'><img src="/events/meetups/baltimore/GalaxyBaltimoreMeetupLogo400.png" alt="January 2015 Galaxy Baltimore Meetup" width="150" /></a></div>

The [first Baltimore Area Galaxy meetup](/events/meetups/baltimore/2015-01-22/) *was sold out.* It was the right mix of current Galaxy users, people who want to learn how to use Galaxy, and students in Biology/Computer science programs. It was good to see academics unwind with a few beers and talk about their ideas to use Galaxy. The idea behind the meetup was to build a local community of Galaxy users, and to get to know one another personally. This would in turn foster collaborations and also bring forward better feedback to the [Galaxy Team](/galaxy-team/) as well.

The second meetup is going to be hosted in February, for which we hope to have a slightly more focussed agenda. To talk about one or a few of the topics raised during the course of the month. There is now a Baltimore newsletter if you are interested) which goes out to the members who signed up for the first meetup. We hope to have more people in the coming months, and to grow a stronger Galaxy community in Baltimore.

# New Public Servers

Several new [public Galaxy servers](/use/) were added in January.

## RiboGalaxy

<div class='right solid'><a href='http://ribogalaxy.ucc.ie/'><img src="/use/ribogalaxy/ribogalaxy-logo.png" alt="RiboGalaxy" width="200" /></a></div>

[RiboGalaxy](http://ribogalaxy.ucc.ie/) provides on-line tools for the analysis and visualization of ribo-seq data obtained with the ribosome profiling technique. It is a freely available web server for processing and analysing ribosome profiling (ribo-seq) data with the visualization functionality provided by [GWIPS-viz](http://gwips.ucc.ie/). RiboGalaxy provides a compact suite of tools specifically tailored for the alignment and visualization of ribo-seq and corresponding mRNA-seq data. Users can take advantage of the published workflows on RiboGalaxy which reduce the multi-step alignment process to a minimum of inputs.

RiboGalaxy has its own dedicated [Help page](http://ribogalaxy.ucc.ie/static/help.html). Please post any questions you may have on our [RiboGalaxy Forum](http://gwips.ucc.ie/Forum/). Anonymous users can use RiboGalaxy. However, the upload and processing of datasets larger than 2GB and the use of advanced features such as published workflows, will require the user to be registered on RiboGalaxy.

RiboGalaxy is supported by [Science Foundation Ireland](http://www.sfi.ie/).


## CardioVascular Research Grid (CVRG)

# New Releases

## Galaxy 2015-01-13 Distribution

<div class='right'><a href='http://getgalaxy.org'><img src="/images/logos/GetGalaxyOrg.png" alt="width=175" /></a></div>

**[Complete News Brief](http://wiki.galaxyproject.org/DevNewsBriefs/2015-01-13)**

**Security**

Several *critical* security vulnerabilities were recently discovered by Bartlomiej Balcerek and Mateusz Stahl at the [Wroclaw Centre for Networking and Supercomputing](http://www.wcss.pl/en/). This [stable Galaxy release contains fixes for those vulnerabilities](/archive/dev-news-briefs/2015-01-13/#security). **The Galaxy Team strongly encourages Galaxy server administrators to update their Galaxy servers immediately.**

**IPython Integration**

Thanks to the awesome work of community members [Björn Grüning](/people/bjoern-gruening/) and [Helena Rasche](/people/helena-rasche/), [Galaxy now features integration with the popular IPython project](/archive/dev-news-briefs/2015-01-13/#ipython-integration). The [Galaxy-IPython](https://github.com/bgruening/galaxy-ipython) project has been merged into Galaxy core and made into a generic plugin framework of interactive environments based on Docker.

** Tool Form Upgrade (for Beta Testing) **

In Galaxy's development branch, the basic tool from has been [redesigned and modernized to address certain limitations in Galaxy's responsiveness when working with longer forms containing multiple parameter choices](/archive/dev-news-briefs/2015-01-13/#tool-form-upgrade-for-beta-testing). This new tool form will become the default with the next release - but we are hoping tool author's and power users enable it and provide feedback during this release cycle in order to ensure it is working ideally when it becomes the default.

## Planemo 0.2.0

Version 0.2.0 of [Planemo](https://github.com/galaxyproject/planemo/blob/master/README.rst) was released in January.  Planemo is a set of command-line utilities to assist in building tools for the Galaxy project.  Updates included:

* Improvements to way Planemo loads its own copy of Galaxy modules to prevent various conflicts when launching Galaxy from Planemo. ([Pull Request 56](https://github.com/galaxyproject/planemo/pull/56))
* Allow setting various test output options in ``~/.planemo.yml`` and disabling JSON output.
* More experimental Brew and Tool Shed options that should not be considered part of Planemo's stable API. See [this presentation](http://bit.ly/gxbrew1) for more details.
* Fix ``project_init`` for BSD tar (thanks to [Nitesh Turaga](/people/nitesh-turaga/) for the bug report.)
* Documentation fixes for tool linting command (thanks to [Nicola Soranzo](/people/nicola-soranzo/)).

## BioBlend

[BioBlend v0.5.2 was released in October](/news/bio-blend-v0-5-2/).  [BioBlend](https://github.com/galaxyproject/bioblend) is a python library for interacting with CloudMan and the [Galaxy API](/develop/api/).  In January the [BioBlend source](https://github.com/galaxyproject/bioblend) was moved to the [galaxyproject Github account](https://github.com/galaxyproject).

## CloudMan and blend4j

New versions [CloudMan](/galaxy-updates/2014-09/#august-2014-cloudman-release), and [blend4j](/galaxy-updates/2014-09/#blend4j-011-release) were released in August.

    * [mirdeep2_mapper](https://toolshed.g2.bx.psu.edu/view/rnateam/mirdeep2_mapper): MiRDeep2 Mapper - process and map reads to a reference genome The mapper module is designed as a tool to process deep sequencing reads and/or map them to the reference genome. The module works in sequence space, and can process or map data that is in sequence fasta format. A number of the functions of the mapper module are implemented specifically with Solexa/Illumina data in mind.
    * [mirdeep2_quantifier](https://toolshed.g2.bx.psu.edu/view/rnateam/mirdeep2_quantifier): Imported from capsule None fast quantitation of reads mapping to known miRBase precursors The module maps the deep sequencing reads to predefined miRNA precursors and determines by that the expression of the corresponding miRNAs. First, the predefined mature miRNA sequences are mapped to the predefined precursors. Optionally, predefined star sequences can be mapped to the precursors too. By that the mature and star sequence in the precursors are determined. Second, the deep sequencing reads are mapped to the precursors. The number of reads falling into an interval 2nt upstream and 5nt downstream of the mature/star sequence is determined.
