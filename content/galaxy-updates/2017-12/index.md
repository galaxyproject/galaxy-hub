# Events

There are [a plenitude of Galaxy related events coming up](/events/) in the next few months:

## European Galaxy Administrator Workshop

[<img class="float-right" src="/images/logos/ElixirNoTextLogo.png" alt="Galaxy Admin training, this January, in Oslo " width="160" />](https://www.elixir-europe.org/events/european-galaxy-administrator-workshop)

**[Registration](https://skjema.uio.no/galaxy-admin-workshop-2018) opened in November for the [European Galaxy Administrator Workshop](https://www.elixir-europe.org/events/european-galaxy-administrator-workshop)**.  

* Mon 8 January 2018 to Fri 12 January 2018 CET
* Python room, Blindern, UiO campus, [Ole Johan Dahls hus](https://www.uio.no/english/about/getting-around/areas/gaustad/ga06/
), Gaustadall√©en 23B, Oslo, 0373, Norway

Although located in Europe, and named to reflect this, the workshop is definitely **open to a world-wide audience.** The workshop is a result of the collaboration between the [ELIXIR Galaxy WG](https://www.elixir-europe.org/about/groups/galaxy-wg) and the Galaxy Project, and so far known, this is the only Galaxy Admin workshop planned for 2018.

*Participants are to cover their own travel and accommodation, while the workshop participation is free of charge.*

The workshop is already close to full. If you are interested, you are encouraged to apply **right now**.

See the [full event description](https://www.elixir-europe.org/events/european-galaxy-administrator-workshop) for more.

## Galaxy (and GMOD) at Plant and Animal Genome XXVI

[<img class="float-left" src="/events/2018-pag/galaxy-at-pag-2018.png" alt="Galaxy at PAG XXVI" width="180" />](/events/2018-pag/)

The [26th Plant and Animal Genome Conference](http://intlpag.org/) will be held January 13-17, in San Diego, California.  PAG is the largest ag-genomics meeting in the world and [Galaxy will be there](/events/2018-pag/) to help researchers get the most from their data.  There will be a [Galaxy Workshop with 4 talks](https://pag.confex.com/pag/xxvi/meetingapp.cgi/Session/4796), and a Galaxy Community Update talk during the [GMOD session](https://pag.confex.com/pag/xxvi/meetingapp.cgi/Session/4806).  See the [Galaxy @ PAG page](/events/2018-pag/) for details.

### GMOD @ PAG

<img class="float-right" src="/images/logos/gmod-in-san-diego-300.png" alt="GMOD at PAG XXVI" width="160" />

[GMOD](https://gmod.org/) (of which Galaxy is a part) has a bunch of things going on at PAG that are of interest to the Galaxy Community:

* GMOD will have a [project-wide hackathon on January 11-12](http://gmod.org/wiki/2018_PAG_Hackathon).
* [Meg Staton](http://gst.tennessee.edu/people/meg-staton/) will [speak about](https://pag.confex.com/pag/xxvi/meetingapp.cgi/Paper/28295) the Tripal-Galaxy bridge
* There will be a [GMOD workshop](https://pag.confex.com/pag/xxvi/meetingapp.cgi/Session/4806) on the last day of PAG.
* The [Tripal Project](https://tripal.info) will have a user meeting on January 11, and a hackathon on January 12. [Register here](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1klQwUqaT_KxPKIfGYy_3rtGnOMVhJxEoD9dZ4PGc4yg/edit).

If you are interested in supporting better integration of Galaxy with other GMOD components then please give the two hackathons a look.

[<img class="float-right" src="/images/logos/csusm-logo.gif" alt="Introduction to Galaxy Workshop, CSU San Marcos, January 12" width="160" />](/events/2018-01-csusm-workshop/)

If you are at [Cal State San Marcos](https://csusm.edu/), or anywhere nearby, there will be an [Introduction to Galaxy Workshop](/events/2018-01-csusm-workshop/) in San Marcos, California on Friday January 12.  The workshop is free, but space is limited, so you are encouraged to [register now](http://bit.ly/gxy-csusm-2018-reg).

## 2018 Big Genomics Data Skills Training course

[<img class="float-left" src="/images/logos/jax-logo-no-text-200.png" alt="2018 Big Genomics Data Skills Training course" width="160" />](https://www.jax.org/education-and-learning/education-calendar/2018/may/big-genomic-data-skills-training-for-professors)

The [Jackson Lab (JAX)](https://www.jax.org/) is pleased to open the application period for the 2018 Big Genomics Data Skills Training course, funded by the NIH BD2K initiative: [Big Genomic Skills Training info and online application](https://www.jax.org/education-and-learning/education-calendar/2018/may/big-genomic-data-skills-training-for-professors). The program provides training and hands-on experience working with genomic scale data and will enable participants to integrate genomic data analysis into their courses or launch new courses. Topics covered include RNAseq, Whole Exome Sequencing and variant detection, ChIPseq and network analysis. Participants will gain experience using Galaxy, R and Python.

As a grant funded activity housing is included; however you will need to cover your own travel.  If you teach at an HBCU or Minority-serving institution (by Dept. of Education criteria) JAX may be able to provide a modest travel award.

*The course is for faculty who primarily teach undergraduate students* and will be held at JAX Genomic Medicine in Farmington CT, May 21-25.

# Public Galaxy Server News

There are [over 90 publicly accessible Galaxy servers](/use/) and [six semi-public Galaxy services](/use/).  Here's what happened with them in November.

## MiModD 0.1.8 Released

And it's available on the [MiModD NacreousMap](http://mapping-by-sequencing.vm.uni-freiburg.de:8080/) public Galaxy Server.  MiModD is a comprehensive software package for the identification and annotation of mutations in the genomes of model organisms from whole-genome sequencing (WGS) data.

## Public Servers in November's Publications

As part of the move to Zotero, we have started tagging papers that use, mention, implement or extend public Galaxy Servers with the server name.  Here are the counts for November's papers.

galaxy-lib is a subset of the Galaxy core code base designed to be used as a library. This subset has minimal dependencies and should be Python 3 compatible.  It's available from [GitHub](https://github.com/galaxyproject/galaxy-lib) and [PyPi](https://pypi.python.org/pypi/galaxy-lib).

This revision:

* Added docs for using mulled-build with your own quay.io account (thanks to @jerowe).
* Catch errors in Conda search if nothing is found (preventing planemo-monitor from functioning properly) (thanks to @bgruening).
* Make multi-requirement container building via mulled more stable (thanks to @bgruening).

### StarForge 0.3.1-5

[StarForge](https://github.com/galaxyproject/starforge) help build Galaxy things in virtualization:

* Build Galaxy Tool Shed dependencies
* Build Python Wheels (e.g. for the Galaxy Wheels Server)
* Rebuild Debian or Ubuntu source packages (for modifications)

These things will be built in Docker. Additionally, wheels can be built in QEMU/KVM virtualized systems.  StarForge has had several updates this fall.  Fixes and new features include:

* Support xz/lzma tarballs for wheel builds Pull Request 166
* Native support for auditwheel and delocate. (#160)
* Do not build sdists with the wheel subcommand by default. (#155)
* Fix a bug where the wrong working directory was set when building wheels with multiple sources. (#154)
* Fix a bug with sudo and brew install on macOS. (#151).
* Short circuit platform caching on OS X (#150).

### BioBlend 0.10.0

[BioBlend](http://bioblend.readthedocs.org/) is a Python library for interacting with CloudMan and Galaxy‚Äòs API.  BioBlend makes it possible to script and automate the process of cloud infrastructure provisioning and scaling via CloudMan, and running of analyses via Galaxy.

See the [release notes](https://github.com/galaxyproject/bioblend/releases) for what's new in release 0.10.0.


### Pulsar 0.8.0

[<img class="float-right" src="/images/galaxy-logos/pulsar_transparent.png" alt="Pulsar" width="170" />](https://pypi.python.org/pypi/pulsar-app/)

A [Pulsar](https://pypi.python.org/pypi/pulsar-app/) update was released in September.  Pulsar is a Python server application that allows a Galaxy server to run jobs on remote systems (including Windows) without requiring a shared mounted file systems. Unlike traditional Galaxy job runners - input files, scripts, and config files may be transferred to the remote system, the job is executed, and the results are transferred back to the Galaxy server - eliminating the need for a shared file system.

[This release](https://github.com/galaxyproject/pulsar/blob/master/HISTORY.rst) adds several features and 4 bug fixes.

### nebulizer 0.4.2

[Command-line utilities](https://pypi.python.org/pypi/nebulizer/) to help with managing users, data libraries and tools in a Galaxy instance, using the Galaxy API via the BioBlend library.

* [Documentation](https://nebulizer.readthedocs.io)
* [Code](https://github.com/pjbriggs/nebulizer)

*CAVEAT nebulizer is still a work in progress; please exercise caution when attempting irreversible operations especially against production Galaxy instances (for example when creating users or data libraries).*

### CloudBridge 0.3.3

[CloudBridge](https://github.com/gvlproject/cloudbridge) aims to provide a simple layer of abstraction over different cloud providers, reducing or eliminating the need to write conditional code for each cloud. It is currently under development and is in an Alpha state.  

## And the rest ...
