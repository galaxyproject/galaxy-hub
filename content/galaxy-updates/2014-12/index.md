Welcome to the December 2014 *[Galaxy Update](/galaxy-updates/)*, a summary of what is going on in the Galaxy community. *[Galaxy Updates](/galaxy-updates/)* complement the *[Galaxy Development News Briefs](/docs/)* which accompany new Galaxy releases and focus on Galaxy code updates.  

# Events

## Galaxy Day: 3 December, Paris

The [French Working Group GALAXY-IFB (Institut Français de Bioinformatique)](http://www.ifb-galaxy.org/index.html) is organizing a second [Galaxy Day](http://www.ifb-galaxy.org/GALAXYDAYS2014.html) around the Galaxy portal.  The event will be at Institut Curie in Paris over two days.  This year, we want to involve two communities: *biologists* (also known as Galaxy 'users') and *bioinformaticians* (Galaxy 'developers').  The goal is to present user experience around the portal, from a single user to a wider community:

* Dec 3 (09:00-17:00)
    * Galaxy's user experiences, and discussion on how the platform is (or is not) useful for building analysis.
    * Technology talks (new environment, Galaxy in production, ...)

Interested? Please contact [ifb DOT galaxy AT sb DASH roscoff DOT fr](mailto:ifb DOT galaxy AT sb DASH roscoff DOT fr) for more information.

<br />

# Mailing Lists Moved

The [Galaxy mailing lists](/mailing-lists/) have been moved from the lists.bx.psu.edu domain to the lists.galaxyproject.org domain.  This transition should be largely transparent, but there are a few things to be aware of:

* List sender addresses and headers will change to reflect the updated domain: from bx.psu.edu to galaxyproject.org.  
* Existing email filters you have set up may require adjustments.
* Posts from lists.galaxyproject.org could be categorized as spam until you train your filtering method.

The prior bx.psu.edu list posting email addresses will continue to accept email, which will be forwarded to the new list addresses.

# New Galaxy-Training Mailing List

The [Galaxy-Training mailing list](https://lists.galaxyproject.org/archives/list/galaxy-training@lists.galaxyproject.org/) is for anything related to training with Galaxy and training about Galaxy.  Galaxy-Training is also the official mailing of the [Galaxy Training Network](https://training.galaxyproject.org/), a world-wide group of training organizations that give Galaxy-based training.

If you are at all interested in Galaxy Training then you are encouraged to [join the list](https://lists.galaxyproject.org/archives/list/galaxy-training@lists.galaxyproject.org/). Messages to this list are publicly archived and will be included in the [Galaxy search engine](/search/) as well.

<div class='right'><a href='https://training.galaxyproject.org/'><img src="/images/logos/GTNLogo600.png" alt="Galaxy Training Network" width="200" /></a></div>

*And please welcome the latest member of the Galaxy Training Network:*

* [HSPH Bioinformatics Core (HBC)](http://bit.ly/gxytrnhbc), Boston, Massachussetts, United States

This brings total membership to [22 training organizations on 5 continents](http://bit.ly/gxytrnmap).

# New Public Servers

Two new [public Galaxy servers](/use/) were announced in November:

## Pitagora-Galaxy

<div class='right solid'><a href='http://try.pitagora-galaxy.org/galaxy/'><img src="/use/archive/pitagora-galaxy/pitagora.png" alt="Pitagora-Galaxy" width="300" /></a></div>

* *Links:*
    * [Pitagora-Galaxy Server](http://try.pitagora-galaxy.org/galaxy/)
    * [Pitagora-Galaxy Project](http://www.pitagora-galaxy.org/about_en)
* *Domain/Purpose:*
    * The public, general purpose Galaxy servers of the [Pitagora-Galaxy Project](http://www.pitagora-galaxy.org/about_en). This server is intended for testing and sharing. Heavy analysis should be performed using the project's identical virtual machine (VM) or Amazon Machine Image (AMI).
* *Comments:*
    * "We are running a website for sharing users' know-how, and distributing a virtual environment where we configured Galaxy with selected workflows and tools. Now, you can perform our analysis workflows on the following three environments.
        * Access to the public web site for testing.
        * Download the virtual machine to your own PC or server.
        * Launch AMI (Amazon machine image) on AWS cloud.
    Since Pitagora-Galaxy enables us to run the same workflows on any infrastructure and rebuild the environments in any time, we can quickly use Galaxy, and at the same time, ensure the reproducibility of the analyses. In addition, we plan to add a connector for Garuda Desktop, a desktop application platform, for data analyses that cannot be covered only with Galaxy tools.

# ToolShed Contributions

## Galaxy Project ToolShed Repos

Here are new contributions for the past *two* months.

In no particular order:

### Tools

* *From [peterjc](https://toolshed.g2.bx.psu.edu/view/peterjc):*
    * [mira_datatypes](https://toolshed.g2.bx.psu.edu/view/peterjc/mira_datatypes):  Defines 'mira' datatype for the MIRA Assembly Format. Note that Galaxy already has a 'maf' datatype for the Multiple (sequence) Alignment Format (MAF). This is specifically for the MIRA Assembly Format (also called MAF). Previously only on the Test Tool Shed.
    * [clc_assembly_cell](https://toolshed.g2.bx.psu.edu/view/peterjc/clc_assembly_cell): Galaxy wrapper for the CLC Assembly Cell suite from CLCBio. This is a wrapper for the commercial "CLC Assembly Cell" suite from CLCBio which includes a de novo assembler and read mapper: http://www.clcbio.com/products/clc-assembly-cell/  Uploaded v0.0.2, previously only on the Test Tool Shed.
    * [seq_composition](https://toolshed.g2.bx.psu.edu/view/peterjc/seq_composition): Uploaded v0.0.1 (with embedded citation). Sequence composition. Counts the letters in given sequence files, returning a table listing them with percentages. Suitable for use on assemblies or gene/protein sets. Probably not suitable for raw NGS reads.
    * [mira4_assembler](https://toolshed.g2.bx.psu.edu/view/peterjc/mira4_assembler): MIRA 4.0 assembler Wrapper for core functionality of assembly tool MIRA 4.0.  Accepts data from Solexa/Illumina, Roche 454, Ion Torrent, PacBio and Sanger capillary sequencing.  The key MIRA output files are captured, but the other files are deleted when the job finishes.

    * [bedtools](https://toolshed.g2.bx.psu.edu/view/iuc/bedtools): bedtools: a powerful toolset for genome arithmetic Collectively, the bedtools utilities are a swiss-army knife of tools for a wide-range of genomics analysis tasks. The most widely-used tools enable genome arithmetic: that is, set theory on the genome. For example, bedtools allows one to intersect, merge, count, complement, and shuffle genomic intervals from multiple files in widely-used genomic file formats such as BAM, BED, GFF/GTF, VCF. While each individual tool is designed to do a relatively simple task (e.g., intersect two interval files), quite sophisticated analyses can be conducted by combining multiple bedtools operations.
