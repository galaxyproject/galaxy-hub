# Events

There are [a plenitude of Galaxy related events coming up](/events/) in the next few months:

## GCCBOSC 2018 Training Nominations Extended to January 12

**[Nominate a training topic now](http://bit.ly/gccbosc2018-tr-nom)**.

[<img class="float-left" src="/images/logos/gcc-bosc-2018-logo-300.png" width="160" alt="GCCBOSC 2018: Nominate Training Topics" />](http://bit.ly/gccbosc2018-tr-nom)

The joint [2018 Galaxy Community and Bioinformatics Open Source Conferences](https://gccbosc2018.sched.com/) start with training and **the training topics are determined by you**.  **Topic nominations have been extended January 12**. Any topics of interest to these communities can be nominated.

[GCCBOSC2018](https://gccbosc2018.sched.com/) will be held 25-30 June in Portland, Oregon, United States. It will feature two days of training: the second of which is multi-track and will feature content for both the BOSC and Galaxy communities.  

Nominated topics can cover a wide range. For example:

- How to use open source software using just a web browser (e.g., Intro to Using Galaxy)
- How to use software packages (The Newbie's Guide to BioRuby)
- Advanced applications of software (Genome Assembly with Galaxy, or Proteomics with BioPython)
- Software installation and configuration (Tool Wrapping for Galaxy, or Using CloudLaunch)
- Open source community (Building a Curation Community using Apollo, or Training using the Galaxy Training Network)

*These are only examples.* If you are looking for ideas, see topics nominated for [GCC2017](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1jyCndVqfXx-HsyFJ4hjaK075vDbPM1kE58qO2lJTOG8/edit?usp=sharing), [GCC2016](http://bit.ly/gcc2016noms), [GCC2015](http://bit.ly/gcc2015vote), and the [Galaxy Events page](/events/), which lists what training the community is offering outside of GCCs.  Training is not limited to Galaxy-related topics.  *Don't be afraid to think inside the BOSC!*

Nominated topics have been, and will continue to be [published](/events/gccbosc2018/training/) as they come in. Topics will be compiled into a uniform list by the GCCBOSC2018 organizers, and then voted on by the community later this month.

## Galaxy (and GMOD) at Plant and Animal Genome XXVI

[<img class="float-right" src="/events/2018-pag/galaxy-at-pag-2018.png" alt="Galaxy at PAG XXVI" width="180" />](/events/2018-pag/)

The [26th Plant and Animal Genome Conference](http://intlpag.org/) will be held January 13-17, in San Diego, California.  PAG is the largest ag-genomics meeting in the world and [Galaxy will be there](/events/2018-pag/) to help researchers get the most from their data.  There will be (at least):

- a [Galaxy Workshop with 4 talks](https://pag.confex.com/pag/xxvi/meetingapp.cgi/Session/4796),
- a Galaxy Community Update talk during the [GMOD session](https://pag.confex.com/pag/xxvi/meetingapp.cgi/Session/4806)
- 10 other Galaxy-related talks, and
- 12 Galaxy-related posters.
- 4 pre-conference [GMOD](#gmod-pag) and [Galaxy](#intro-to-galaxy-workshop-at-csusm) events

## 2018 Big Genomics Data Skills Training course

[<img class="float-right" src="/images/logos/jax-logo-no-text-200.png" alt="2018 Big Genomics Data Skills Training course" width="160" />](https://www.jax.org/education-and-learning/education-calendar/2018/may/big-genomic-data-skills-training-for-professors)

The [Jackson Lab (JAX)](https://www.jax.org/) is pleased to open the application period for the 2018 Big Genomics Data Skills Training course, funded by the NIH BD2K initiative: [Big Genomic Skills Training info and online application](https://www.jax.org/education-and-learning/education-calendar/2018/may/big-genomic-data-skills-training-for-professors). The program provides training and hands-on experience working with genomic scale data and will enable participants to integrate genomic data analysis into their courses or launch new courses. Topics covered include RNAseq, Whole Exome Sequencing and variant detection, ChIPseq and network analysis. Participants will gain experience using Galaxy, R and Python.

As a grant funded activity housing is included; however you will need to cover your own travel.  If you teach at an HBCU or Minority-serving institution (by Dept. of Education criteria) JAX may be able to provide a modest travel award.

*The course is for faculty who primarily teach undergraduate students* and will be held at JAX Genomic Medicine in Farmington CT, May 21-25.

- Short circuit platform caching on OS X (#150).

### BioBlend 0.10.0

[BioBlend](http://bioblend.readthedocs.org/) is a Python library for interacting with CloudMan and Galaxy‘s API.  BioBlend makes it possible to script and automate the process of cloud infrastructure provisioning and scaling via CloudMan, and running of analyses via Galaxy.

See the [release notes](https://github.com/galaxyproject/bioblend/releases) for what's new in release 0.10.0.


### Pulsar 0.8.0

[<img class="float-right" src="/images/galaxy-logos/pulsar_transparent.png" alt="Pulsar" width="170" />](https://pypi.python.org/pypi/pulsar-app/)

A [Pulsar](https://pypi.python.org/pypi/pulsar-app/) update was released in September.  Pulsar is a Python server application that allows a Galaxy server to run jobs on remote systems (including Windows) without requiring a shared mounted file systems. Unlike traditional Galaxy job runners - input files, scripts, and config files may be transferred to the remote system, the job is executed, and the results are transferred back to the Galaxy server - eliminating the need for a shared file system.

[This release](https://github.com/galaxyproject/pulsar/blob/master/HISTORY.rst) adds several features and 4 bug fixes.


## And the rest ...

Other Galaxy packages that haven't had a release in the past four months can be [found on GitHub](https://github.com/galaxyproject).
