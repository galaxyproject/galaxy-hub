title: Set up your own community

<div class='right'><img src="/images/undraw-illustrations/mind_map.svg" alt="" width="240" /></div>


There are many communities established within Galaxy. We call them [Special Interest Groups](/community/sig/). We have SIGs based for example on:
- their [**region**](/community/#regional-communities) around the world - these are regional communities,
- their [**domain of science**](/community/#communities-of-practice) - these are communities of practices in different scientific domains,
- their [**topics of interest**](https://galaxyproject.org/community/wg/), such as systems, back-end, user interface - these are working groups. 

We encourage you to look through those communities and if you find one that it is appropriate for your needs, you can join and contribute to that community. However, if you don't find a community that fits your work, domain or region, or don't feel identified with any of them, you can create your own community of practice!

Below you'll find suggested recipes to follow before, during and after you can start your own community, and a list of Do's and Don'ts and also useful links you should probably check out.

### Community Onboarding Cookbook

Here we outline a few "recipes", or set of steps, you can follow to address different aspects of creating, growing and sustaining, a new community. We refer to these set of recipes as our **Community Onboarding Cookbook** or **Community Propeller**. If you have ideas of new recipes, please do get in touch.

The recipes vary from some technical aspects and where to find help, as well as the social aspects related to creating a community, and encouraging participating and collaboration. 

There are multiple general guidelines for starting open source communities that you can use, including: 
- [The Turing Way](https://the-turing-way.netlify.app/index.html), which is a handbook for reproducible, ethical and collaborative data science developed in the [Turing Institute](https://www.turing.ac.uk/) UK, includes guidelines on [Managing a New Community and Team](https://the-turing-way.netlify.app/collaboration/new-community)
- Guidelines on [Starting a community - taking your software to the world](https://www.software.ac.uk/guide/starting-community-taking-your-software-world) published by the UK [Software Sustainability Institute](https://www.software.ac.uk/). 
- The OSSWatch guidelines on [How to build an open source community](http://oss-watch.ac.uk/resources/howtobuildcommunity)
- [It Takes A Village](https://itav.lyrasis.org/) is a framework for open-source communities (originally from the cultural and scientific heritage domain, but applicable to other areas) to develop sustainability strategies. It offers a guidebook, a toolkit and information about their communities. 

Some of the recipes in this cookbook will customize those guidelines to the specific application to the Galaxy Community.

#### Learn the basics about Galaxy

First of all, you should start with our dedicated [**Get Started**](/get-started/) page to get a head-start of what Galaxy is about.
You'll find all the necessary resources and you could even participate in the [**Galaxy Mentorship Network**](https://galaxy-mentor-network.netlify.app/)
to get started with the help of a Galaxy Mentor.

#### Learn about Tool Development
Galaxy has many tools already installed and ready to be used but when creating your community, you'll probably need specific tools for your Galaxy analysis. Don't worry, see our dedicated page for [**Tool Authors**](/tools/) where you'll find everything you'll need and also reach out to the [**Tools Working Group**](/community/wg/) via Gitter.

Don't forget to follow the [**Best Practices**](https://galaxy-iuc-standards.readthedocs.io/en/latest/best_practices.html) for writing [**Galaxy Tools**](https://toolshed.g2.bx.psu.edu/).

#### Get involved
- Introduce yourself and dive in our [Working Groups](https://galaxyproject.org/community/wg/).
- Participate in our worldwide [Galaxy Events](https://galaxyproject.org/events/).
- If you want to start your own [Special Interest Group](/community/sig/) we encourage you to read the [Galaxy Community Board](/community/governance/gcb/#creating-a-new-sig) page.

### Create communication channels for your community
- We strongly recommend you create your community chat. Reach out to our Lobby in [**Gitter**](https://gitter.im/galaxyproject/Lobby) or [**Matrix**](https://app.element.io/#/room%2F%23galaxyproject_Lobby%3Agitter.im) and ask the admins to create your Community Chat.
- Setting up a mailing list is also another available option by sending an email to outreach@galaxyproject.org although we strongly recommend to use a Community Chat.


### Do's and Don'ts 

<div class='right'><img src="/images/undraw-illustrations/questions.svg" alt="" width="180" /></div>

This curated table was made with the help of Community member's experience in hope to avoid obstacles in your path to create your Community.

| __DO__  | __DON'T__  |
|---|---|
| Be patient! Take the time to learn the basics about Galaxy. | Hurry and dive in straight  to create without knowing a lot about Galaxy and its workarounds. |
| Ask if a tool for what you need already exists before starting to develop one. | Get hazy with all your tool's possible needs as there are many installed already that can be close to what you would like.|
| Request your tool to be reviewed, avoid managing your repo alone! | Be a lone wolf. The main servers may not want to install your tool as they want to make sure it follows the [**standards**](https://galaxy-iuc-standards.readthedocs.io/en/latest/best_practices.html) they have defined for developing tools. |
| When you happen to need a tool: Make the tool -> write the training -> set up an event. Repeat events and take advantage of Galaxy’s infrastructure (Smorgasbord, CoFests, GCC, etc.) to improve your tool ,maximize its use and receive feedback from the community. | Set to create very specific tools and avoid feedback. |
| Use already established servers. Asking for a subdomain within the [**usegalaxy.eu**](https://usegalaxy.eu/) server is a great option! |Set up a server all by yourself (consider resources, complexity, security issues and more).|
